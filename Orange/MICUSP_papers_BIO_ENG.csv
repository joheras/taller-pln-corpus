BIO.G0.15.1,Invading the Territory of Invasives: The Dangers of Biotic Disturbance,Biology,Argumentative Essay,"New York City, 1908: different colors of skin swirl in the great melting pot to produce a cultural medley. Now imagine such a metropolis spreading to cover every last crevice on Earth. Over time, people will weave to produce an unprecedented uniformity; once discrete identities would be lost. Our heritages will be remembered only by the history texts in the hands of our progeny. A similar effect can be observed in environmental systems: we are in danger of losing our global biodiversity to a monotonous fate. The threat of invasive species is now greater than the world has ever witnessed. The number of introductions caused by international commerce is enormous (Mooney and Cleland, 2001). Although only a small portion of emigrants survive, those survivors have aggregated to form a giant global problem of bioinvasions (Mack et al., 2000). Extensive studies have been done on many exotics, such as the zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha, and their biological and ecological threats prompt human interest and intervention (Facon et al., 2006). Environmentalists advocate the awareness of invasive species and governments spend millions to purge them. However, species removal is not as simple as it seems; we must be aware that the removal of an invasive causes ecosystem disturbance, just like its introduction, and hasty action can cause irreparable damage to our global asset of biodiversity. Extensive and specific studies of the risks and rewards of invasive species removal should be done before any actions to control a bioinvasion. The greatest danger in dealing with invasive species involves risks in disturbing an ecosystem, especially one that's already threatened by an exotic. There are many studies being done on the effects of these unwanted immigrants, but precise mechanisms for these ecological disturbances are still unclear (Mack et al., 2000). Even less understood are the consequences of their removal. A study on the effects of introduced trout on frogs showed that native populations can dramatically rebound upon extirpation of the invasive predator (Vredenburg 2004). However, studies like this may not have strong implications on the majority of bioinvasions. This study was carried out in isolated mountain pools. With the exception of the introduced trout, these ecosystems have had minimal disturbance and human contact. This is quite different from many other bioinvasions that happen in peoples' backyards. Insufficient understanding of invasive mechanisms can have catastrophic ramifications. In French Polynesia, the predatory land snail Euglandina rosea was deemed a fix to the economical threats of the giant African land snail Achatina fulica. Convinced by experiences with A. fulica in Hawaii, a hasty French Polynesian government set this invasive control project into action (O'Foighil 2006). The resultant extinction of nearly all endemic Partulid species is a painful lesson today (Coote and Loeve, 2003). Hawaii and French Polynesia are both pacific archipelagos, but their differing ecosystems led to the tragedy of the Partulids. Thus historical precedence cannot always be generalized and applied to foreign problems. Specific studies of any target invasive and ecosystem must be done before drastic actions are carried out. The removal process itself is extremely tedious and in some cases near impossible. The removal of trout from five isolated lakes in Sixty Lake Basin of California took six years (Vredenburg 2004). Similar cleansing of downstream lakes that could receive upstream fish would require even greater efforts. In the case of E. rosea in French Polynesia, removal is thought to be impossible. The carnivorous snail has infested every corner of numerous French Polynesian islands, eliminating any possibility of Partulid reintroduction (Coote and Loeve 2006). The ability of bioinvaders to hybridize with native species to produce a spectrum of pseudo-exotics exacerbates difficulties faced. This is most common among plants, which can also undergo extremely rapid evolution (Callaway and Maron, 2006): in England native species of the genus Senecio have readily hybridized with exotics to produce offspring that have taken over the country (Facon et al. 2006). In such cases, total extirpation of non-natives would require the elimination of more than one species and looms as a truly daunting task. As can be seen, removal projects are not always pragmatic or even possible. Studies like the English Senecio project help elicit the mechanisms for bioinvasion and gauge the practicality of control projects so we do not waste effort on an impossible task. Similar research should be done on all exotics before invasive removal projects. The economic costs of invasive species total over one hundred billion dollars a year in the United States alone, and millions more are spent to control or eliminate them (Mack et al., 2006). However, the benefits of such projects aren't always clear even upon completion. We assume the noble goal of restoring a native ecosystem, yet actual outcomes can be less-than-equitable compromises. In the mid 20th century the United States government extirpated arctic foxes that had been introduced to the Aleutian archipelago fifty years earlier (Croll et al., 2005). Now half a century later, once fox-infested islands still bear the scars of the bioinvasion despite the success of the fox removal project. Seabirds are slow to recolonize the once dangerous islands, and the lack of guano leaves them under blankets of tundra. Again, research to understand the mechanisms of bioinvasions could have helped predict this outcome and prevent implementation of such wasted efforts. We launch invasive removal projects to save the natives; however, are we actually helping them by removing an invasive? Environments that have been exposed to an exotic for sufficiently long periods have reestablished equilibrium: species have developed adaptations to cope with their new neighbors. Off the coast of New England, mussels exposed to predatory crabs develop thicker shells as protection (Freeman and Byers, 2006). In Australia, snakes evolved smaller relative head sizes to cope with the introduced toxic cane toads (Phillips and Shine, 2004). These morphological changes represent investments to increase fitness in altered habitats. The energy cost of these features is balanced by an increased ability to survive. By removing invaders, we are eliminating the benefits of their adaptations. These disturbances would leave the native species with just the adverse costs of thickened shells and smaller heads. In dealing with bioinvasions, we must consider not only the native species, but also the dynamic ecosystems. Disturbances can draw out unforeseen effects; like the fox removal project in Alaska, a disturbance with the noblest of purposes can fall short of recovery. Invasive species are a threat to the world's biodiversity, but their removal can be just as hazardous. Even with the right goal, without proper planning and sufficient studies to understand target ecosystems, projects in invasive removal can prove futile or even produce dire consequences. Fortunately for Partulids in French Polynesia, at least one extant member of each endangered clade has been discovered and some hope of recovery still exists (O'Foighil 2006). Yet many organisms have no immediate relatives: the dead clades walking are survivors of past mass-extinction events and their loss would be irreparable (Jablonski 2001). When controlling the global problem of invasive species, prevention outshines restoration. Most modern invasives are spread by artificially, either as unwitting stowaways or intentional imports. However for the average citizen, the awareness of biodiversity is often masked by personal, political, and economic concern. The threat of bioinvasions must be publicized and personalized. Only thru the aggregation of countless personal efforts can a global threat be contained. In New Zealand, invasive trout are a publicly supported economic boon (Townsend 2003). Any extensive lobbying for the continued existence of a species is admirable. If people were just as aware of the value in their endemic biodiversity, curbing the spread of exotic species would take an easier turn.

BIO.G1.04.1,The Evolution of Terrestriality: A Look at the Factors that Drove Tetrapods to Move Onto Land,Biology,Argumentative Essay,"The fish-tetrapod transition has been called the greatest step in vertebrate history (Long and Gordon, 2004) and even one of the most significant events in the history of life (Carroll, 2001). Indeed, the morphological, physiological, and behavioral changes necessary for such a transformation in lifestyle to occur are astounding. The sum of these modifications occurring during the Devonian and Carboniferous led to the eventual filling of the terrestrial realm with vertebrate life, forever altering the structure and ecology of terrestrial communities. Long and Gordon (2004) cited six critical questions relating to the evolution of tetrapods. These questions aimed to ascertain which sarcopterygian fish were basal to tetrapods, how morphological changes occurred sequentially, and when, where, how, and why these changes took place. Many researchers have described the morphological changes that occurred (Clack, 2002b; Eaton, 1951; Jarvik, 1955; Long and Gordon, 2004; Thomson, 1993), and others have focused specifically on the development of limbs and digits (Clack, 2002b; Coates and Clack, 1990; Coates et al, 2002; Daeschler and Shubin, 1995; Shubin et al, 1997; Shubin et al, 2004). As Long and Gordon (2004) pointed out, the question that is the least well answered is the question of why these modifications occurred. Exactly what factors drove these changes to take place? Many researchers have posited theories over the years attempting to answer this question, and the aim of this paper is to assess these arguments and suggest some possible common causes that could tie many of the proposed causal factors together. However, a brief description of known data pertaining to the time and place of tetrapod origins is first necessary in order to make valid statements regarding possible influential factors. The first tetrapods (defined as vertebrates with paired limbs and digits) appeared during the Late Devonian, and it is now well-accepted that the panderichtyid fish are the sister group to tetrapods (Carroll, 1995; Long and Gordon, 2004). Prior to the past couple of decades, very few Devonian tetrapod taxa were known: mainly Ichthyostega and Acanthostega, both from the uppermost Famennian. The discovery of possible tetrapod trackways in Australia and Brazil (Bray, 1985; Warren and Wakefield, 1972) stretched the potential range of tetrapods back into the Frasnian, and these speculations were supported by the discovery of Elginerpeton, the oldest known stem tetrapod, from the Late Frasnian about 368 million years ago (mya) (Figure 1) (Ahlberg, 1995; Carroll, 1995). Figure 1. Stratigraphic appearances and interrelationships of early tetrapods. Adapted from Long and Gordon (2004). However, it is important not to necessarily equate limbs and digits with terrestriality. Classically, the idea was that limbs developed to enable tetrapods to locomote on land. Jarvik (1955) originally reconstructed Ichthyostega in such a way that implied terrestriality, but a recent analysis indicates that Ichthyostega was not well-adapted for terrestrial locomotion (Ahlberg et al, 2005). It is now assumed that limbs with digits evolved completely for aquatic adaptation (Ahlberg and Milner, 1994; Ahlberg et al, 2005; Carroll, 1995; Clack, 2002b; Coates and Clack, 1990; Daeschler and Shubin, 1995; Lebedev, 1997). Romer (1958) even pointed this out, differentiating between the development of limbs giving the potentiality of terrestrial existence, and⬦the utilization of these limbs for life on land. The earliest fully terrestrial tetrapod appears to be Pederpes from the Tournaisian about 354 to 344 mya (Figure 1) (Clack, 2002a; Long and Gordon, 2004). Given the constraints imposed by the fossil record, it appears that the evolution of terrestriality took place in tetrapods between the Frasnian of the Late Devonian and the Tournaisian of the Early Carboniferous some time between 368 and 344 mya. An analysis of the environmental and ecological conditions imposed on creatures during this timeframe can help elucidate the major factors that drove terrestriality in tetrapods. Before making assertions about these environmental and ecological pressures, it is first necessary to locate where tetrapods were likely evolving. This question of place involves at least two aspects: (1) where geographically they were evolving, and (2) where ecologically they were evolving, i.e. whether they were evolving in marine or freshwater conditions. Geographically, the first early tetrapod specimens collected were from the Old Red Sandstone of North America and western Europe (Clack, 2002b; Jarvik, 1955), and the majority of Late Devonian tetrapods have been concentrated in localities on the southern coastal belt of the Euramerican plate, in what is modern-day Scotland, Greenland, eastern North America, and the Baltic states (Clack, 2002b; Daeschler and Shubin, 1995; Milner, 1990). Some authors hypothesized an East Gondwanan origin of tetrapods based on the Australian trackways (Milner, 1993), but the discovery of Frasnian-age panderichthyids and tetrapods in Latvia and Russia offer strong support for a Euramerican origin of tetrapods (Ahlberg, 1995; Clack 2002b; Daeschler and Shubin, 1995). However, it is clear that by the end of the Famennian, tetrapods had achieved a broad geographic distribution in equatorial regions from Euramerica all the way to Australia and even China (Daeschler, 2000; Daeschler, et al, 1994; Long and Gordon, 2004; Milner, 1993; Zhu, et al, 2002). As for marine versus freshwater considerations, it has traditionally been hypothesized that tetrapods evolved in freshwater conditions and that seasonal drying of these water bodies had driven terrestriality (Clack, 2002b; Gordon and Olson, 1995; Long and Gordon, 2004; Milner, 1990; Thomson, 1993). Some authors have argued that certain factors in freshwater conditions that could have driven terrestriality would have exerted an even stronger influence in marine conditions. For instance, Packard (1974, 1976) argued that anoxia would be even more of a problem in marine habitats than it is in freshwater habitats. However, other authors have argued that the intertidal habitats for early vertebrates proposed by Schultze (1999, quoted in Graham and Lee, 2004; Long and Gordon, 2004) would not have exhibited a strong enough selective force to initiate air breathing or the invasion of land (Graham and Lee, 2004). Most modern amphibians are unable to live in salt water (Clack 2002b), and most amphibian fossils have been discovered in what appear to be freshwater environments (Bendix-Almgreen, et al, 1990; Clack, 2002b; Daeschler, 2000; Long and Gordon, 2004). However, Bray (1985) and Clack (2002b) noted that it is not always easy to distinguish between fluvially-influenced and tidally-influenced sediments. Bray (1985) hypothesized that tetrapods evolved in marginal marine rather than freshwater conditions, arguing that there was less of a salinity gradient between fresh and salt water in the Devonian than there is today. He noted that the density of terrestrial plants at that time was likely less than what we have today, which would allow weathering to occur at a higher rate, thus increasing the dissolved ion concentration in freshwater. Recent fossil finds have included some early tetrapods from possible tidal, lagoonal, marginal marine, and/or brackish water sediments (Carroll, 2001; Clack, 2002b; Daeschler and Shubin, 1995; Janvier, 1996; Long and Gordon, 2004), as well as evidence that many early sarcopterygians dwelt in marine habitats (Clack, 2002b; Thomson, 1993). Some authors have even suggested that the apparent widespread geographic range of early tetrapods (from modern-day North America to Australia and China) could only be a result of dispersal through epicontinental seas (Carroll, 2001; Daeschler, 2000; Thomson, 1993). While the evidence is not necessarily conclusive of either freshwater or marine origins, recent evidence seems to indicate that tetrapods likely arose in marginal marine and possibly lowland freshwater environments, and it is possible that they could have been tolerant of both marine and freshwater conditions, as are many modern vertebrate types (Clack, 2002b; Daeschler and Shubin, 1995). So it appears that tetrapods evolved in some sort of coastal wetland environment around the margins of the Euramerican plate during the Late Devonian. An analysis of terrestrial flora, fauna, climate, and geography at this time could help elucidate some of the factors that would have favored terrestriality in these earliest tetrapods. The advent of land plants had important evolutionary consequences for terrestrial life. During the Silurian, the first terrestrial plants (mainly lichens, liverworts, and moss-like plants) evolved and were able to grow in habitats near the shore (Kenrick and Crane, 1997). True vascular plants with stomata evolved by the end of the Silurian (Clack, 2002b), and by the end of the Devonian, many other advanced characteristics had already evolved as well, including leaves, roots, sporangia, seeds, and secondary growth allowing plants to have a tree-like habit (Algeo and Scheckler, 1998; Edwards, 1998; Kenrick and Crane, 1997). Frasnian floras were dominated by progymnosperms, including Archaeopteris trees with trunks in excess of a meter in diameter (DiMichele and Hook, 1992; Edwards, 1998). At the Frasnian-Famennian boundary, an extinction event occurred that resulted in significant changes to the constituent flora (Clack, 2002b). As the plants recovered during the Famennian, species diversity and structural complexity of floral communities increased; multi-storied forests developed, and different plant groups evolved down distinct ecological lines (Algeo and Scheckler, 1998; DiMichele and Hook, 1992; Kenrick and Crane, 1997). These developing forests generated oxygen as a photosynthetic waste product, thus increasing its abundance in the atmosphere and making the land a much more suitable place for animal life (Bray, 1985; Clack, 2002b). By the Late Silurian and Early Devonian, there was already a complex terrestrial ecosystem in place, which included arthropod populations. Centipedes, millipedes, arachnids, mites, scorpions, and other terrestrial arthropods were all present by this time (DiMichele and Hook, 1992; Gordon and Olson, 1995; Jeram, et al, 1990; Kenrick and Crane, 1997). They appear to have been mainly predators and detritivores (Kenrick and Crane, 1997), thus establishing themselves as a major link between animals and plants (DiMichele and Hook, 1992). The radiation of these terrestrial invertebrates likely had a strong influence on the later radiation of terrestrial vertebrates. The classical idea regarding climate in the Late Devonian was that it was a time of warm, arid conditions with only seasonal rainfall (Barrell, 1916; Bendix-Almgreen et al, 1990; Clack 2002b; DiMichele and Hook, 1992; Ewer, 1955; Long and Gordon, 2004; Orton, 1954; Romer, 1945, 1958, 1966; Warburton and Denman, 1961). The red beds in which the early tetrapods were found were thought to be indicative of arid conditions. However, Inger (1957) cited Krynine (1949) as demonstrating that red beds often form in non-drought conditions; thus, red beds in and of themselves are not necessarily indicative of aridity. Romer (1958) responded to Inger's arguments by citing evidence of aridity in these strata other than the red color, including associated evaporites and evidence of subaerial deposition. The consensus today is that at least some areas appear to have been semi-arid with seasonal rainfall, especially those areas that were around the equator (Gordon and Olson, 1995), but it is clear that not all Devonian rocks indicate arid conditions (Clack, 2002b). Figure 2. Late Devonian (Famennian) paleogeographic reconstruction from Scotese and McKerrow (1990) in Daeschler and Shubin (1995). Filled circles indicate tetrapod body fossils, and open circles represent trackways. During the Devonian, Euramerica (also known as Laurussia), consisting primarily of Laurentia and Baltica, is hypothesized as being in an equatorial position (Clack, 2002b; Daeschler and Shubin, 1995; Daeschler et al, 1994; DiMichele and Hook, 1992; Gordon and Olson, 1995; Scotese and McKerrow, 1990; Thomson, 1993). Gondwana lay southward, with the Iapetus Sea separating the two (Figure 2). While there is not necessarily a consensus as to how much ocean separated the two major continents during the Late Devonian (Daeschler 2000; Dalziel, et al, 1994; Milner, 1993; Thomson, 1993; Van Der Voo, 1988), it is agreed that the Iapetus Sea was in the process of closing up as Gondwana and Laurussia were moving closer, ultimately coming together in the Carboniferous (Clack, 2002b; Gordon and Olson, 1995; Van Der Voo, 1988). This tectonically active region would have had a great effect on the lives of early tetrapods as their habitats were being resized, reshaped, and eventually eliminated. Over the years, many authors have considered these ecological and environmental factors and posited theories as to why tetrapods evolved into fully terrestrial creatures. Barrell (1916) was one of the earliest to propose that adverse climatic conditions were the driving factor in the origin of terrestriality. He cited the red beds in which early tetrapods had been found as evidence of aridity and hypothesized that shrinking pools of water during the dry season would have pushed amphibious tetrapods out onto land in order to survive. Romer (1945, 1966) advanced this theory, postulating that tetrapods evolved limbs in order to remain in the water. When these small pools dried up, those creatures with the stoutest limbs and most efficient terrestrial locomotion would be more likely to make it to another body of water and survive. He noted that amphibians and crossopterygians lived in the same habitat and argued that amphibians would have an obvious advantage if their habitat evaporated. He proposed that these short treks on land would eventually increase in duration as some amphibians would possibly linger on land to eat. For many years, this was the popular theory, and many authors proposed nuanced versions of this basic idea. During the 1950s, a series of papers was published on this topic. Orton (1954) espoused the possibility that limbs may have been a digging adaptation. She cited extant amphibians digging aestivation burrows to stay moist when surrounding conditions got dry rather than dispersing to find another body of water. However, even she noted that there are many burrowing animals that are able to do so without any limbs at all. Ewer (1955) suggested that early tetrapods did not leave the shrinking ponds simply because their habitat was shrinking; rather, he noted that the receding habitat would have greatly increased population pressure, which would have triggered migration if environmental conditions were adequate. Gunter (1956) held to the basic Romer/Ewer theory, but he argued that the tetrapod limb had to be formed prior to these excursions. He emphasized that this was a gradual process, with the limbs first acting as props under water and the tetrapods making very short excursions onto land to escape predators or seek nearby food. The longer terrestrial excursions to escape the drying conditions were the final step of the process towards terrestriality. Goin and Goin (1956) theorized that competition for food was the major driving factor, citing the presence of arthropods in the shallows and on the shore that could have served as an untapped food source for early tetrapods, even though Romer (1958) argued that these food sources were not nearly adequate. In Inger's (1957) paper offering a different climatic interpretation, he noted that the hypothesized aridity would have caused a great desiccation problem for migrating amphibians; a humid climate would have offered more favorable migration conditions for early tetrapods. Warburton and Denman (1961) pointed out that in order to be a successful frog, one first must be a successful tadpole. They postulated that protoamphibians laid their eggs in shallow pools away from competition with larger lungfish and predators. Terrestrial locomotion would have been necessary for these larvae to get back to the water, and they pointed out that in this case, selection would be operating on a large number of individuals. This view was echoed by Gordon and Olson (1995) as well. Thomson (1993) considered the whole pool-drying scenario to be logically inadequate, instead claiming that ecological conditions had to be the driving factor. It was the emergence of wetlands that fostered the origination of terrestrial tetrapods, offering a moist environment with abundant new food sources and protection from predators. Sayer and Davenport (1991) conducted a study of modern-day amphibious fishes and found that they leave water under a variety of factors. Environmental degradation, including decreased oxygen content, increased temperature, and drastically fluctuating salinity, often causes fishes to evacuate the water. Biotic factors, such as competition for food and space, predation, feeding, and reproduction, can have a large influence as well. It is clear that a large number of potential factors could have played a role in the evolution of terrestriality, and because of this, the discussion of tetrapod origins has been unusually-theory laden (Thomson, 1993). Yet it is important to try and understand what conditions may have driven such an important evolutionary event. By analyzing the available evidence and assessing the validity of the many theories put forth, it may be possible to elucidate a small number of major factors that could have driven this critical occurrence in the history of life. Long and Gordon (2004) cited that both evolutionary pushes and pulls likely influenced the evolution of terrestriality. The pushes-the factors that encouraged tetrapods to leave the water-included poor environmental conditions, predators, competitors, diseases, and parasites. The pulls-the factors that encouraged tetrapods to come onto land-included favorable conditions, empty niches, abundant food resources, and a lack of predators, competitors, diseases, and parasites. The influences of all of these factors seem logical, so how can one disentangle them and determine the most important factors? Maybe it is not possible to sort out these factors and give some of them priority over others; they might all have been of equal importance. But if one or two primary causes could be determined that would have amplified the effects of these ecological factors, one could assign primary importance to these causes. The evolution of plants could have been one of these primary causes. In order for animals to move on to land, it first had to be habitable for them, and, as described earlier, the evolution of land plants drastically altered the composition of the atmosphere and formed the basis of new terrestrial ecosystems. The emergence of coastal wetlands offered an array of habitats previously unseen in earth's history (Thomson, 1993) and encouraged the evolution of terrestriality in arthropods. Despite Romer's (1958) objections that these food sources would not have been adequate, it is probable that even piscivorous fishes would have fed on these new prey items (Clack, 2002b; Goin and Goin, 1956; Thomson, 1993). There were no vertebrate predators on land, so this would basically have been an unexploited niche. Rather than competing with fish in the sea, they could have an untapped source of food on land as long as they could get to it. Yet, in addition to these evolutionary pulls, plants exerted some pushes on tetrapods as well. The evolution of deciduousness in plants could have played a crucial role. Not only would mass senescing of leaves have enhanced the terrestrial ecosystem by enriching soil development (an evolutionary pull), it also likely caused anoxia in near-shore waters (Algeo and Scheckler, 1998; Clack, 2002b). As the plant matter decayed in the water, oxygen levels in the water would have decreased. This situation could have encouraged air breathing in some fish (Sayer and Davenport, 1991), which was a requisite step in the transition to life on land. Certainly, of course, the fish could have merely come up to the surface to breathe air and survived that way, but as Sayer and Davenport (1991) pointed out, many modern-day fish do leave anoxic waters. The evolution of land plants clearly played a critical role in the evolution of terrestriality. They enhanced the terrestrial ecosystem and offered wide open niches, abundant invertebrate food resources, protection from predators, and an oxygen-rich atmosphere as opposed to anoxic waters. However, aside from the anoxia in the water, all of these would be considered evolutionary pulls rather than pushes. There had to have been some factors in their aquatic environment that made a move onto land-and all of the requisite changes-beneficial. The tectonic activity occurring in and around the Iapetus Sea at this time could have enhanced the effects of many various evolutionary pushes. As discussed previously, early tetrapod evolution appears to have been concentrated along the southern coast of Euramerica during the Late Devonian. During this time, Euramerica and Gondwana were converging, eventually forming Pangaea during the Permo-Carboniferous. This closing of the Iapetus Sea would have affected aquatic tetrapods living in this region in several ways. As the continents came together, the major direct effect would have been habitat loss, and this could happen in several ways. The convergence of continents would decrease the amount of coastlines and lower global sea level (Clack 2002b). The arrangement of the continents also led to a short period of global cooling and glaciation during the Famennian in Gondwana (Algeo and Scheckler, 1998; Johnson, et al, 1985; Van Der Voo, 1988). The uptake of water by glaciers would have lowered sea level as well. For tetrapods living in coastal habitats, these compounding factors would have led to a great decline in available habitat. As the amount of habitat decreased, previously separated populations of animals would be brought together into more of a confined space. In such a situation, the competition would be very intense. This recalls Ewer's (1955) emphasis on the importance of population pressure, as well as Goin and Goin's (1956) focus on competition, in tetrapod evolution. Clack (2002b) also noted that when previously separated populations are forced to share a common environment, the biodiversity would actually decrease, while distribution of the remaining species would increase. This intense competition would have been a strong evolutionary push for tetrapods to find another suitable habitat. When Inger (1957) was contesting the interpretation of red beds as indicative of an arid climate, he argued that discerning the stimulus that pushed terrestriality is dependent on one's climatic interpretation. And it is clear that there is not consensus about the climate in which early tetrapods evolved. But at the heart of Romer's classic scenario of tetrapods escaping drying pools is the loss of habitat. It has been suggested here that tectonic activity and its effects could have caused the habitat of early tetrapods to be lost; thus, an arid climate need not necessarily be a critical component in theories of the evolution of terrestriality. The evolution of terrestrial tetrapods has certainly sparked much discussion over the years, and deservedly so, for a rich terrestrial vertebrate fauna of about 360 million years is contingent on this event. During the Late Devonian, the first tetrapods made their way onto land. As their habitat was shrinking and causing fierce intra- and interspecific competition for resources in the shallows, a new habitat with abundant resources had been brought about by plants in the terrestrial realm. The filling of these new niches available on land forever changed the course of life on earth. To understand the full breadth of evolution, it is crucial to try and understand these landmark events in the history of life on this planet. The origin of new species depends on a complex combination of environmental conditions, ecological factors, and chance. The environmental conditions of the Late Devonian certainly made life difficult for aquatic organisms, as evidenced by the mass extinction event in the marine community (DiMichele and Hook, 1992; Johnson, et al, 1985; Long and Gordon, 2004); but had the opportunity for the colonization of land never been presented by the changes brought about by plants, the early aquatic tetrapods may have never survived long excursions in the terrestrial realm. The chance coincidence of increasingly poor quality and decreasingly abundant aquatic habitats, an emerging high quality terrestrial ecosystem, and the acquiring of morphological adaptations by the first tetrapods set the stage for one of the most important steps in the history of animal life.

BIO.G3.03.1,Intracellular Electric Field Sensing using Nano-sized Voltmeters,Biology,Argumentative Essay,"Intracellular electric fields are of great interest because of the important role they play in the biological processes of a cell. It is known that intracellular electric fields play a major role in sub-cell processes like cell division and DNA uptake, as well as on the macroscopic level of neural signaling and cardiac rhythm. The ability to study these electric fields, until recently, was limited to the use of voltage-sensitive dyes, voltage/patch clamps, fluorescent proteins, and fluorescent energy transfer methods. These methods are membrane-dependent and are limited to only detecting electric fields in/near organelles in intact cells (which account for less than .1% of entire cell volume). Electric fields permeate the entire cell, not just near and in the organelles, and in order to study and model certain biological processes more effectively, the electric field throughout the entire cell volume must be mapped. Also, more and more studies are currently underway investigating the effects of an externally applied electric field to a cells biology. It has been proven that external electric fields can be used to modify certain cell behaviors. However, with the aforementioned methods, detection of the intracellular electric fields response to an external field is limited both spatially and temporally. The invention and implementation of E-PEBBLES solves many of the issues associated with conventional cellular voltage measuring techniques. E-PEBBLES are nanosized voltmeters that can diffuse throughout the entire cell volume. The E-PEBBLES contain a voltage sensitive dye whose optical spectrum shifts according to the electric field present. The response time of the optical shift to a change in the surrounding electric field is instantaneous and thereby gives a real-time measurement of biological processes going on within the cell. The conventional voltage sensitive dyes measure voltage slightly differently. Once in the cell, the positively charged dye molecules diffuse across the cell along the electric field gradient toward the area of higher negative charge (usually to mitochondria). However, if the system is perturbed (i.e. by adding a toxin) resulting in the decrease of the electric field, the diffusion process reverses, but very slowly. Thus, this class of sensing dyes is classified as slow response and is virtually ineffective in measuring a cells real time response to stress.. Furthermore, voltage dyes tend to be sequestered selectively by cell compartments such as membranes. The E-PEBBLES on the other hand, are not only fast-response voltage sensors, but they can also be adapted to measure other physical parameters within the cell including temperature, pH, and viscosity. Another major advantage of E-PEBBLES is that they dont require recalibration once inside the cell. Calibration of sensors used in intercellular voltage measurements is a major issue for all of other methods. Once the sensor is introduced to the cells environment, there is some variation from cell to cell and in depth calibration schemes are needed to extract viable data or rid it of significant inaccuracies. The voltage sensitive dye used in the E-PEBBLES is encapsulated in a silane-capped micelle which provides a universal environment for the sensing dye, no matter what type of cell, cellular structure, or non-cellular environment the particle may be exposed to. This environment, along with only one required calibration, allows for a universal baseline for all measurements, no matter the nature of the specific experiment. The initial experiments completed with E-PEBBLES are very successful on every front; however, the calibration scheme needs to be improved to allow for even higher electric field measurements. Currently, in order to calibrate the E-PEBBLES they are put in an aqueous suspension or gel, and then loaded into a glass capillary. The capillary is attached to a cover slip and a pair of wires connected to a voltage supply using clear varnish and silver paint. Various voltages are applied to the E-PEBBLES and the emission images are collected and analyzed. Only voltages up to 1250V are able to be applied to the E-PEBBLES because once this voltage is surpassed the calibration device can short or arch, or the capillary can melt due to heating. Thus, the calibration curves used in the analysis of the cell data necessarily omits electric fields of more that 1.5(106) V/m. Also, because of the very nature of the calibration setup, there are significant variations in the slopes of the individual calibration curves, although overall the curves are all similar. The dye and the E-PEBBLES will most certainly work in the higher electric fields (up to 107 V/m), thus the need for a better calibration method is apparent. Better calibration techniques are currently being investigated, and the calibration curves used previously are being checked for their validity; thus, the goal now is to follow changes in the intracellular electric field as a cell undergoes natural processes or is exposed to physical and chemical stress with the use of confocal microscopy. The intracellular electric fields role in cell reproduction is not well understood, and of particular interest is the behavior of the electric field during cell division. The E-PEBBLES will allow the mapping of the intracellular electric field throughout the entire cell volume for the duration of the life cycle of a cell; mouse glioma or other cancer cells will be the first candidates for this type of study. Likewise, E-PEBBLES can be introduced into a cell and then through the use of chemical toxins and temperature, the immediate effects of these chemical and/or physical perturbations to the cells biology can be studied in real time and for many types of biological cells. From these types of studies invaluable information will be gained about a cells ability to readjust to its biological equilibrium and will be instructive in understanding what happens when a cells biological functions are perturbed. The experimental promise of E-PEBBLES lies in the fact that they are long-lasting and have been shown to be insensitive to pH, oxygen gradients, reactive oxygen species, and temperature. With the implementation of a more reliable calibration scheme for the E-PEBBLES, their adaptation into selective targeting sensors and/or sensors that can track temporal changes in electric field, temperature, and viscosity in both biological and non-biological systems is more realizable. The next step in E-PEBBLES sensing could be experiments that follow the changes in the intracellular electric field as the cell undergoes natural processes or when the cell is exposed to internal stress, such as due to cell division. Changes in a cells electric field can also be an indication of changes in a cells normal functioning and has been observed in Alzheimers disease or as a precursor to cell death. E-PEBBLES hold the promise of not only being experimental tools for sensing biological processes within a cell, but may eventually become medical diagnostic tools.

BIO.G0.11.1,Exploring the Molecular Responses of Arabidopsis in Hypobaric Environments: Identifying Possible Targets for Genetic Engineering,Biology,Proposal,"Environmental stresses to plants have been studied extensively in order to define mechanisms that are used by plants to defend against the stress. The focus of these studies includes drought, cold, heat, salinity, and hypoxia. However, space flights and theoretical missions to the moon and Mars require a low pressure environment to be considered. Plants will be essential in future space mission because they will be included in life support systems designed for astronauts. The molecular mechanisms used by plants to survive in a hypobaric environment are poorly understood, but recent studies have shown that a plant may borrow mechanisms from other stress responses to defend against the low pressures. Research has found that hypoxia, cold, and drought responses seem to be involved in a plant experiencing hypobaria. My studies seek to profile the gene expression patterns of Arabidopsis thaliana during a week long period of time in a low pressure environment by doing a transcriptome analysis. This information will give insight into when the necessary genes are activated or repressed, and the duration of the gene activity will reflect its importance in the stressful situation. It will also provide additional evidence of defense pathways that are shared between the stresses. It has also been shown that low pressures may cause plants to activate a defense response that is unneeded. The cold and drought responses are highly activated in Arabidopsis submitted to low pressures, but the plants showed no signs of wilting, browning, or loss in turgor pressure. This suggests that the plants perceive a lack of humidity and water, but in actuality the plants have enough amounts of water. My second study will attempt to block the defense responses to desiccation stress by creating mutant strains of Arabidopsis with non-functional transcription factors, and seeing the effect on the plants. CBFs and ABIs are known to bind to promoters in order to induce genes that control the production of LEA and COR proteins. By genetically engineering the reduction of the unneeded pathways, the plants will be able to save resources for other important functions. There has been a considerable amount of research done on the effects of environmental stresses such as drought, hypoxia, or heat stress, on plants. And for good reason too, as environmental stresses can reduce the growth rates of plants and decrease crop yields drastically. By studying the changing genome when plants acclimate to a new environment, we can devise biotechnological or genetic techniques to promote plant survival in the stressful conditions (1, 6). For example, by over-expressing LEA proteins, which are responsible for protecting against water deficits, rice gained improved resistance to salinity and drought (6). However, while we know a lot about mechanisms in various extremes, very little is known about the molecular responses of plants to low atmosphere pressures (1). Although this may seem trivial, the significance of hypobaric environments comes into play when the need to grow plants in space, moons, or planets arises. The growth of plants in space is a priority for NASA, since plants will be essential in long-term bioregenerative life support systems for astronauts (1, 3, 7). Greenhouses can be built to provide a somewhat controlled environment, but creating Earth-like pressures is near impossible and highly impractical, thus the ability of plants to tolerate low pressures will be necessary (1,4). Altered atmospheric pressures have been shown to have adverse as well as favorable affects on plant growth, though in all cases extensive adaptations need to happen (4, 7, 9). There is evidence that defense pathways for multiple stresses will simultaneously activate since low pressures will create an environment where: hypoxia can occur since oxygen will be limiting due to a lower partial pressure of oxygen outside of the plant (1, 4, 5, 7); cold and drought stress is perceived because of the lower vapor pressure, and thus lower water potential, outside plant cells (1, 4, 6, 7); heat stress could occur due to lowered conductive and convective cooling via transpiration, which would occur if the plant ceased respiration and closed stomata to defend against desiccation (1, 6). Because of the combined stresses, the final defense mechanism used by the plant can be very different from when it is only dealing with one stress. It has been shown that the combination of stresses, such as drought and heat, causes a distinct response from when the plant is exposed to either drought or heat alone (2). Genes that are expressed during a single stress may be repressed when exposed to a second stress. Similarly, genes repressed with a single stress, can become active when there are multiple stresses present (2). Hypobaric environments could trick plants into triggering multiple defense pathways, which in some ways could be agonistic or antagonistic to one another. An example of how pathways may be opposing is as following: when plants are under desiccation stress, plant cells will form compatible solutes such as proline or sugars to lower the water potential inside the cell, and also synthesize major intrinsic proteins (MIPs) such as aquaporins to increase water uptake (2, 6). When a plant is facing hypoxic conditions, which often occurs due to flooding, there is a major reduction in the MIPs present (5). If hypobaria does activate hypoxia pathways and drought pathways, then it will be interesting to watch the plant decide to increase or decrease the level of MIPs. There are an innumerable other examples of pathways which may complement each other or work against each other, and so one goal of my research would be to identify the pathways involved in a plant experiencing hypobaria. Additionally, it has been shown that when grown at one-tenth of Earth's atmospheric pressure, plants induce genes to defend against desiccation and hypoxia even though the plants were grown in a humid environment with plenty of water (4). The plants showed no loss in fresh weight or turgor pressure, so it suggests that the plants perceive low pressures as increased water loss. To accommodate for this, the plants start undergoing alternate metabolic and adaptation pathways. However, if these pathways aren't really needed, then the plant is wasting energy that it could use for growing and reproducing. The second goal of my research is to identify what stress responses I can knockout or knockdown, so that the plants can thrive in the environment without any slowdown. The plant of choice for my experiments will involve Arabidopsis thaliana, since the most is known about its genome, and almost every previous research study done on plant stresses has used Arabidopsis. To compare my results with them, I will also use Arabidopsis. To start off, I want to grow seedlings in a Low-Pressure Growth Chamber (LPGC) as done by Paul et al. and Musgrave et al. (4, 9). Unlike the previous two experiments, I will set the pressure even lower to 2 kPa, which is slightly above the average atmospheric pressure of 1 kPa on Mars (3, 7). The lowest pressure possible for plant survival is estimated to be around 1 kPa; this value takes into account the minimal partial pressures of water vapor, oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide needed by plants (8). I want to avoid going to the extreme low end to steer clear of unexpected complications. Since hypoxia is inevitable in low pressures, I will fix the air flowing through the LPGC to have an oxygen concentration of 9 mmol/L. At this concentration, I expect plant growth and respiration to be normal or even enhanced as described by Musgrave et al. (9). If necessary, a higher concentration of oxygen could be used if the seedlings continued to struggle with hypoxia. The other Martian conditions such as sunlight availability, atmospheric composition, and lower gravity are presumably not obstacles to plant growth as long as a greenhouse is providing an environment with optimal levels of CO2, O2, and UV protection (8). For my control, I will grow seedlings at the normal Earth pressure of 101 kPa. Past data has already shown that low atmospheric pressures do not negatively affect plant growth from a visual standpoint (1, 4, 9). The plants seem to tolerate the low pressures very well, and show no signs of wilting or loss of growth when germinated at low pressures; instead the plants are actually experiencing enhanced growth in many scenarios. To determine how the seedlings are altering their biochemical pathways to acclimate to a low pressure environment, I will use a microarray to do a transcriptome analysis on the hypobaric plants and control plants. I will utilize the same GeneChip for the Arabidopsis genome as used by Paul et al. in their experiment (4). Instead of just using tissue from the shoots of the plants however, I will also collect leaf tissue, and root tissue as well. This way I can see if there is differential expression between tissues. Detecting mRNA for a gene does not necessarily mean that it is being translated, but it will give insight on how the plant is preparing to defend against a stress. By comparing the microarrays from the control and hypobaric plants, it will be possible to tell which genes are differently expressed in the hypobaric plant. I will label mRNA from the control plant red, and mRNA from the hypobaric plants green. On the microarray, areas that are only green are genes uniquely expressed by hypobaric plants, yellow areas are genes expressed by both plants, and red areas are genes that are inferably repressed in hypobaric plants. I will be doing a time-course for gene expression microarrays by taking the RNA samples at different time intervals (30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 8 hours, 16 hours, and 24 hours) and then taking a final RNA sample a week after germination. The purpose of the time-course is to make sure we aren't overlooking genes that are being activated or repressed early in the stages of adaptation or late in the stages. Additionally, the Paul et al. experiment used 10 kPa whereas I'm using 2 kPa, so the effects of the lower pressure on the genome have yet to be seen. I expect to see a similar result as described in the Paul et al. experiment (4), but an added time-course will show if these genes they listed are activated from the start or at different times. With this information, we can identify which genes are crucial for the first step towards adaptation to a low pressure environment. Also, genes that become activated from the start and stay active throughout the whole process are more likely to be essential for dealing with stresses. For example, alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) is an enzyme that is essential for glycolysis to proceed, and since glycolysis is upregulated during times of stresses, I would expect much higher levels of ADH in the hypobaric plants the whole time (1, 2, 4, 5, 6). Identifying genes that are repressed is equally important, because certain genes can be harmful to the plant during a time of stress. For example, when dealing with drought stress, plants activate pathways to create higher levels of proline in the cell in order to lower the water potential among other reasons (6). But when faced with drought stress and heat stress, the pathways creating proline is repressed, and pathways creating sucrose and glutamine are induced instead since proline is thought to interfere with the heat stress response (2). After a week in the hypobaric environment, the seedling will have acclimated to the new low pressure environment, so the transcriptome produced at that time period will most likely reflect the final mechanisms the Arabidopsis seedlings are using. At the 24 hour time period and week time periods, I will use RT-PCR in order to quantify the degree of transcription for the hypobaria-induced clusters of genes as well as other genes of interest such as genes involved in glycolysis, C4 pathway, photorespiration, and aerobic respiration. The RT-PCR method I use will be the same one used by Paul et al. (4). I expect higher levels of mRNA for genes belonging to a hypoxic stress response, such as alcohol dehydrogenase and other genes in the fermentation pathway, as well as higher levels of genes corresponding to a drought stress response, such as LEA proteins and COR proteins, in the hypobaric plants than in the controls. I'm also interested in examining whether the levels of certain transcription factors (CBFs and ABIs) are raised. These transcription factors are essential in a drought stress response, and will be important in my second experiment (1, 6, 10). Seeing if Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs) rise in levels will be important as well for future experiments. I hypothesize that by the week time-period, the levels of mRNA in the hypobaria-induced cluster will have risen, or possibly dropped, to their optimal level (I will compare the expression between the week time-period and the 24 hour period). It is possible for mRNA levels for defense genes to rise in number, and then decline as time progresses as seen in the hypoxic stress response (5). Microarrays and RT-PCR will give us a much more comprehensive picture of what is happening in the hypobaric stress response. To end the first experiment, I will use Expression Analysis Systematic Explorer to investigate the results of my microarray experiment as done by Liu et al. (5). With this program, I will be able to identify biological themes within the gene list, identify the molecular functions and localization of gene products present, and I will have a more in depth perspective into the possible biochemical/metabolical pathways that are occurring as part of the stress response for hypobaria. The information provided from the first experiment will greatly increase understanding of the responses necessary to defend against low pressures, and will also help immensely in the design of genetically engineered plants for space missions. There have been countless observations that when plants are pre-acclimated to stressful environments, such as heat shock, hypoxia, or drought, the plants acquire a sort of tolerance to that stress (1, 6). A major strategy in creating plants that are pre-acclimated to a stress would be to engineer them to constitutively express genes that are responsible for the adaptive response (1). This might include introducing genes which take part in the adaptive response, or introducing genes coding for transcription factors to activate multiple genes that are part of the response. While this strategy will be useful for dealing with the hypoxia stress response and heat stress response, it could be ineffective with the cold and drought stress responses that the plants are exhibiting during hypobaria. When grown at 10kPa, Arabidopsis plants showed no signs of wilting, browning, or other symptoms of desiccation stress, even though the defense pathways for cold and drought stresses were being activated (4). If the desiccation response isn't necessary for adaptation to low pressure, and really is a side effect of the plant perceiving low pressures as lower humidity, then the induction of the pathways is causing a drain on metabolism. My second experiment would be to investigate how important the desiccation stress response actually is. I will do this by blocking the response pathways responsible for reacting to the stresses, and then growing the mutant plants in the LPGC at 2 kPa. Two classes of proteins have been identified as the major players in cold and drought stress. The LEA (late embryogenesis abundant) genes are important in the response against desiccation, and the COR (cold responsive) genes are vital in the response against freezing temperatures (1, 6). Since cold and drought stress are related stresses, as both cause water deficits, it is not uncommon to see both stresses sharing defenses. One way to knockdown the expression of the LEA and COR proteins would be to stop the activation of their promoters. There are two main pathways to activate these promoters: one that is dependent on the hormone ABA, and one independent of it. I will try to inhibit both pathways individually, and then at the same time. Since blocking ABA independent pathways is easier, it will be my first target. Numerous cold-induced genes and water-deficit genes are controlled by transcription factors, called CBFs (C-repeat binding factor) or DREBPs (DRE-binding protein), that bind to a DRE cis-element on the promoter (1, 6). I will create, or purchase, mutant Arabidopsis plants with dysfunctional CBFs/DREBPs. The preferred method of mutation would be gene knockouts so that the plants do not transcribe the mRNA, and thus no chance of translating the transcription factors. Silencer RNA would be a second option, but since it is more of a knockdown instead of a knockout, proteins could still sporadically be expressed. Also, I would have to apply the siRNA to all the tissues multiple times during the experiment. Without the proper transcription factors, almost none of the ABA-independent stress response genes could be activated. For example, CBF3 causes the activation of a few COR proteins and the activation of pathways to form compatible solutes such as proline and sugars to protect against water loss (1, 6). CBF1 has been shown to increase the expression of all of the COR proteins, showing its great importance (1, 6). By mutating the CBF/DREBP family of transcription factors, the stress response will be severely diminished and resources will be free to use for other cell functions. Similarly, ABA-induced genes have cis-elements on the promoter to bind different transcription factors. In Arabidopsis, the ABRE (ABA-responsive element) and CE (coupling element) sites bind ABI transcription factors, which are activated after an ABA signal-transduction event (6). I will create, or purchase, mutant Arabidopsis plants with dysfunctional ABI1 and ABI3 transcription factors since this combination totally disrupts desiccation stress responses (10). The method of mutation will be the same as above. Even though the ABI transcription factors aren't necessary for all of the water-deficit response genes, their loss of function will definitely reduce the quantity of LEA proteins and other desiccation induced proteins in the cell. For example, there are 5 groups of LEA proteins, and the ABI3 transcription factor is responsible for activating at least Group 4 LEA proteins, but Group 2 LEA proteins do not require ABI3 (6). Once again, the reduction of superfluous proteins will free up resources for other cell processes. The last part of the experiment will involve creating mutant Arabidopsis plants with dysfunctional CBFs, ABI1, and ABI3. This strain will lack any sort of protection against the cold or desiccation, so the water source and temperature will be carefully monitored (10). If the plants grow at least somewhat normally after blocking the cold and drought pathways, then it will be a good idea to further pursue methods to permanently block the unneeded responses of cold and desiccation protection in the plants with a high possibility of being sent to Mars. If the desiccation response is necessary, then it is very possible to enhance desiccation tolerance via genetic engineering or other biotechnological methods to increase production at low pressures. There are a lot more was to help plants cope with low pressures. For example, if the desiccation response and ABA is causing stomata to close, then it hinders the plant's ability to exchange gases like CO2, and photorespiration could occur. By blocking this response, perhaps the plants will have a more normal respiration rate. Also, investigation into the role of Heat Shock Proteins in hypobaric plants is another possible route. This project will serve as a model for future projects to engineer plants to thrive in hypobaric environments.

BIO.G1.01.1,V. Cholerae: First Steps towards a Spatially Explicit Model ,Biology,Proposal,"The recurrent cholera pandemics have been related with environmental variability and spatial heterogeneity. However, no spatially explicit model has been developed in order to consider such variations. The first step towards a spatially explicit model for cholera consists of the identification of the influence of processes and patterns at different spatial scales: micro (local), meso (intermediate) and macro (regional) scales. Analysis applying Point Pattern Analysis, Geostatistical and Epidemiological techniques are proposed in this work to perform such spatial characterization on cholera mortality data from the last 23 years in Matlab, Bangladesh. The world is still suffering the effects of the seventh cholera pandemic since 1961. This current pandemic originated in Indonesia with the first instance of an epidemic form of the strain known as El Tor, while the former six pandemics of cholera have been attributed to the Classical biotype (See Table 1). Hence, the challenge for epidemiologist nowadays is to have an epidemic-anticipatory-capability for the appearance of new strains and the reemergence and/or rapid geographic expansion of old strains. Because one of the most important goals of epidemiology is to avoid the occurrence of pandemics, revealing the processes leading the occurrence of outbreaks is critical. The recurrent epidemics of cholera present peculiar characteristics involving: Unfortunately, in spite of the advances in cholera research, a full characterization of its dynamics still remains distant. During the first cholera pandemic in 1817, the spread of cholera was believed to take place throughout the miasma (fog) coming from the rivers, showing some initial empirical findings in relation with water (Sack et al., 2004). Only in 1854, John Snow showed that contaminated water was the cause of cholera, and finally, during the epidemics in 1884 the causal agent was identified: the bacterium Vibrio cholerae (Colwell, 1996). Cholera is characterized by producing a profuse watery diarrhea, vomiting, circulatory collapse and shock (CDC, 2005). Such symptoms are usually manifested in a period ranging between 18 hours and 5 days of incubation, potentially in conjunction with an important liquid loss that may be close to one liter per hour (Sack et al., 2004). The treatment, basically, consists of a rehydration therapy, which may be complemented with appropriated antibiotic assistance, depending on whether complications occur. Cholera is considered a water-borne disease, although the bacterium may also be transmitted by contaminated food or a mixing of both, during (improper) cooking. Secondary infections (for example, during unhygienic funeral practices) rarely occur, and therefore, the pattern of water use is responsible for the dynamics of the epidemics (Sack et al., 2004). The causes for contamination of water sources are, however, not so clear. On the one hand, considering human beings as reservoirs positive feedback from infected individuals to water sources, introducing or maintaining the levels of cholera, may play a major role, leading to a strong correlation between patterns of mortality and human aggregation. On the other hand, if the bacterium life cycle is mainly controlled by environmental conditions, there might be a correlation with environmental variables or variability (Pascual et al., 2002; Rod� et al., 2002; Pascual et al., 2000). Previous research demonstrated some of the most intriguing characteristics of cholera. Early in 1925, Russell, questioned for the first time, whether a relationship between cholera and rainfalls exists. He found that the coefficient of correlation between cholera and rainfalls exhibited a maximum value in the northern districts of the former British-empire-province of Madras, whereas in southern districts the maximum value was reached when a delay of two months was introduced between both time series (with rainfall preceding cholera). Since then, more concrete analyses where performed studying the relationship between cholera and climate variables. The isolation of V. Cholerae from water samples at several locations in the late 1970's and early 1980's (Colwell et al., 1977; Colwell et al., 1981) motivated further works on identifying which ecological factors are strongly associated with the bacterium. The results of such analyses have showed that coastal algal blooms, which are strongly related with increases in sea surface temperature (SST), have acted as a trigger for cholera outbreaks (Colwell, 1996). More recently, Pascual et al. (2000), using nonlinear and nonparametric time-series techniques, confirmed a similar connection between cholera and climate in Dhaka, Bangladesh (between 1980 and 1998). More precisely, they found that cholera mortality is affected not only by extrinsic factors (El Ni�o-Southern Oscillation, ENSO, and climate variables, like upper-tropospheric humidity, cloud cover and top-of-atmosphere absorbed solar radiation), but also by intrinsic factors (i.e., previous levels of infection). Finally, their analyses also showed a latitudinal variation in the time lags between climate factors and cholera incidence in Bangladesh. Synchronization among ENSO, Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and cholera mortality has been successfully found/detected in Bengal (actually Bangladesh) exhibiting also a relation to the geographical distance from Bay of Bengal (Bouma and Pascual, 2001). Kwofie (1976) showed that the spread of cholera in western Africa presented two main components: a first component that followed the coastal line, and a second component with a complex behavior attributable to lagoons, rivers, and massive movement of people. Beside these findings, the spatial occurrence of cholera during the epidemic cycles with a detailed spatial scale remains unexplored. Colwell ,1996, however, has recognized the importance of incorporating into their analysis, natural water bodies, which potentially are playing both roles: reservoirs and sources. The prevention of pandemics requires on a better knowledge of the disease diffusion pattern. A better understanding of the transmission of cholera underlies the development of accurate mathematical models, which may be used in evaluation of possible scenarios. The first mathematical model developed by Capasso in 1979 (Torres Code�o, 2001) proposed only the dynamics of an infected population within a community together with an aquatic population of bacteria. This model was improved in 2001 (Torres Code�o, 2001), by including a third differential equation modeling: concentration of pathogen V. Cholerae in a water source, susceptible and infected individuals. With these three equations the emergence of cholera was analyzed and three possible outcomes were identified: (1) No outbreak, (2) an epidemic peak followed by extinction of the disease, and (3) an epidemic peak followed by subsequent outbreaks seasonally persisting. The numerical simulations exhibited a good fit with the actual cholera mortality data, but only for locations where a unique epidemic peak was present during the year. A third mathematical model was proposed by Pascual et al. (2002) adding a fourth equation. The variables under consideration were: number of susceptible individuals, infected individuals, bacteria abundance and water volume. The model hence, was able to capture the seasonality showed by cholera in several endemic zones. Furthermore, they have found that R0, the basic reproductive number that quantifies the number of new infections produced in a population of susceptible individuals by the first infected host individual, was sensitive to environmental variables that can vary not only during the year but also over long time scales. These findings envisioned a potential dual role of rainfall. On the one hand, short wet seasons favor environmental conditions for cholera leading to outbreaks. On the other hand, long wet seasons create a dilution effect avoiding the settlement of the bacterium in the environment, although outbreaks might still occur due to human aggregation. Analysis based on point pattern analysis techniques, considering cholera and rainfall time series from 1900 to 1940 in the Madras Presidency region agree with this double role of rainfall (Ruiz-Moreno et al., 2005). Although, the three mathematical models described above showed concordance between data and results, none of them is able to capture the dynamics of the infection at the level of villages because space is modeled implicitly. Therefore, the objective of this work is to perform the first steps in order to develop a spatially explicit model for V. cholerae, which might quantify the nature of the different ecological and climate processes involved during and between epidemic peaks. The incorporation of the spatial dimension in the analysis of ecological dynamics processes was clearly defined by Hanski (1999): Spatially explicit and spatially realistic approaches are used when it seems that the spatial locations of individuals in populations or local populations in metapopulations critically underpin the phenomena of interest. In this particular case, the metapopulation approach can help to understand the dynamic of cholera at different spatial scales (Anderson and May 1991, Grenfell and Harwood, 1997). The spatial scales proposed in this work will connect: a microscale (the spatial scale resulting from considering each host as an island to be colonized by the pathogen, Keeling et al. 2004), a mesoscale (the spatial scale determined by the aggregation of hosts into communities) and a macroscale (the regional spatial scale defined by set of communities, Keeling et al. 2004, and the connections among them). In conjunction with the characterization of the spatial scales, the dynamics of the disease also depends on a precise metapopulation description. The parameterization of a metapopulation model consist of estimation of: patch areas, including their spatial location; pairwise distances between them; presence and absence of the species under study; distribution of migrating distances; colonization ability and critical patch area. Each of these parameters may be mapped to epidemiological variables, in particular the critical patch area can be easily linked to the critical community size (Keeling, 1997). The patch areas, distances and distribution of migrating distances, however, are strongly dependent on the transmission of the disease, and the study of the spatial patterns formed during epidemics may provide empirical evidence to determine their realistic values. In order to find accurate parameter values for spatially explicit model for cholera dynamics, different methodological approach may be used including Point Pattern Analysis, Geostatistical Analysis, and determination of the Critical Community Size, among others. Point Pattern Analysis (PPA) and Geostatistical techniques provide enough power to characterize a spatial pattern (Weigand and Moloney, 2004; Rossi et al. 1992, Ripley, 1977). PPA techniques have been applied in previous research to discriminate among hypotheses on the processes that are responsible for the formation of the spatial diffusion pattern of a marine disease (Jolles et al., 2002), and also identifying patterns and spatial scales in systems formed by discrete units (Spooner et al., 2004; Oyana and Lwebuga-Mukasa, 2004; Kelly and Meentemeyer, 2002).Geostatistical tools are more adequate to model and evaluate diffusion patterns when a continuous process may be involved including not only space (Feng et al., 2004; Holdenrieder et al., 2004; Fortin et al., 2002; Unwin and Unwin, 1998; Legendre, 1993 ) but also time (Kuldorff et al. 2005; Odoi et al., 2003; Zhao et al., 2002; Ward and Carpenter, 2000; Knox and Bartlett, 1964). Therefore, the first step in order to characterize the diffusion of cholera proposed here consist of performing a complete exploratory spatial data analysis, which will provide an effective estimate of the degree of clustering of the epidemic and might be utilized to link the empirical cholera data with an accurate metapopulation diseases model. Further analyses will address the reliability of the metapopulation approach for the dataset available. The study of the cholera dynamics to identify spatial and temporal patterns, which might be seen in light of the metapopulation paradigm, will be based on recent historical records. The available dataset consists of mortality cholera data aggregated at the level of bari for the area of Matlab, Bangladesh over the last 23 years (Figure 1). The basic social unit in a village is the family (paribar or gushti), generally consisting of a complete or incomplete patrilineally (by descent through the male line) extended household (chula) and residing in a homestead (bari). For each bari geographic position, population and cholera mortality (including serotype and biotype) data from 1982 to 2004 are available. Climate information for the same period might be used to complement this dataset. With such degree of spatial detail, it will be possible to study the clustering of the disease following the ideas of Jolles and colleagues (2002). The dataset might present different degree of aggregation not only at the spatial scale but also at temporal scales. Therefore, this work will explore also the seasonality of cholera to verify previous findings, although new patterns could arise due to scalability properties (Pascual and Dobson, 2005; Sultan et al., 2005). Previous research provides enough insights to envision at least two hypotheses acting jointly and determining the dynamics of the epidemic: (a) when long rainfall periods occurred, when land availability is drastically reduced due to floods, the degree of aggregation of population may increase as well as direct or indirect human-to-human contagion, this mechanism may be acting during the monsoon season and hence high correlation between human aggregation and the aggregation of the disease is expected. The methodology proposed for analyze this case will measure the degree of aggregation at different spatial scales (Ripley, 1977) for both population and mortality. Bootstrap analyses could provide additional information in order to evaluate the likelihood of the spatial patterns. (b) on the other hand when short wet periods occurred the bacterium might be able to settle in the environmental producing massive infections, in such situation the spatial pattern of the infection might be coincident with the one of the environmental reservoirs and sources, in particular water ponds (Colwell, 1996). The same analysis proposed for the previous hypothesis could be used in this case, but additionally this hypothesis could be split into two cases: (b-1) If the reservoirs and sources of cholera are indeed the water ponds, which are widely distributed on the area of study, the pattern of emergence of epidemic waves should emerge from different sources, whereas (b-2) if the sources of infection are closely associated with major sources of water, i.e. rivers, the waves of epidemic could reflect some degree of directionality. Directionality could be evaluate by study how variability depends of space and direction, typically with directional semivariograms, but also quadrant methods could reveal places with high variability in the intensity of the infection process, which might be a indicator of such directionality (Bailey and Gatrell, 1995). Additionally, the information about serotype and biotype could be utilized in order to study whether strain cycles occurred during the period of study, or if some places exhibited preference for one particular strain, what might lead to a better classification of reservoirs and sources of infection. Such information combined with aggregation measures that include local variations (Anselin, 1995) could lead to the determination of not only endemic and epidemics zones (Ruiz-Moreno et al. 2005) but also to discriminate which strain could occur in each zone. The analyses proposed in this work will provide a better understanding of the dynamics of cholera in Matlab, Bangladesh. Combining the expected findings with previous works, it could be possible to elaborate a clear picture involving the regional climate variability, the local seasonality, the intrinsic dynamics of cholera and human population dynamics, enabling an evaluation of the importance of each factor. Sultan and colleagues (2005) have been able to develop an Early Warning Index in order to prevent the massive occurrence of Meningitis in western Africa, but it only characterize regional risk, however, the degree of detail in the case of cholera might even lead to the development of a similar index at different spatial scales providing a powerful tool to prevent the occurrence of epidemics not only in Matlab, but also be carefully extended and applied to other countries, such as India, Indonesia, Nigeria, Chad, Cameron, Senegal and Peru among other, where the fight against cholera is still a devastating reality. *Identification of water as a cause of Cholera **Discovery of Vibrio Cholerae Bacterium Table 1: Cholera Pandemics.

BIO.G1.07.1,Zebrafish and PGC mis-migration,Biology,Proposal,"There are two interesting phenomena in this research. (1)RTK is widely expressed in all embryonic tissues and throughout the entire embryogenesis; Since the gene doesn't express specifically, it's possible that the RTK will receive some signals from the environment (the growth factor), which lead to downstream expression of other genes in cells (PGCs or the surrounding somatic cells). And these downstream genes are essential for the migration of PGCs. Alternative explanation is that without such RTK, some types of cells cannot be formed, and indeed these somatic cells are important for the migration. (2)About 50% PGCs did not go to the right place; There are two possibilities. The first, only two groups of the totally four groups of the PGCs move to the right position, and the cells in the other two groups don't move to the right place (either begin to move but don't move to the right place, or don't move at all). The other possibility is only part of the PGCs move to the right place in any of the four groups, while other PGCs don't. Question: Do PGCs in two groups move to the right place? Or do part of the PGCs in the entire four groups move to the right place? We can synthesize an RNA encoding a fusion protein of zebrafish Vasa with GFP that also contains the vasa 3UTR (full-vasa-GFP), and then we can inject these RNAs into one-cell stage embryos (to the strain with a dominant negative construct of the RTK). After that, we can trace the movement of PGCs (from mid-gastrula stages, after the expression of GFP), and we can address the question about who doesn't move? (1)If we find that only two groups of PGCs move to the right place, it's most possibility that there is something wrong with the somatic cells. Because all of the four groups of PGCs should express almost the same genes, and it's difficult to explain why some of them can move while others cannot. But we dont know whether the problem comes from lost of certain ligands, or lost of certain type of cells. Then we can do experiment 2 to test. (2)If we find that in all the four group of PGCs there are some of the cells move to the right place, when others don't, it seems the movement signal is not strong enough. There are three possibilities. The first, the receptors on the PGSc, which is in charge of the movement of PGCs, don't express or are not enough. The second explanation is that the ligands, which can bind to the receptors on the face of PGSc don't express or not enough. The third one, is some type of somatic cells, which is very important for the migration, don't be generated. Then, we can do experiment 3 to distinguish the first explanation and the other two possibilities. If in the experiment 1 we get result (1), continue this experiment. Question: Is the migration defect due to the loss of a certain molecular that should express on the surface of some somatic cells, or due to the lost of certain types of somatic cells? (1)We should try to find the candidate somatic cells that may be the reason for migration defect according to the pattern and the region of these two disorder groups of PGCs' movement. (2)We can inject the cells from wild-type zebrafish to the embryo, to see whether we can rescue the individual, or to see whether some PGCs will move to the region with wild-type zebrafish cells; (3)We can select the candidate ligands that may be related to migration (from the information we have known, about the PGC migration in zebrafish and other species, similar to experiment 3 and 4); (4)Then, we can try to inject the mRNA coding ligand genes to the embryo of dnRTK individuals, and then do overexpression experiment, mopholino to confirm the results (similar to experiment 5) Imagine and analyze the results: (1)If we cannot rescue the defect by injecting the somatic cells, these somatic cells may be not the reason. We need to continue to find other reasons. (2)If we can rescue the defect by injecting the somatic cells, but we can't rescue the defect by injecting the certain gene's mRNA, maybe the RTK affect the formation of this type of the cells. (3)If we can rescue the defect by injecting the somatic cells, and we can rescue the defect by injecting the certain gene's mRNA, maybe the reason comes from the expression of this gene. If in the experiment 1 we get result (2), continue this experiment. Question: (1)Which are the receptors and ligands (that lead to the migration defect) been affected by dnRTK? (2)Is the migration defect from the receptors on the PGCs, or from the ligands on the surface of somatic cells? We have several candidates about the receptors and ligands that related to PGCs migration, such as CXCR4 and SDF1. And we can screen them by injecting RNA into the embryo (rescue), to see which pair is the reason for the defect. And also, we can get the information about whether the defect comes from receptors on PGCs or comes from ligands on somatic cells. (1)If we find the molecular for PGCs migration defect, we can decide whether the defect comes from PGCs or from somatic cells. If the defect is due to recepter, such as CXCR4, PGC mis-migration resides in PGCs themselves, and if the defect is due to ligand, such as SDF1, PGC mis-migration resides in the surrounding somatic cells. And we can do Experiment 5 to confirm the result. (2)If we cannot find the molecular that is reason for the migration defect. We should continue to find it in a larger extent of candidate genes (in experiment 4). If in the experiment 3 we get result (2), continue this experiment. Question: Are there some other genes can be the candidate receptors or ligands for experiment 3 to screen? (1)We can check the homologues that are related to cell migration in other species. (2)We can check the molecules expressing on the surface of the PGCs or the somatic cells closed to the target place. (3)Then we can return to experiment 3 Question: Are the molecules (receptors on the PGCs or the ligands on the somatic cells) really the reason for the defect? (1)We can use RNAi (mopholino) technique to knock down the expression of certain genes, to see whether they have a similar phenotype to the dnRTK strain. (2)We can use overexpression technique to see whether too much expression will lead to disorder of the PGC migration. (3)We can inject some cells express the molecules that we think are related to migration defect, to see whether the molecular is the reason for the migration. (For example, if we inject some wild-type somatic cells related, we expect PGCs should move to the region with wild-type somatic cells located.) (1)If we can get the result as expect, the result should be a solid one; (2)If not, we can try to find some other factors that affect the migration.

BIO.G2.06.1,A Conserved Role of Cas-Spg System in Endoderm Specification during Early Vertebrate Development,Biology,Proposal,"How multipotent early embryonic cells differentiate into endodermal lineage remains elusive. Although a group of transcription factors are implicated in endoderm development, how they work together to induce endoderm differentiation is largely unknown. In zebrafish, Spg, a POU domain transcription factor, acts with Cas, a prospective endodermal HMG domain transcription factor induced by Nodal (TGF-beta superfamily) signaling, to activate endoderm development through activation of endoderm specific genes such as sox17(Reim et al., 2004). In mice, chimeric study showed that Smad2-mediated TGF-beta signaling(Tremblay et al., 2000) and Sox17(Kanai-Azuma et al., 2002) are also required for the initial specification of the endoderm. Oct4, mice orthology of zebrafish spg, controls lineage commitment in a dose-dependent manner: an increase in expression causes differentiation into primitive endoderm and mesoderm, while downregulation induces dedifferentiation to trophectoderm(Niwa et al., 2000). POU and SOX(SRY-related HMG) transcription factors have been suggested to exemplify their functional partnership through combinational binding onto Sox-Oct enhancer element(Remenyi et al., 2003). Whether there exits a functional cas homolog in mice that acts with Oct4 to induce endoderm differentiation awaits investigation. Research in our lab using ES cell line stably transfected with nkx2.5(cardiac-specific transcription factor) promoter:GFP reporter construct and sox17(endoderm specific transcription factor) promoter:CFP reporter construct showed that upon Nodal treatment, Oct4 mRNA and protein expression levels are transiently upregulated(24hr and 48 hr but not after); Sox7 mRNA level can hardly be detected before Nodal induction, but started to express at 24hr till 96hr post Nodal treatment; Expression of both reporter genes can be observed in a portion(>20% each) of the differentiated ES cells(96hr). In an attempt to identify transcription factors that play essential role in endoderm formation, we initiated an siRNA screening using a series of short interfering RNA expression vectors targeted to various transcription factors and transfected them into the ES cell line. Among the transcription factors tested, Sox7 siRNA suppressed the sox17:CFP expression without significantly affecting nkx2.5:GFP expression. Immunostaining of the ES cells upon Nodal treatment(24 and 48hr) showed that Sox7 colocalize in the nuclei of a portion of the ES cells with Oct4 staining. Immunostaining of the mice blastocyst section further confimed that Sox7 colocalizes in the nuclei of a portion of the cells expressing Oct4 in the ICM. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments performed in Nodal induced ES cells(48hr) suggests that Oct4 and Sox7 associate in the same complex. Based on the clue from the zebrafish cas-spg system and our preliminary data in mice, we hypothesize that Sox7 acts with Oct4 to induce endoderm differentiation in mice early embryonic development. To test the hypothesis, we propose the following specific aims: Oct4 protein is abundant in the ICM of early blastocysts and downregulated in trophectoderm, while even more highly expressed in nascent primitive endoderm(Palmieri et al., 1994). Our preliminary data suggested that Nodal induced mesoendoderm differentiation correlated with Oct4 upregulation. And siRNA knowdown of sox7 repressed the endodermal fate, suggesting that Sox7 is necessary in this lineage specification. However, it is not clear whether Oct4 upregulation is required for endoderm differentiation or merely for mesoderm differentiation. Also, it is not clear whether loss of Sox7 affects endodermal specification in vivo. To test if transient Oct4 upregulation is required for endoderm differentiation, siRNA or antisense cDNA mediated Oct4 knockdown will be performed in Nodal induced ES cells expressing nkx2.5 promoter:GFP and sox17 promoter:CFP. Knockdown efficiency will be verified by qPCR and Western blotting. Empty vector transfected cells will serve as control. GFP and CFP signals will be monitored by fluorescent microscopy and quantified by flow cytometry. Other markers for endoderm and mesoderm specific genes will also be tested by qPCR. To examine if loss of Sox7 affects endodermal specification in vivo, we will generate sox7-/- ES cells carrying reporter transgene sox17 promoter:CFP and inject it into blastocyst to create chimera mice. Wildtype ES cells with the same reporter gene will serve as control. Oct4 knockdown level should be adjusted so that there will be similar level of Oct4 expression as is before Nodal induction. Loss of nkx2.5:GFP expression will also serve as control, since transcient Oct4 upregulation has been suggested to be required for cardiac gene expression. If sox17:CFP expression is also repressed, it suggested that transcient Oct4 upregulation is required for endoderm specific gene expression. However, if the expression of reporter gene is not downregulated, it suggests that sox17 is regulated through another pathway independent of Oct4. We will further look at expression of other endoderm markers to see if they are related to transcient Oct4 upregulation. If none of them are affected, it suggests that that transcient Oct4 upregulation is not required for endoderm specification. If some of the markers are even upregulated, it is also interesting, suggesting that Oct4 plays a role in differentiating mesoderm and endoderm. For the sox7-/-/sox17:CFP donor and sox7+/+ recipient chimera mice, we expect to see the loss of sox17:CFP reporter expression and loss of endoderm germ layer compared with the control, suggesting Sox7 is required for endoderm specific gene expression and endoderm formation. If the sox17:CFP reporter expression is too low in the wildtype control, we will alternatively use siRNA of sox7 to inject into blastocysts and reimplant into pseudopregnant mice to see if endoderm development will be affected. If we can also observe GFP expressing in the sox7-/- doner chimera mice, it suggests that sox17 can be activated through other pathways in vivo, probably independent of Nodal signaling. We may further test this possibility by using Nodal antagonists. It has been suggested that misexpressiong of cas can ectopically elicit endoderm differentiation in an spg background but cannot do so without spg. It would be interesting to test whether ectopic expression or forced overexpression of Sox7 will induce endoderm specification and whether that is Oct4 dependent. To test if upregulation of Sox7 with Oct4 can induce endoderm specific gene expression, we will use Tetracyline(Tc) inducible transgene of Sox7. We will withdraw Tc upon Nodal induction to co-activate Sox7 expression. Non Nodal treated cells and non Tc withdrawn cells will serve as control. Since the function of a given transcription factor might be dose-dependent, the Sox7 transgene expressing level in non Nodal induced Tc withdrawn cells be adjusted comparable to the Sox7 expression level in Nodal induced non Tc withdrawn cells. Then the same condition of Tc withdrawn will be applied to Nodal induced cells and see if Sox7 transgenic cells show higher level of sox17:GFP reporter gene expression compared with the non Tc withdrawn cells. If sox7 transgene upregulation and Nodal induction promotes endoderm specific gene expression compared with Nodal induction alone, it suggests that Sox7 and Oct4 are sufficient for endoderm specification. If sox7 transgene upregulation alone, without Nodal induction can drive endoderm specific gene expression, it suggested that sox7 acts downstream or independent of Oct4 for endoderm specification. To further test if Sox7 can induce endoderm formation in vivo, ES cells overexpressing Sox7 will be transplanted into mice ICM or trophectoderm and do lineage tracing of the transplanted cells to see if they can ectopically express endoderm marker. In zebrafish, Spg and Cas has been shown to be able to synergistically activate sox17 promoter. Immunostaining of the mice ES cells and blastocyst suggested colocalization of Oct4 and Sox7. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments suggests that Oct4 and Sox7 associate in the same complex in vivo. However, it is not clear whether these two proteins interact through direct binding, if they form a complex that binds DNA and whether sox17 promoter is one of their shared target. GST-pull down will be performed using purified GST-Oct4 and HA-Sox7 to test they can interact directly in vitro. EMSA assay using Myc-Oct4 and HA-Sox7 affinity purified from transfected cell culture will be performed to test if they can cause the mobility shift of the DNA containing Octamer and Sox elements. The specificity of the binding will be confirmed by supershift analyses with anti-Myc and anti-HA antibodies. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay using Oct4 and Sox7 antibody in ES cells 48hr after Nodal treatment will be performed to see if they co-occupy the endoderm specific gene promoter such as sox17. If GST-Oct4 can pull down HA-Sox7, it suggested direct interaction between the two proteins. Further mutation of the POU and HMG domain will test whether the interaction is via these domains. If we observe mobility shift in Myc-Oct4 and HA-Sox7, it suggests the binding of the two factors to DNA. We can further mutate the consensus Oct or Sox binding site to see if it will restore the mobility shift. If the purified protein cannot cause the mobility shift, it is possible that the binding requires other partners. To test this we will add ES cell lysates and see if it helps in the mobility shift. To better test the binding of the two factors to DNA in vivo, ChIP assay will be performed to test if they co-occupy the endogenous gene promoter. Sox17 promoter and other known endoderm specific gene promoters will be candidate target DNA. Furthermore, ChIP on Chip analysis will be performed in Nodal induced ES cells and see how the two transcription factors localize to the genomic region. Our preliminary data suggests that Oct4 is transiently upregulated and then turned down during mesoendoderm differentiation, while Sox7 is turned on. Although in zebrafish, Spg and Cas seem to cooperate in activation of sox17 expression, it is unclear if in mice early embryonic development, these two factors cooperate with each other in transcriptional activation of endoderm specific gene expression, or one may repress the activity or expression of another. Co-transfect oct4 and/or sox7 with sox17 promoter driven luciferase reporter DNA into mice ES cells to see if they can synergistically activate the endoderm specific gene promoter. Furthermore, test the luciferase reporter activitity using Oct4 and Sox7 promoter. If both Sox7 and Oct4 are required to activate sox17:GFP expression, it suggests that these two factors act synergistically. If Sox7 alone activates sox17:GFP expression, which will be repressed with Oct4 co-expressed, it suggests that Oct4 acts as an co-repressor for the endoderm specific gene expression. Further experiment using ChIP assay to test Sox7 or Oct4 localization on the endogenous sox17 promoter may be performed at different time points to test if Oct4 recruits Sox7 to the target promoter but later on gets off the promoter, which allows target gene activation by Sox7. Also, testing the Sox7 and Oct4 transcriptional activity on Oct4 and Sox7 promoter will allow us to investigate the possible feedback loop between the two factors. It is our belief that investigating the conserved role of zebrafish cas-spg system in mice will not only give insight into the evolution of early embryonic development but also have therapeutic implication as to coax stem cells to form endodermal tissue, a likely prerequisite to forming endodermal organs de novo.

BIO.G3.02.1,Linking scales to understand diversity,Biology,Proposal,"At root, every hypothesis is a claim about the relevance of particular scales. If the hypothesis is parsimonious, and if the phenomenon it attempts to explain is simple, most scales are irrelevant. The classic SIR model (Kermack and McKendrick 1927) is impressive because it captures the dynamics of many infectious diseases with just a few interactions. Hosts are well-mixed particles in three possible compartments whose contact rates vary as simple linear or nonlinear functions of their populations. The model omits processes on other temporal scales, such as feedback with the physical environment and evolution by the pathogen and the host. It also omits spatial scales, such as competition among pathogens within a host and differences in contact rates due to population structure. These assumptions work well for particular systems [e.g., Grenfell et al. (1992), cf. Swinton et al. (1998)], and are the foundation of other popular models in ecology [e.g., Volterra (1926)]. By nature of their simplicity, all their potential behaviors can be predicted analytically. However, many interesting phenomena are not well explained by these assumptions. Mean-field models can poorly approximate sexually transmitted diseases (Eames and Keeling 2002) and mechanisms of disease emergence, which may depend on the effects of superspreaders (Lloyd-Smith et al. 2005). In other systems, endogenous dynamics are strongly affected by extrinsic climatic forcing (Koelle and Pascual 2004) or interactions with other populations (LoGiudice et al. 2003; Jensen et al. 2006). In fast-evolving RNA viruses, such as HIV, strong selection within individual hosts and the timing of transmission may affect the frequency of CTL escape and CXCR4 mutants in the host population (Rambaut et al. 2004). Local interactions, biotic and abiotic extrinsic drivers, and rapid evolution are examples of spatial, organizational, or temporal scales that crucially augment or replace the null dynamical model (Pascual 2005). Often these complexities can be incorporated into standard models by adding parameters, such as modified mixing terms (Roy and Pascual 2006). If the modifications do not produce the observed behavior, they may need to be replaced by a more accurate description of the underlying process, e.g., a contact network or agent-based simulation. One of the goals in researching these systems is to address the importance of variability at small, local scales to the dynamics of aggregated quantities measured at large, global scales. If small-scale 'details' matter, we need to ask how much complexity we need to incorporate into large-scale models if we seek to both understand and predict the dynamics of global quantities (Pascual 2005). I would add that these details do not have to be small, since we are not always studying global quantities. We may also ask whether patterns are shaped by extrinsic factors or dynamicsperhaps it matters that the system is open. The best hypotheses of complex systems remain parsimonious while appealing to processes occurring on other spatial, temporal, or organizational scales to describe a pattern. They are consequently challenging to evaluate, since there are so many possible processes (and thus competing hypotheses) to choose from. I would like to use this framework to determine what does and does not regulate the diversity of a common but poorly understood disease, influenza. I define diversity as the variation in genotype and phenotype at any one time and how this variation changes over time: It encapsulates a broad set of ecological and evolutionary patterns resulting from the interaction of few or many scales. I follow the lead of recent exceptional models that have relaxed common assumptions about which scales are relevant and thereby made contributions to our understanding of flu. The following section presents biological contextthat is, the mechanisms I suspect underpin broad patterns in flu diversityfor the research questions that follow. The genome of influenza A consists of eight RNA segments, each 850 to 2300 bases long, which code for 10 proteins (Table 1). Two of these proteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) are abundant on the viruss surface, with approximately 4 HA for every NA. There are sixteen forms of HA and nine forms of NA. Combinations of HA and NA form subtypes, e.g., H3N2. Amino acid sequences of HA differ up to 20% within subtypes and 30-70% between them (Skehel and Wiley 2000). Hemagglutinin and neuraminidase are the primary determinants of antigenicity. Antibody-binding sites of some subtypes of HA and NA have been described by X-ray crystallography and electron micrographs of monoclonal antibody escape mutants (Bizebard et al. 1995; Fleury et al. 1999; Knossow et al. 2002). These sites are grouped into antibody-binding regions, or epitopes, on the globular head of hemagglutinin (HA1). HA1 of the H3N2 subtype infecting humans has four or five epitopes, labeled A-E (Figure 1a) [epitope D may only be recognized by murine antibodies (Sato et al. 2000)]. HA1 of the H1N1 subtype has four or five recognized epitopes (Caton et al. 1982) (Gerhard et al. 1981), and the N2 NA has at least two (Gulati et al. 2002). Different subtypes of HA1 can have the same epitopes (Smirnov et al. 1999). Antibodies neutralize influenza viruses through steric inhibition of receptor binding or membrane fusion, rather than inducing conformational change in HA. The receptor-binding site is a highly conserved pocket at the top of the HA1 (in H3N2, the site falls near epitopes A and B) and shows little variation among subtypes (Skehel and Wiley 2000). Antibodies can neutralize viruses by blocking the receptor-binding site directly (Bizebard et al. 1995) or by binding to an epitope some distance away (Fleury et al. 1999) (Figure 1b); the latter mechanism can block receptor binding or interfere with membrane fusion. Antibodies to the same epitope can compete or interact synergistically in neutralization (Brown et al. 1990; Sanna et al. 2000). Antibody affinity is positively but loosely correlated with neutralization ability (Kostolansky et al. 2000). One study found that on average one quarter of the hemagglutinins on the viral surface had to be neutralized to prevent infection (Knossow et al. 2002). The three neutralizing antibodies they investigated all interfered with receptor binding rather than membrane fusion. Neutralization kinetics have been described as log-linear or pseudo-first-order [reviewed in Frank (2002)]. Hosts resist infection through humoral immunity, cellular immunity, and serum inhibitors. The contribution of each kind of immunity is a very active area of research, and contributions differ among host species. Humoral immunity is the basis of permanent strain-specific immunity and some cross-immunity within subtypes in mammals; it also may play a role in heterosubtypic immunity. The specificity of antibodies is gauged by the ability of sera to inhibit hemagglutination by viruses of a particular strain. Most antibodies in sera of infected or vaccinated humans target HA1 (Sato et al. 2004), though some individuals also mount responses to NA (Cox and Brokstad 1999). All mammals investigated demonstrate antibodies to NP (Deboer et al. 1990; Cox and Brokstad 1999). Antibody repertoire can be monoclonal (antibodies to one epitope are present in antisera) or polyclonal (antibodies to multiple epitopes are present). Children have narrower antibody repertoires than adults: 25 of 27 children under age twelve developed antibodies to a region of epitope B of H3N2 HA1, and six showed antibodies for sites A or C. In contrast, older subjects had polyclonal responses to epitopes A, B, C, and E (Sato et al. 2004). Cellular immunity can significantly abrogate pathology and speed viral clearance, though it appears to play a lesser role in preventing infection [Liang et al. (1994) and review in Thomas et al. (2006)]. T cells only attack presenting cells, and thus they usually lag behind antibodies in appearance and proliferation during infection. Mice challenged with a virus containing the internal proteins of human H1N1 produce CD8+ T cells specific to all six internal proteins, though T cells specific to epitopes on PA and NP predominate and can be detected e570 days after initial infection. Secondary responses tend to be dominated by NP (Belz et al. 2000; Marshall et al. 2001). CD4+ T cells bolster CD8+ and B cell responses and appear requisite for T cell memory (Belz et al. 2002). Studies of humans generally cannot separate the effects of cellular immunity from humoral and are unhelpful in gauging protection conferred by the former. They do, however, confirm that (1) there is no evidence that cellular immunity prevents infection, except possibly when exposures are simultaneous; and (2) there is a marked attenuation of symptoms during secondary infections. One small study observed several cases of rapid reinfections with heterologous subtypes, sometimes within days of clearance of the first subtype, and the secondary infection was no more likely to be asymptomatic than the first (Frank et al. 1983); in contrast, students at high schools experiencing concurrent epidemics of H3N2 and H1N1 were less likely to suffer multiple infections than students at schools with sequential epidemics (Sonoguchi et al. 1986). Attenuation of symptoms during secondary infections has also been demonstrated during pandemics of H2N2 and H3N2 (Sonoguchi et al. 1985). However, in both cases the HA of the pandemic strain were rapidly evolving (Matrosovich et al. 2000), and similar patterns are produced by antibody-mediated cross-immunity (Gill and Murphy 1977). Comparatively little is known about the immunologic effects of serum inhibitors, which can select variants with altered receptor binding sites and may play a role in host range (Rogers et al. 1983; Matrosovich et al. 1998). Influenza viruses evolve by point mutations, reassortment of whole gene segments, and rarely by recombination (Hirst et al. 2004; Suarez et al. 2004). Point mutations are the most frequent means of escaping immune surveillance, and they are also a means to modulate virulence, develop drug resistance, and adapt to new hosts or tissue types. Monoclonal antibody escape mutants arise in vitro every 104 to 106 viruses (Webster and Laver 1980). They avoid recognition by conformational changes or additional glycosylation sites that block antibody binding. Conformational changes tend to affect only the local structure within the surrounding epitope (Knossow et al. 1984). Hemagglutinin may be particularly tolerant of such changes: epitope A mostly consists of a loop extending from the rest of the molecule, and epitopes B and C are bulges (Wiley et al. 1981). While amino acids at certain positions, such as loops, will have a dramatically greater influence than others on antibody recognition, the location of influential positions can change over time (Nakajima et al. 2005). As for other pathogens, tertiary protein structure greatly complicates predictions of the locations of B cell epitopes (Korber et al. 2006). Influenza viruses can also escape immune surveillance through the addition of glycosylation sites [Asn-X-Thr/Ser, where X is any amino acid except proline or potentially aspartic acid (Gallagher et al. 1992)]. Host cell carbohydrates binding to these sites form a glycan shield to antibodies. Glycosylation is the major mechanism of antibody escape by HIV (Wei et al. 2003) and predicts the strength of the antibody repertoire mounted by Rhesus monkeys to SIV (Reitter et al. 1998). The number of potential glycosylation sites on HA1 of H3N2 has increased from two to six or seven since the subtype emerged in humans (Abe et al. 2004). While increased glycosylation decreases receptor binding activity in vitro, it can do so without negatively affecting cell fusion. Glycosylation may thus be an especially rapid effecter of antigenic change (Schulze 1997), though it is not well tolerated by all subtypes of HA (Tsuchiya et al. 2002). The accumulation of point mutations in response to immune pressure has previously been called antigenic drift, and it underlies the characteristic phylogeny of HA1 in human viruses: genetic distance steadily increases from the founding strain, and no strain persists more than a few years (Figure 2a). Recently it has been shown that these strains in human H3N2 form antigenic clusters defined by cross-reactivity patterns (Figure 2b). Only one cluster appears to dominate at any time (Smith et al. 2004). In contrast to antigenic drift, antigenic shift by reassortment was once thought to be rare and to always cause pandemics (Webster et al. 1992). There is growing evidence that reassortment is as common in humans (Lindstrom et al. 2004; Holmes et al. 2005) as in other hosts (Hatchette et al. 2004; Webby et al. 2004). It may lead to partial immune escape by shuffling combinations of HA, NA, and other antigenic determinants. One antigenic cluster (FU02) may have arisen through reassortment (Holmes et al. 2005), potentially without antigenically significant changes in HA1. Unlike introductions of H1N1, H2N2, and H3N2 into the human population, the emergence of the H1N2 subtype since 2001-2002 has not obviously increased incidence. Influenza is highly seasonal in temperate regions, with a four-month epidemic period in winter and few cases in the summer (Figure 3a) (Cox and Subbarao 2000). Incidence shows no clear periodicity in the tropics (Figure 3b) (Chow et al. 2006; Viboud et al. 2006a). Pandemic and interpandemic influenza A strains circulate globally over short time periods. H3N2 outbreaks have especially high spatial synchrony (Greene et al. 2006; Viboud et al. 2006b), and phylogenetic studies of strains circulating in France (Lavenu et al. 2006), Japan (Nakajima et al. 1991), and New York (Nelson et al. Submitted) demonstrate that multiple lineages seed annual epidemics in each community. Swabs from air travelers support the hypothesis that there is interhemispheric transport of strains throughout the year (Sato et al. 2000). Incidence is usually inferred from deaths to pneumonia and influenza. Until recently, few countries tracked deaths or infections by type and subtype. Observations from WHO collaborating labs reporting to the CDC suggest that seasons dominated by H3N2 have relatively low incidence of H1N1 and influenza B and vice-versa (Figure 3c) (Thompson et al. 2003; Greene et al. 2006). Estimates of annual incidence range from 10-20% in interpandemic years and 40-50% during pandemics (Cox and Subbarao 2000), but there does not seem to be much confidence in any value in the flu community. Contact with young children is a significant risk factor for infection (Gubareva et al. 2002; Viboud et al. 2004), and vaccination of young children can dramatically reduce incidence in older contact children and adults (Monto et al. 1970; Hurwitz et al. 2000). Many other species can be infected with influenza viruses, and multiple subtypes are endemic in swine, domestic poultry, and horses. Influenza is seasonal in many aquatic birds, which are its natural hosts. Transmission between wild birds and domestic poultry, wild birds and swine, domestic poultry and humans, and swine and humans occurs at least annually in many parts of the developed and developing world where the populations cohabitate (section 5, below). Most models of influenza have focused on explaining seasonal dynamics of flu in (temperate latitude) human populations and mechanisms of strain cycling (Pease 1987; Andreasen et al. 1997; Lin et al. 1999; Andreasen 2003; Boni et al. 2004; Dushoff et al. 2004; Lavenu et al. 2004). They assume population immunity declines as a function of antigenic drift, which itself can occur at a constant rate or as a function of epidemic size, and that cross-immunity between serotypes is fixed. Regular and irregular oscillations in incidence, dynamical resonance, and complex strain cycling can result under these assumptions. A few studies have explored strain structure with evolution. Boni et al. (2006) predicted that strong host immunity and long epidemics would lead to the highest rates of antigenic drift. They proposed that their model could explain anecdotal reports that antigenic variants tend to arise toward the end of a season, with attack rates rising the following year. Gog et al. (2003) demonstrated that a slight increase in the duration of infectiousness can substantially increase the survival probability of a mutant strain during seasonal bottlenecks in transmission. They suggested that this mechanism may have accounted for the rapid fixation of CTL escape mutants in the 1993-1994 season. Three models have attempted to describe broader patterns by coupling dynamics of strain evolution to population dynamics. Gog and Grenfell (2002) showed that strains evolving in one-dimensional evolutionary space form clusters if infection times are short and cross-immunity is high. They noted that the existence of clusters could yield phylogenies with short branches, but, like previous studies, they did not attempt to match their systems endogenous dynamics to empirically observed seasonality. To explain strain evolution, subtype cycling, and seasonal dynamics in tandem, Ferguson et al. (2003) constructed an agent-based model that could generate HA trees with short side branches, annual fluctuations in incidence, and subtype replacement and coexistence. Central to their model was a strain-transcendent, generalized immunity (attributed to cellular immunity) that reduced the probability of infection in a density-dependent way; they found this immunity required a half-life of six months to restrict diversity sufficiently. They also incorporated spatial structure, something akin to original antigenic sin (exposure would boost immunity to old strains even if hosts were not infected), and a 30-year host lifetime. It is unclear how robust their results are to these assumptions. Ferguson and coauthors showed that the interaction of ecological dynamics, immune selection, and evolutionary dynamics on comparable time scales might be critical for influenza. The third and most recent model elaborates another scale of complexity, rather than invoking generalized immunity, to explain influenza evolution and seasonality. Koelle et al. (in prep) infer from the existence of antigenic clusters that large spaces of genotype space are effectively neutral, since they have the same antigenic phenotype, and that this relationship arises from the nature of the genotype-phenotype mapping and not the infection history of the strain (Figure 4a). We propose that interpandemic influenza undergoes epochal evolution. During periods of apparent evolutionary stasis, strains diffuse through genotype space. A mutant that discovers a new phenotype (cluster) encounters fewer immune hosts and proliferates. Partial cross-immunity to the old cluster causes the old cluster to rapidly go extinct. The model predicts and confirms that real influenza strains undergo a boom-and-bust cycle of genetic diversity. The model further proposesand requiresthat genotype space within clusters is almost neutral. Without weak positive selection, simulated strains explore genotype space too slowly to generate the characteristic increases (Figure 4b). I am not aware of any ecological and evolutionary models of influenza in other host species, despite recent dramatic changes in host ecology and viral diversity. One of the most important ends of understanding biological systems, and diseases in particular, is predictionincluding the knowledge that a system might be too stochastic or chaotic to predict reliably. Our management strategy for influenza is still largely reactive; next seasons vaccine is based on the most antigenically divergent strains of the current one, and until recently, only populations most at risk of dying from infection were targeted for vaccination [2006-2007 is the first season for which the CDC has recommended vaccinating children 6-59 months old (Smith et al. 2006)]. Influenza is furthermore an exciting system because of the convergence of so many possible dynamical scales: due to their high mutation rates and short generation times, RNA viruses are especially sensitive to changes in host ecology. It is increasingly evident that the relevant ecologies are both those encountered within hosts and in host populations, manifested as adaptive immune responses (Grenfell et al. 2004). We are in a position to affect host ecology, and thus viral evolution, through vaccination, antivirals, and farming practices. My goal is to examine linkages between viral evolution on a molecular level and immunity on molecular and population levels to identify factors involved in regulating flu diversity in humans and other species. My first three research projects investigate the roles of humoral and cellular immunity in flu evolution and strain competition. The next two projects consider the effects of other aspects of host ecologies on viral evolution. The last project explores the adaptive potential of influenza under different modes of evolution. My specific questions are: There are two hypotheses of how influenza undergoes continual antigenic drift while its genetic diversity remains bounded over time. Ferguson, Galvani, and Bush (2003) and Tria et al. (2005) contend that density-dependent, generalized immunity is necessary to restrict diversity. Each group invokes another factorheterogeneity in host transmission (spatial structure) and variable strain fitness, respectivelythat crucially augments the effect of generalized immunity. Koelle et al. (in prep) propose that diversity is constrained episodically by the appearance of new antigenic phenotypes that competitively displace existing strains. Selective sweeps by antigenic variants have been proposed before for H3N2 (Fitch et al. 1991) and H1N1 (Ina and Gojobori 1994). The model of Koelle and coauthors suggests that the novel phenotypes correspond to the eleven clusters of H3N2 between 1968 and 1998. Cohort studies of reinfection in humans indicate that cross-immunity is as high as 95% within clusters and 60-84% between clusters (Gill and Murphy 1977). The model also proposes that in addition to abrupt, intense sweeps, there is weak selection within clusters. A strain begins in a neutral network, i.e., genotype set corresponding to the same phenotype or cluster, and diffuses through high-dimensional genotype space via mutations until it arrives at a node (sequence) belonging to an adjacent network. With some probability, this adjacent network is a continuous (slight) or discontinuous (major) phenotypic change, with respectively a modest (i5%) or substantial (520%) decrease in cross-immunity. Discontinuous changes curtail diversity by precipitating cluster transitions; continuous changes increase diversity by causing accelerated diffusion from the cluster's founding strain. The effects of accelerated diffusion in genotype space may be visible in the phylogenetic trees of some clusters (Figure 4a). For example, in BE89 and BE92, multiple lineages persist from one year to the next, suggestive of neutral diffusion. The trees of WU95 and SY97, in contrast, generally have unidirectional growth, which echoes the traditional descriptions of the HA1 trees as a whole. This pattern could be due to chance, perhaps in sampling or off-season extinction, or due to positive selection on some branches. There are several reasons why it may be useful to evaluate the strength and location of positive selection in influenza over time. The first is that there is clearly some threshold where selection ceases to augment diversity and instead reduces it. The second is that selection, as suggested above, may allow prediction of which strains will dominate from year to year within a cluster. Before the clusters were identified, Bush et al. (1999b; 1999a) found that the number of amino acid replacements of 18 codons, most located on two epitopes of HA1, could retrospectively predict the lineages that would survive from one year to the next. They applied their technique to eleven years; interestingly, their rule does most poorly in years in which cluster transitions probably occurred. This raises the interesting possibility that not only the strength but also the targets of selection within clusters may differ from that between clusters. Further, there is evidence suggesting the possibility of strong selection on NA (Venkatramani et al. 2006). Is this selection reflected in the tree of HA? Is there any temporal correlation in selection on the two proteins? Which epitopes on each protein are targeted? Recognition of these patterns could lead to better predictive models and more sophisticated vaccines. Selection within clusters may also be a nontrivial component of influenza's evolutionary and ecological dynamics. A strictly neutral network model presents a paradox. If the supply of susceptibles diminishes as strains diffuse through genotype space, it would be possible for the virus to go extinct before finding a new phenotype. This has not yet happened for H3N2. Are the discontinuous phenotypes frequent enough to exclude this possibility, or might positive selection within networks critically accelerate diffusion, and thus increase the probability of finding significantly new phenotypes (K. Koelle, pers. comm.)? The first chapter of my thesis will describe the strength and targets of selection in HA and NA of H3N2 over time. The null model, strict within-cluster neutrality, can be associated with three different patterns: I do not see a simple method for statistically evaluating the first prediction, though simulation may yield insight. My research will thus focus on the latter two predictions. Using the 253 sequences antigenically typed by Smith et al. (2004), I have so far calculated dN and dS differences and ratios for groups of codons suggested in the literature of positive selection. Preliminary results suggest that there is weak positive selection on at least one epitope of HA1 in every cluster and strong selection between them. Selection on epitopes A, B, and E is most often associated with cluster transitions (Figure 5). Epitope B has the greatest contrast in the strength of selection within clusters versus between them, suggesting it has greater antigenic potential than other epitopes. Epitopes C and D demonstrate fluctuating selection, e.g., there is no positive selection on epitope D after the 1970s. The strength of selection on epitopes within clusters does not appear predictive of the epitopes that are most strongly selected between clusters. Future analysis will refine these measures. In particular, I will consider methods for detecting selection at single sites and in quasispecies (Stewart et al. 2001); methods that estimate the physicochemical effects of substitutions (Wong et al. 2006); and methods that consider selection in sites that are structurally close (Suzuki 2004). I will also broaden the analysis by searching over the entire HA1 and available NA sequences. This work will be complemented by analysis of lineage survival, broadening the picture by Bush et al. (1999a). They report a 40% excess of amino acid substitutions on terminal branches, though the number of replacements at 18 positively selected codons was associated with lineage survival. It is telling that their rule of fast evolution, which predicts that the successful lineage has the greatest numbers of replacements at the 20 fastest-evolving codons (12 of which were under positive selection), performs best in the putative cluster transitions: accumulation of random changes in bulk may be more likely to lead to discontinuous transitions than selection at a few sites, perhaps because of the unpredictable effects of different residues on tertiary structure. Their work shows that it will be important to consider changes in individual codons, the locations of changes, and the number of changes for each branch. To reevaluate their results and test my third hypothesis, I will thus build and compare trees with codon-based maximum likelihood and Bayesian substitution models, using relaxed clocks where possible (Drummond et al. 2006). More complex models become computationally tractable if trees are built of just a few clusters at a time. I will then evaluate models of positive selection using maximum likelihood and Bayesian approaches on the trees (Yang 1997; Ronquist and Huelsenbeck 2003; Kosakovsky Pond and Frost 2005; Kosakovsky Pond et al. 2005). In my analysis of selection over time, I will also consider where the addition of glycosylation sites might have affected strain fitness by removing epitopes from antibody pressure (for example, at site D). I will also try to distinguish sites under T cell selection from those under antibody selection, using discovered (Rimmelzwaan et al. 2004; Berkhoff et al. 2005) and predicted (Korber et al. 2006) T cell epitopes. Models of strain competition usually assume that cross-immunity between strains is invariant: all hosts infected with one strain have the same probability of being infected with another. Cross-immunity under this assumption can yield complex dynamics determined by the intensity of competition. Gupta et al. (1998) showed that for realistic ratios of infection times and host lifespans, cross-immunity could move the system through three different dynamical regimes (Figure 6). Intense strain competition led to the dominance of one antigenically nonoverlapping set; at intermediate competition, strains cycled periodically or chaotically; and when cross-immunity was low, strain structure disappeared. Koelle et al. (in prep) also assume that the cross-immunity between strains is fixed. Strains within a cluster have almost complete cross-immunity, but their high mutation rate allows genetic and transient antigenic diversification. Slightly lower cross-immunity between clusters causes competitive exclusion by ensuring large fitness differences between serotypes. Thus, the intrasubtypic dynamics of influenza are dominated by the regime of intense competition identified by Gupta and coauthors. It has been shown that hosts of the same species can mount different immune responses after infection with identical strains. Wang et al. (1986) found that some strains provoked more varied responses than others: antibodies to Hong Kong pandemic strains induced antibodies to sites A and B or both, whereas a strain from 1978 induced antibodies to several epitopes. In humans, differences exist between the responses of children and adults. Nakajima et al. (2000) looked at the acute phase and convalescent sera of nine people infected with H3N2 during the 1990-1991 season (during the BE89 cluster) and found that all the young children had consistently narrower responses than adults. The sera of the three and four year old children had antibodies only to site B1, and all the older children and the one adult had antibodies binding to sites A, B1, B2, C, and C/E. In a follow-up study, Sato et al. (2004) examined the sera of 35 people who had been infected with a strain of the SY97 cluster and found that almost all young children developed antibodies to B1 and many to A. Everyone else developed a unique polyclonal response, often reacting more strongly to epitopes other than B1. Such observations have motivated proposals that variation in antibody repertoires could underlie the mechanism of antigenic drift in humans. These hypotheses differ in the role of populations with polyclonal responses. Nakajima et al. (2000) and Sato et al. (2004) posit that drift results from serial adaptation to monoclonally-responding subpopulations. Antigenic variants first escape site B1 and then sites targeted by others; despite the rarity of older children or adults with narrow responses to sites other than B1 in their study, we [can] not exclude the possibility that on a worldwide scale, individuals of this type may be numerous (Sato et al. 2004). This pattern, they note, fits evolution within BE89 but not SY97. Cleveland et al. (1997) recalled that major drift variants tend to have at least four amino acid substitutions in two epitopes (Wilson and Cox 1990). They predict the existence of four different human genetic groupings with consistent, nonoverlapping epitope biases. Viruses drift as they move from group to group, acquiring a critical amino acid change in each, and become double escape mutants. In contrast to Sato et al. (2004), they argue that polyclonal responses can select for drift mutants under particular conditions: extr"
BIO.G0.01.1,The Ecology and Epidemiology of Plague,Biology,Report,""
BIO.G0.02.1,Host-Parasite Interactions: On the Presumed Sympatric Speciation of Vidua,Biology,Report,"Ernst Mayr once wrote, sympatric speciation is like the Lernaean Hydra which grew two new heads whenever one of its old heads was cut off (1963:451). This observation, from his landmark text Animal Species and Evolution, marks the beginning of his systematic confutation of all evidence and theory pertaining to the possibility of sympatric speciation available at that time. Much has changed, however, in the field of biology since '63, but his point still remains valid: since Darwin's original vague descriptions on the requirements for speciation, many have forwarded models involving speciation in sympatry only to have them later disproved - or at least highly questioned - by the academic community (White, 1978; Coyne & Ore, 2004). As of late, a new surge of interest and research has once again made its way into the journals and texts. Recent publication, such as Via (2001), have attempted to review and bolster the newest evidence for speciation in sympatry; do these examples simply represent another head on the immortal hydra or has the tide shifted so much that we can accept the possibility of this type of speciation? Coyne & Orr (2004) doubt much of this new evidence; however, they offer that the likelihood of this mode in specific cases is increasing with each new paper published. Recently, yet another possible example has been described by science, which may offer some of the most compelling support for sympatric speciation. The system does not rely upon genetic changes to promote assortative mating, but instead offers an example where learned behavior may be crucial to mate selection (Beltman et al. , 2003; Beltman et al. , 2004). What herein follows is a review of this system and its implications; the work, done mostly by University of Michigan resident Robert Payne and Michael Sorenson of Boston University, is upon the many subspecies and sister species of the African indigobirds, Vidua spp. (Sorenson et al. , 2002). Historical geographic and genetic evidence - along with the effects of song learning - all seem to support rapid speciation in this genus, most likely under sympatric conditions. The brood parasitic indigobirds rely on a novel method to choose their parasitized host: they learn their song. Payne et al. (2004) describes this system in some detail and supports it with cross-foster experiments (Payne et al. , 1998, 2000). The most simplistic description of this host-parasite relationship is as follows: adult females of Vidua lay their eggs in the nests of several other finch species in West and Central Africa. They choose which species to parasitize based upon the male calls of that species: the call of their host father. Their young, subsequently, imprint upon the host species' song: females learn to respond to it and males learn to produce it. The females, then, choose their conspecfic mates based on the song of their heterospecific host parents. The cycle then repeats, when these now pregnant females choose where to lay their eggs based on the learned calls (Payne et al. , 2004). To date, this type of behavior has been observed in the indigobirds of Vidua, with most having specific hosts in Estrildidae (Sorenson et al. , 2004). Importantly, the observed morphological differences amongst indigobirds of Vidua appears to be a recent adaptation that helps their orphaned young better exploit their specific host species; mouth markings differ significantly, resembling those of the offspring of the parasitized host (Sorenson et al. , 2003). To counter act these markings some host species have gotten better and better at determining which mouths belong to their own species. However, Payne et al. (2001) suggest that this mechanism is not very efficient, and depends on many variables - such the number and type of young present and in the nest (type meaning heterospecific, conspecific, or mixed nest mates). Support for this song learning behavior is twofold: first, [1] cross foster experiments with non-traditional hosts supports the imprinting practice (Payne et al. , 1998, 2000); secondly, [2] in some described host-parasite complexes, their appears to be recent parasite switches, where the same species in sympatry have created two mutually exclusive breading pools by singing the songs of different host species - this would be the beginning of a speciation event (Payne et al. , 2002, 2005). These sympatric populations show little morphological differences, suggesting that these changes occur after the colonization of a new host species. Payne et al. conducted their first cross foster experiment in 1998, where they showed that male finches will learn the calls of their typical1 host, the red-billed firefinch (Lagonosticta senegala ), or a stand-in non-normal host parent, the Bengalese finch (Lonchura striata). They conducted a second experiment in 2000 to test the extent of female imprinting and further strengthen previous observations for the 1998 study. Their experiment was designed principally to test three hypotheses: an H0 of no preferential selection of host-nest by female indigobirds; an Ha1 of innate selection of normal parasitized hosts; and an Ha2 of a learned preferential selection of host-nest by females. Payne and his colleges performed the experiment with Vidua chalybeata, the village indigobird; again, it's normal host, the red-billed firefinch, and the experimental foster species, the Bengalese, finch were used. In the cross-foster experiments captive-reared indigobirds were raised by either the Bengalese finch or the red-billed finch, as adults they were tested for preferences in mate and nest choice. In the support of their Ha2, Payne et al. (2000) find that captive females raised by Bengalese finches both respond to males who sing the Bengalese song and choose to parasitize the nests of the Bengalese finch, over those of their normal host. Implicit here is also the finding that male indigos raised by Bengalese parents produce the calls of their heterospecific parents (Payne et al. , 1998). Additionally, the captives raised by the normal host species respond in predictable manners: choosing to mate with indigos who produced a red-billed finch song and exploiting the nests of these heterospecifics. Furthermore, the experimenters found that later exposure to non-parental type songs had no effect on mate choice or nest chosen for brood parasitism; suggesting a critical period for song acquisition and imprinting sometime before fledging - this finding is also consistent with Payne et al. (1998). When compared with other brood parasitizing bird species, these results are unique to the Vidua. Cowbirds, for example, are host generalists; both genetic and behavioral evidence suggest no pattern of consistent host selection (Payne et al. , 2000). Also, while there is some evidence of host specific preferences by females in the brood parasitic Cuckoo species (Cuculus spp.), male behaviors facilitate large quantities of gene flow between the female 'types', preventing the evolution of host-specific species. Male Cuckoos2 will mate with different females with different host preferences - meaning that any possibility of speciation is hindered by the male lineages (Payne et al. , 2000). Given that indigobirds can learn the call of a new host species in captivity, Payne et al. (2002, 2005) suggest that recent demographic changes may have forced a host switch in at least two separate Vidua species (V. chalybeata (2002) and V. camerunensis (2005)) - implying that this experimental data is supported by observational studies. The repercussions of these switches will be explored later; however, it is important to note here that both captive and wild indigobirds can and do occasionally learn songs of a novel host. The observation that host switching does occur in the indigobird species is the first step in showing that sympatric speciation is possible under the correct ecological conditions. Beltman et al. (2003, 2004) explore some of the general theoretical consequences that learning can have on a speciation event. Arguments against the creation of new species under sympatry often question the amount of gene flow that could occur between two recently divergent populations and the ability for a new colonizing type to find conspecific mates (White, 1978; Coyne & Orr, 2004). Beltman et al. (2004) show rather convincingly, however, that the novel nature of this host-parasite interaction where both the male and the female mutants will assortatively mate can facilitate speciation via a cultural trait. They suggest that, since indigobirds have low error rates in egg laying (�0�1%) and the tendency to mate only within your cultural group is so great - both males and females have mechanisms of imprinting - initial assortative mating based only on learned traits could eventually lead to genetically isolated species. Furthermore, the observed mechanisms used by the host species to counter act the parasitism, may force genetic changes that will later make possible a genetically based form of isolation (Beltman et al. 2004). However, they caution that the balance between low error rates and finding a conspecific mate create many difficulties; when colonization does occur the cost of finding a mate that knows the same song as you may be too high to make the colonization viable. Therefore, they assume that many colonization events probably occurred - only to fail many times - in the indigobird species before being successful (Beltman et al. , 2004). Conclusively showing that the observed diversification in indigos is due only to a learned song was beyond the scope of their paper; however, this theoretical work only supports the genetic evidence. Theoretical, verbal, and mathematical models can only go so far - descriptive and exhaustive field research is essential in showing what is actually happening. To this end, Sorenson and Payne have devoted a large portion of their fieldwork to genetics (Sorenson & Payne, 2001, 2002; Sorenson et al. 2003, 2004). Their research efforts have focused on the creation of an accurate phylogeny based upon genetic data - obvious arguments against this methodology and its application have been raised by many (see Coyne & Orr, 2004); however, their conclusions seem valid (Sorenson et al. 2003; Sefc et al. 2005). In any case, the many academic problems raised by this method will be discussed later. To best establish the evidence for sympatric divergence we will explore the work done by Payne, Sorenson, and their colleagues in the context of the eight criteria set down by Coyne & Orr (please see appendix, table 1). Thus, the following discussion will mirror the structure of Coyne & Orr, thereby, substantiating the presumed sympatric speciation of the indigobirds. The first criterion is simply met by these birds: their ranges do overlap largely and nearly completely - though the birds have been described in two geographic distributions: the West African indigos (seven species) and the Southern African indigos (four species, V. chalybeata is present in both populations). Comprehensive field descriptions of the species distributions have been done by Payne. Of interest is Payne's 1982 publication; in this particular case, Payne described, among other things, the ranges of five species of Vidua 3 and their hosts' ranges4. All species were found to be sympatric in the range studied5. In addition, this data set supports the second tenet of Coyne & Orr: it shows that these species do parasitize specific hosts - though, occasionally, they do make mistakes (Sefc et al. , 2005; Payne & Sorenson, 2004). Sorenson et al. (2004) clearly establishes the host-parasite relationship in a phylogenic reconstruction (see appendix figure 2); this data suggests that some Vidua parasitize multiple hosts occasionally (dotted lines), while others are very host-specific. In addition, this data illustrates the complexity of the speciation events occurring: the Vidua do not simply mirror the speciation events of their hosts - they radiated much later6. This is unlike many host-parasite speciation relationships, where a geographic separation of host populations caused a speciation event in both the host and parasite populations. The third tenet, and perhaps one of the most challenging to meet, states that the parasites must be sister taxa - implying the necessity of clear phylogenic relationships. Coyne & Orr caution that a genetically based phylogeny may show inaccurate relationships and divergence rates - since interspecific hybridization probably occurs, tainting the gene pool. Exhaustive phylogenetic work, however, (mostly mtDNA) supports a sister taxa relationship (Sorenson et al. , 2002, 2004; Sorenson & Payne, 2001, 2002). The data of Sorenson et al. (2002) presents the clearest image of these relationships; summarized in figure 3 of the appendix, are is this phylogeny of both Viduidae and Estrildidae. While this work is genetic in nature, theoretically mathematical models (see Sefc et al. , 2005) on these particular relationships demonstrate its validity. Sefc et al. argues that, though the hybridization does occur, it is not often enough to significantly skew the data sets. In addition, this study established that the indigobirds meet the fourth criterion: reproductive isolation. Sefc et al. shows that the species are distinct and genetically isolated; importantly, however, this is not genetically based isolation - it is learned. Further direct observational data of hybridization can be found in Payne & Sorenson (2004); here the authors observed hybridization between V. paradisaea and V. chalybeata - this hybridization was established by genetic tests (mtDNA). Thus far, the Vidua seem to conform to the first four tenets of Coyne & Orr. Clearly, the fifth criterion of Coyne & Orr has already been well established: assortative mating does occur. Undeniably, Payne and Sorenson have shown countless times that the indigos preferentially choose conspecifics based on a learned call. This evidence has already been presented earlier, thus, will not be repeated. Allowing us then, to focus on the six and seventh criteria; it is best to take these two in tandem, since they represent very similar principles. First, as explained above the indigobird's young have developed specific mouth markings to deceive host parents; these markings represent both a genetic adaptation to a specific host and a means by which fitness is increased with the normative host (Payne et al. , 2001). Essentially, this evidence is used to forward a true species distinction in the face of introgression, and demonstrates that each species has adapted to their respective host. Coyne & Orr argue that a species definition based solely on a cultural trait, may be meaningless (2004:221-222). However, since these markings establish differences outside of simple maternal mitochondrial lineages, it is safe to conclude a true species distinction. Outside of the descriptive studies, which demonstrate these differences (Payne, 1982), Payne et al. (2001) has done cross-foster experiments indicating a fitness advantage to the normative host based on the mouth markings. Their study focused mainly upon V. chalybeata, and interestingly showed that, while fitness advantages are present they are not great enough to prevent colonization of new hosts. This suggests that the indigobirds exist in a very narrow adaptive peak, where colonization advantages are only partially restrained by host specificity. Once a new niche is realized, it is best to evolve host-distinct features, when the peculiarity conveys fitness advantages. Finally then, we are left with the eighth, and last tenet, of Coyne & Orr: the biogeographic and evolutionary history of the taxa makes an allopatric phase very unlikely (emphasis theirs, 158). While conforming to this criterion is difficult, both direct and indirect evidence seem to imply no allopatric phase (Payne, 1982; Payne et al. , 2002, 2005). Direct evidence comes from the geography of Africa; currently, the populations are sympatric and there seems to be no geographic barrier - past or present - to gene flow (Payne, 1982). Additionally, and more interestingly, there appears to observable sympatric speciation currently occurring in some Vidua populations; this evidence indirectly supports past sympatric speciation - since it supports the hypothetical possibility of this speciation mode (Payne et al. , 2002, 2005). In their work done in 2002, Payne and his colleagues describe a system apparently limited to a population of indigos living on the Zambezi River. The populations consists of V. chalybeata, its normal host, L. senegala, and a novel host, L. nitidula. Genetic evidence suggests a recent switch of V. chalybeata from L. senegala to L. nitidula; this switch occurred in sympatry. Importantly, morphological features seem to have lagged behind this behavioral switch - aside from song no diagnostic technique can distinguish the two 'cultural morphs'. More interesting still are the kinship implications derived from mtDNA microsatellite analysis. There is a high incidences of relatedness between the L. nitidula parasites; specifically, the genes suggest that the host switch occurred four specific times, representing four matrilines. Essentially, it appears that the first steps toward speciation have occurred - in fact the L. nitidula morph was even once mistakenly describe as a new species (V. incognita by Nicolai (1972)). Payne et al. (2002) does not speculate on why the switch occurred; however, in a similar system described with V. camerunensis environmental changes by humans may account for the host switch - they cite the concurrent introduction of wheat to the region (circa 0 A.D.)(Payne et al. , 2005). With the advancement of genetic technology, a vast quantity of data is being generated in the field of evolutionary biology. This new information has been applied by many to determine the nature of the biological systems observed, and has generated a resurgence of interest in sympatric speciation (Via, 2004). It remains unclear, however, if this new data will decisively end this debate; nonetheless, it has visibly altered the way we think about speciation. Apparently, Payne, Sorenson, and their colleagues, have described a system that has the general trappings of sympatric speciation; it meets all the criteria set down by Coyne & Orr and, also, relies upon a novel system to promote assortative mating: song learning. With further evidence and advancements in methodology, we may soon be able to demonstrate a more complex model for this speciation event, further supporting a hypothesis of sympatric speciation. As of now, it appears that 'cultural' traits can, in this instance, serve as the initial step towards speciation. Concerning this particular case, Coyne & Orr have written this constitutes one of the few plausible cases of sympatric speciation (222); and, given their usual staunch skepticism toward sympatric speciation, this is a clear stamp of approval. Hopefully, further systems will support these conclusions. summarized from Coyne & Orr (2004:158) FIGURE 1: RANGE MAP SYNTHESIZED FROM PAYNE (1982) FIGURE 1: This figure represents the areas of sympatry for five Vidua species (V. chaybeata, V. larvaticola, V. raricola, V. funereal, and V. wilsoni) observed by Payne and synthesized from figures 5, 16, 21, 25, 49, 58 (in Payne 1982).

BIO.G0.02.2,Sensory Drive and Speciation,Biology,Report,"Do ecological constraints favour certain perceptual systems and, thus, generate species-specific modes of mate signalling; or, do these modes and traits vary arbitrarily? Boughman (2002) proposes that - while Fisher's runaway model accurately predicts the exaggeration of males signalling traits - a more holistic model based on the exact nature of the environment and the physiology of the organism, and its perceptual systems, better explains interspecific differences. Specifically, Boughman suggests clinal-like differences in habitat, or microhabitat, can promote sensory system differences, which then shape signalling modalities. This model - called the sensory drive hypothesis - does not necessarily contest Fisher's model, and may work in conjunction with it and other models to promote the variation of mating-specific traits. The sensory drive hypothesis predicts that signalling systems will be shaped by three specific environment-organism interactions. Given the general nature of intersexual pressures, for our discussion the receiver of a signal will be taken as the female of the species, while the signaller as the male. Boughman briefly describes the three interactions and defines them as: [1] habitat transmission, [2] perceptual tuning, and [3] signal matching. Taken in turn, each of these properties shape the signalling system of the organism and interact to generate a specific signalling system. First, habitat transmission describes what signal best passes through the environment. Theoretically, the best call would travel relatively intact through the environment; preservation - in light of the degradation caused by the abiotic properties of the habitat - is favoured. Secondly, perceptual tuning describes the exploitation of female adaptations specific to non-mate-finding tasks by males: such as finding food and/or detecting predators. For example, Smith et al. (2004) suggest that the female preference for red coloured jaws and throats in male three-spined sticklebacks ( Gasterosteus aculeatus) evolved in response to foraging preferences; in essence, male sticklebacks exploit females' preferences for red colouring. Finally, the third tenant of Boughman model - signal matching - implies that males should produce calls that females can easily detected given the physiological nature of their sensory systems. Unsurprisingly, producing a call that is within the female's range of greatest sensitivity is beneficial both to the males (wasting unheard calls) and to the females (reducing search costs for potential mates). Under allopatry, then, is easy to see how these signalling constraints could changes in response to habitat and cause divergence. Boughman describes several examples of such changes in habitat producing divergent sensory adaptations - such as the colour sensitivity in fish. She observes that several inland varieties of snapper (Lutjanidae family) have spectral shifts towards green - enhancing their perception in the yellow-green waters of their habitat - while their reef dwelling cousins have spectral shifts towards blue, best for their less turbid waters. It then follows that if colouration were important for mate choice in this family, sexual selection would produce male colourings best for the snapper's environment and most easily matched to females' sensory ranges. Such a system could drive divergence of shore populations and reef populations in both female preference and male signalling modes. Consequentially, Boughman suggests these changing systems could then promote speciation via assortative mating. She verbally describes a modal where, under allopatry, sensory drive produces enough changes in the two populations to prevent heterospecific mate recognition should sympatry reoccur. These changes could both strengthen other reproductive barriers and/or act as the primary barrier to heterospecific mating. In addition, she observes that species-specific microhabitat assortment during mating would also enforce species boundaries. This microhabitat assortment could be a by-product of sensory system changes, usually related to niche specific adaptations or constraints, or related to predatory pressures. As always, Boughman recognizes that a host of apomorphic traits might work together to promote assortative mating and that specific studies are necessary to observe the causality of a speciation event presumed to be a product of sensory drive. Furthermore, she recognizes that ecologically similar species are unlikely to coexist, even when some sexual isolation exists (574). That is to say that under sympatry, if the changes are not large enough to prevent hybridization then stabilizing selection might push the species together again. Conversely, if the species are sexual isolated, but occupying the same niche, then one species may go extinct if they do not evolve towards different environments first. It seems that, while sensory drive is pivotal to certain speciation events, it often works in conjunction with other isolating mechanisms to produce species. Boughman's model helps refocus the researcher's eye on the ecological that produces and physiology of an organisms sensory system. Future studies can, therefore, be illuminated by this model and take into account the effect of the habitat on the signalling modality.

BIO.G0.02.3,Plant Pollination Systems: Evolutionary Trends in Generalization and Specialization,Biology,Report,"Perhaps one of the most intriguing varieties of mutualism is the relationship between angiosperms and their pollinators. The evolutionary forces at work in these systems continue to both intrigue and perplex botanists and evolutionary biologists. In a relatively recent paper, Johnson & Steiner (2000) explore the common theories, misconceptions, and research methodologies that are used in the study of plant-pollinator relationships. They challenge some long held ideas about the nature of specialization and generalization of floral complexes, and suggest that the cause of these trends may be more complex than current thinking predicates. In addition, they explore the implications of ecosystem alterations and the threat of extinction on the more specialized mutualists. Theoretically, specialization and generalization of plants to pollinators offers some mutually exclusive advantages. These advantages stem form the observation of Stebbin that specialization is best when the most effective pollinator's availability is reliable, whereas generalization should be favored when pollinator availability is irregular. From this theoretical framework many hypotheses have been forwarded and tested concerning these systems. In their review Johnson & Steiner reconsider some of the theories. For example, plants which cover a large range should favor specialization for particularly specific insects who are themselves specialized to the plants - because excess pollen for a variety of other plant species might clog-up their reproductive bits. In addition to this observation, Johnson & Steiner explore a host of other ideas about these systems, such as: the impact of plant life-histories, colonization practices, and breeding systems on the tendency to generalize or specialize. From this theoretical base the authors then explore and intriguing cause of convergence present in the plant world - which they refer to as pollination syndromes. These syndromes, it is argued, are driven by similar needs for similar pollinator types. For example, large pollinators - such as butterflies - may prefer larger flowers with specific colors, whereas smaller pollinators may favor smaller flowers with alternative colorings. One well studied instance of this type of favoring has been documented in the Mumulus (monkeyflower). It is thought that the preferential dispositions of these animals drives convergence in unrelated genera of plants. Therefore, the penchant of evening or night pollination by moths, would drive plants to have syndromes that make pollination more easy for these pollinators. The authors question, however, the simplistic causal relationship within theses systems. They argue that some theoretical evidence denies, for example, some common notions about these systems: such as, the importance of flower coloring as a mode of specialization. This is important from an evolutionary biologists standpoint because often these syndromes are seen as an isolating mechanism in sympatry. However, since the casual relationship is often unclear, the authors argue prudence when exploring speciation events based on these traits. Furthermore, they argue that geographic trends might also play a large role in the specialization or generalization of plants. Since ecosystems are notably different in northern and southern climates, they authors argue that other abiotic factors maybe driving the trends of specialization and generalization. Finally, then, the authors explore the implications of the budding quantity of evidence on efforts for conservation. They observe that the lifespan of plants versus pollinators, may give false impressions about the intrinsic link between pollinators and their plants; since some plants may survive long after their specific pollinator is gone, we may witness a delayed extinction in these species. It seems that as the study of these amazing systems grows, so will are our understanding of evolutionary convergence and speciation, and our best means of species protection and management.

BIO.G0.02.4,"Chromosomal Rearrangements, Recombination Suppression, and Speciation: A Review of Rieseberg 2001",Biology,Report,"The causal link between chromosomal rearrangements and speciation events is still considered by many to be unclear. Whether new arrangements arise after speciation to reinforce species' boundaries or, instead, serve as the primary isolation mechanism in speciation, is some what of an enigma to evolutionary biologists. Furthermore, the exact mechanism, by which these two outcomes arise, remains uncertain. Shedding new light on this quandary, Rieseberg (2001) offers a new theoretical mechanism by which these changes might facilitate speciation and/or provide a barrier to gene flow after a speciation event. Her contention arises from the observation that chromosomal rearrangements affecting specific loci may in fact inhibit recombination, thereby, extending there range of influence within the genome. While her theoretical mechanism is still largely untested, its ability to strengthen some current models - which otherwise seem less parsimonious, by relying too heavily on reduced heterospecific fitness - seems a compelling reason to further explore the theory. Many traditional models of chromosomal speciation depend greatly upon the existence of small isolated populations, where drift can play a major role in determining the fixation of a new rearrangement. Furthermore, these models assume that these underdominant mutations impair hybrid fertility and/or viability, thus, generating species boundaries. These models often implore drift alone to engender fixation of mutations in very small populations, rendering them unlikely forces in speciation. None the less, many of the models presented do offer observational evidence to support their particular mechanisms. Rieseberg's main critic against these models, though, is that reduced gene flow between population appears to strongly enforce species boundaries and that reduced gene flow can be produced without the total hybrid sterility or inviability inherent in these models. The importance of this observation becomes more evident when one examines the differential effects of chromosomal rearrangements across organism types. To date, it has been shown that these types of mutations more strongly affect plant hybrid fertility/viability than animal hybrids. This conclusion stems from two complimentary lines of reasoning: [1] Sterility in plants is more likely because the male gamete often expresses more of its genome; meaning that, if a chromosomal abnormality is present in the pollen the plant gamete itself has a higher tendency to abort. This does not occur in animal sperm. Secondly [2], the XY type sex determination in animals has led to a very genetically sparse Y-type chromosome. The degenerate Y-chromosome facilities genetic, but not chromosomal, hybrid sterility. Even in plant populations, which use this system for sex determination, the degradation of the Y-chromosome is less apparent. The observation that sterility/inviability of plant hybrids is more often chromosomal, whereas sterility/inviability of animal hybrids is more often genetic constrains the current models, which depend so much upon this reduced hybrid fitness. From these considerations, Reiseberg offers a more simplistic model to reduce gene flow after a chromosomal rearrangement, than heterospecific fitness. She observes that these rearrangements can strongly effect recombination without rendering the offspring infertile. If the rearrangement is within or linked to an isolating locus of the genome, then reduced gene flow will occur as a result of a lack of recombination. Chromosomal rearrangements can function in this way even when they do not affect hybrid fitness. This theory, however, is still limited because reduced gene flow itself may not cause speciation; furthermore, it is only with an accumulation of many neutral or weakly underdominant rearrangements, linked to isolation loci, that a larger portion of the genome can be affected. One limitation of this model, however, is that is does not help determine whether the arrangement occurred before or after speciation. However, unlike many of the present models, it does allow for speciation in sympatry or parapatry, as well as, reinforcement of allopatrically derived species - which have come together in secondary contact. Reiseberg's new theoretical mechanism proves to be both interesting and plausible. Given further empirical data, it may serve as the new standard model of chromosomal speciation.

BIO.G0.02.5,On the Origins of Man: Understanding the Last Two Million Years,Biology,Report,"In the past two decades, our understanding of the human genome has increased at remarkable rate. This expansion of our genetic knowledge promised to resolve longstanding questions regarding the origins and evolution of mankind (Eller, 2002). However, after nearly fifteen years of research, our understanding remains limited; genes have raised far more questions then they have answered. Two models, proposed nearly thirty years ago, still hold weight in the anthropological community: the Multiregional and the Replacement model of the evolution of mankind (Eller, 2002). A critical review of various studies concerning the two models and, specifically, of recent genetic evidence concerning the interaction of Homo sapiens and Homo neanderthalensis (Caramelli et al., 2003; Gibbons, 2001; Kahn & Gibbons, 1997; Krings et al., 2000; Krings et al., 1997; Ovchinnikov et al., 2000), will reveal that - while both models are far too simplistic - a pattern closer to Replacement is more likely. The Multiregional model of evolution, in its most basic from, argues that the since the original spread of H. erectus out of Africa, approximately 1.7-mya (million years ago), the 'human' population has been one large interbreeding mass (Eller, 2002). This population slowly evolved into what we consider modern humans with no side branching or distinct speciation events occurring in Eurasia, Australasia, or Africa (Eller, 2002; Templeton, 2002). Naturally, the model dictates that the morphological differences and geographical distances between all populations of humans were not enough to genetically isolate them and, thus, the modern human form evolved simultaneously across the entire old-world (Templeton, 2002). Milford Wolpoff, of the University of Michigan, originally proposed this model based solely upon archeological and morphological evidence (Lahr, 1994). Since the models incarnation, however, researchers have forwarded limited genetic evidence and some new morphological evidence to support the model (Hawks & Wolpoff, 2001; Templeton, 2002). Furthermore, research, done by Vinayak Eswaran, into population dynamics may also support a multiregional-like model - though Eswaran's model is more complex then Wolpoff's (Eswaran, 2002). Contrary to Multiregionalism is the Replacement model. This model dictates that after H. erectus' initial expansion into the new world, a new form of hominids evolved in Africa, H. sapiens (sometimes written: H. sapiens sapiens) (Treisman, 1995). This new species - after migrating into Eurasia and Australasia approximately 100-kya (thousand years ago) - replaced H. erectus and H. neanderthalensis without inbreeding or hybridization (Eller, 2002). In this model, H. neanderthalensis evolved outside of Africa. The evidence from the Replacement model comes mostly from genetic analysis of modern human lineages and limited fossil evidence (Collard & Franchino, 2002; Jorde et al., 2000). Recently, genetic evidence from H. neanderthalensis and Cro-Magnon man (ancient presumed H. sapiens from around 25-kya) further supports the Replacement model (Caramelli et al., 2003; Krings et al., 2000; Krings et al., 1997; Ovchinnikov et al., 2000). These two models are graphically represented in Figure 1, where the single line from Africa in the rightmost image represents H. Sapiens. Fig 1: Multiregional vs. Replacement Model (Eller, 2002) The thrust of the evidence for the Multiregional model comes from comparisons of morphological differences between all known fossils of the last 2 million years and separate comparisons of their archeologically represented cultural traits - that is tool use and burial behaviors (Hawks & Wolpoff, 2001). John Hawks and Wolpoff believe that the morphological differences between the presumed species are insignificant variations - perhaps due to local climatic adaptation - and have not isolated the groups genetically (Hawks & Wolpoff, 2001). In fact, they content that these morphological differences are not large enough to advance a species difference between any hominid fossil since the emergence H. erectus (Hawks & Wolpoff, 2001). A review of one recent research endeavor concerning H. neanderthalensis and H. sapiens will show that the conclusions about morphological differences are not well founded, thereby, discrediting some claims held by the multiregionalists (Collard & Franchino, 2002; Kramer, Crummett, & Wolpoff, 2001). A recent study, done by Andrew Kramer, claims to support Wolpoff's contention that H. neanderthalensis does not form a separate species. The study analyzes differences in cranial features between presumed H. neanderthalensis and anatomically modern humans (H. Sapiens), both found in the Levant region (Kramer et al., 2001). This region is thought to be the central hub of migrations between Eurasia and Africa (Walter et al., 2000). Using pairwise analysis differences of six fossils presumed to be anatomically modern humans (Skhul IV, V, & IX and Qafzeh III, VI, IX) and two fossils presumed to be Neandertals (Tabun and Amud) - all from Levant - Kramer concludes that morphological differences are not great enough to make the Neandertals a separate species in this region. In addition, they include thirteen other skulls from around the same time, but from different locations throughout Eurasia. These skulls are composed of six presumed Neandertals, six presumed modern humans, and one non-human primate (KNM-ER 3733) - as an out-group - and are employed to test their methodology. Finally, they analyze twelve character traits using various subsets of these seventeen skulls with the program PAUP* 4.0 and create various phylogenies. (Kramer et al., 2001) From their analysis of just the Levant fossils and the out-group fossil, they do not find a separate clade for the Neandertals and other Hominids of Levant (Kramer et al., 2001). However, an analysis of just the non-Levant male Neandertals, the non-Levant male modern humans, and the out-group reveals a separate clade for the Neandertals; this abnormality is brushed off as outside the aim of the research and, thus, insignificant. Furthermore, and more curious, the researchers never present or discus a PAUP* 4.0 analysis of all seventeen fossils, again their reasoning being that they are only concerned with the Levantine relationships. They then conclude that inbreeding was present at Levant and, therefore, possible throughout the old-world, thereby, supporting a multiregional inbreeding model. This conclusion is not easily reconciled with the data, which suggests that, even if only in Europe, two separate clades of Neandertals and modern humans existed (Kramer et al., 2001). Therefore, their research scarcely supports the multiregional hypothesis and may even support Replacement. Furthermore, Mark Collard's research, in the use of pairwise difference analysis for morphological cranial features, suggests that the theoretical assumptions made by Kramer in the aforementioned study may be suspect (Collard & Franchino, 2002). Specifically, Collard proposes that the pairwise analysis - popular for DNA research - is not reliable for cranial morphology analysis. Specifically, Collard attempts to reconstruct the phylogenies of various extant primates groups (Homo, Pan, Gorilla, Pongo, and Hylobates) using craniodental and soft tissue features, many similar to the features used by Kramer (Collard & Franchino, 2002; Kramer et al., 2001). These groups have known phylogenies based on molecular data and other non-facial morphological differences (Boyd & Silk, 2003; Collard & Franchino, 2002). Collard attempts to make phylogenies based on: [1] 96 qualitative craniodental features, [2] 171 soft tissue characters (qualitative), and [3] 129 quantitative craniodental characters, all from two sets of 182 and 100 individuals (combination of all species) with at least 20 individuals from each species in the sets. This is a considerably larger data set then the one used by Kramer (Collard & Franchino, 2002; Kramer et al., 2001). None of the generated phylogenies agree with the known phylogenies of the extant primates (Collard & Franchino, 2002). However, Collard does not use PAUP* 4.0 for is analysis but a different program to create his trees. Thus, Collard's research may not completely invalidate the use of facial features, but it certainly cast doubt on the practical use of them. Further evidence also casts doubt on the archeological basis for Multiregionalism (Lahr, 1994; Walter et al., 2000); however, there is still much debate on the conclusions presented above (Hawks & Wolpoff, 2001). In the next section, the genetic evidence presented will generally support these conclusions, which invalidate traditional Multiregionalism. However, the evidence will also suggest that a complete replacement is unlikely. Instead, a complex system with more aspects of Replacement, but some aspects Multiregionalism, is necessary. In contrast to Multiregionalism, the Replacement model relies heavily upon genetic evidence, owing its existence to a flawed mtDNA (mitochondrial DNA) analysis in 1987 (Templeton, 2002). Despite the models beginnings, much more evidence has arisen to support the theory (Jorde et al., 2000; Kimmel, 1999; Quintana-Murci et al., 1999; Templeton, 2002; Thomson, Pritchard, Shen, Oefner, & Feldman, 2000; Underhill et al., 2000). The DNA evidence falls fundamentally in two categories: [1] comparisons of modern human diversity and [2] comparisons of ancient DNA Neandertals and Cro-Magnon man to modern humans (Jorde et al., 2000; Krings et al., 1997). For the time being, we will only concern ourselves with the modern human diversity argument, leaving the Neandertal evidence for later discussion. The modern human diversity argument proposes that given the genetic diversity of modern man, a large bottleneck likely occurred sometime in the last 100,000 years (Eller, 2002). This bottleneck presumably represents a small population of H. Sapiens, who evolved in Africa, replacing all other living hominid species (Eller, 2002; Kimmel, 1999). In many ways, the date of this bottleneck epitomizes the arguments between the two models: both agree that man arose in Africa, but disagree on the date of his diaspora and the effects of his diaspora on population dynamics (Wall, 2000). The theoretical reasoning behind the detection of the bottleneck lies in a mathematical function known as a Laplace transformation (Kimmel, 1999). While the actual workings of this function are unimportant, Marek Kimmel has observed that - despite the instability inherent in the equation - simulation studies have proven that it can effectively predict population size changes and, thus, be applied to detect signs of a population bottleneck. Researchers have used several classes of DNA evidence (Y-Chromosome DNA, mtDNA and Autosomal DNA) to investigate the possibility of a bottleneck and, subsequently, have attempted to date any observed bottleneck event(s) (Jorde et al., 2000). All attempts at dating, however, have utilized the same theoretical assumption: They have all relied upon a stable mutation rate of their respective DNA, assuming selective neutrality of their DNA regions (Thomson et al., 2000). Thus, the researchers are able to predict a date of divergence by effectively counting the number of mutations in the present population and comparing them to the molecular clock of mutation rates. To set their clocks, the researchers must use DNA from the last known ancestor of the human, the chimpanzee, which diverged from modern man approximately 5 million years ago (Thomson et al., 2000). Again, by comparing the overall differences between chimpanzee and human DNA they are able to establish a rate of mutation for whatever region they are studying; of course, this inherently assumes that the divergence date from Pan troglodytes is correct, this date being based on fossil evidence (Boyd & Silk, 2003). Two recent studies using these methods have employed Y-chromosome DNA, and offer nearly identical dates if divergence (Thomson et al., 2000; Underhill et al., 2000), however they do not prove the Replacement model since so much theory is still in question (Hammer et al., 1998; Hawks & Wolpoff, 2001; Templeton, 2002; Thomson et al., 2000; Underhill et al., 2000; Wall, 2000). The first researcher, Peter Underhill, analyzes 167 polymorphisms on a portion of NRY DNA (non-recombinant y-chromosome DNA) from 1062 individuals (Underhill et al., 2000). Underhill attempts to accurately represents the genetic diversity of the human population by choosing an ethnically diverse group - a rather common practice in studies of this nature (Jorde et al., 2000; Templeton, 2002; Thomson et al., 2000; Underhill et al., 2000). Underhill found that the largest amount of genetic diversity occurs in Africa and detected a bottleneck event approximately 59-kya. This estimate assumes 6,900 years between new mutations, with an average of 8.6 mutations in any population. Underhill accounts for the many sources of error with an upper and lower limit of 35-kya and 89-kya. This estimate is much more recent than the original 100-kya (Eller, 2002; Underhill et al., 2000). The second researcher, Russell Thomson, analyzes three genes found on the Y-chromosome (SMCY, DBY & DFFRY) (Thomson et al., 2000). Combined the genes represent 64,120bp, show 56 unique (non-repeating) polymorphisms, and have an average calculated mutation rate of 1.24e-9bp per year. Extrapolating a phylogeny from this data set using GENETREE, Thomson found a bottleneck event approximately 50-kya, with the most diverse population being African. This all suggests a modern African origin, with an expansion around 50-kya. However, while both of these studies seem to support the Replacement model, there is still a considerable amount of further research needed. Both Underhill and Thomson have stated that the lack of genetic diversity on the Y-chromosome may be a result of selection pressure (Thomson et al., 2000; Underhill et al., 2000) and, therefore, invalidating their mutation rate estimates. Furthermore, Thomson recognizes that these date-estimates do not agree with other genetic evidence, such as the �-globin loci, which place the bottleneck at a much earlier date more in agreement with the Multiregional model (Templeton, 2002; Thomson et al., 2000). Conversely, Thomson and Underhill's estimates agree with other genetic evidence such as mtDNA and Autosomal DNA (Jorde et al., 2000). All this conflicting evidence remains to be thoroughly reconciled. However, the large body of genetic evidence seems to support to a pattern akin to the Replacement model. Some of the problems associated with the genetic examination of human history lie in its inability to examine DNA from the extinct hominids (Hawks & Wolpoff, 2001). However, with new techniques, pioneered by Svante Paabo, this type of analysis has become possible (Krings et al., 1997). In the last six years, scientists have been able to reconstruct two partial genomes of H. neanderthalensis (Krings et al., 1997; Ovchinnikov et al., 2000). Analysis of these genomes has suggested to some that the Neandertal did not contribute to the modern day gene pool (Caramelli et al., 2003; Gibbons, 2001; Kahn & Gibbons, 1997; Krings et al., 2000; Krings et al., 1997; Ovchinnikov et al., 2000) and, thus, was an evolutionary dead-end. This would mean that modern humans replaced the Neandertal in Eurasia and Australasia. Matthias Krings was the first to successfully study Neandertal DNA in 1997 (Krings et al., 1997). His analysis was of mtDNA of a Neandertal found in Feldhofer, Germany, which dated less then 100-ky old. For this study and all subsequent studies since mtDNA is used because, on average, per cell there are a significant number of copies of mtDNA, as opposed to the one nuclear copy of DNA (Krings et al., 1997; Ovchinnikov et al., 2000). Krings duplicated fragments of the mtDNA using PCR and obtained a 379bp fragment. The amplification process on ancient DNA (aDNA) has yet to be proven entirely reliable, but recent studies suggest that with the proper precautions a reliable sample can be obtained (Gilbert et al., 2003). Krings then proceeded to compare the sequence with that of modern humans and chimpanzees. He obtained an average difference of 8.0 � 3.0 substitutions for a human-human comparison, 25.6 � 2.2 substitutions for the human-Neandertal comparison, and 55.0 � 3.0 for a human-chimpanzee relationship; this data is summarized in Figure 2. In addition, Krings found that the mtDNA of the Neandertal was no more closely related to the mtDNA of any regional group of modern humans and, thus, in disagreement with the Multiregional Model. This model predicts that European Neandertals should be closest in relation to modern Europeans, reflecting the assimilation of the Neandertal DNA by hybridization into local populations. Furthermore, he was able to reconstruct a phylogeny of humans, Neandertals, and chimps predicting a human-Neandertal split approximately 550-kya to 690-kya. He is careful to note that this phylogeny only compares one partial Neandertal mtDNA genome and, therefore, should be interpreted cautiously. (Krings et al., 1997) Fig 2: Net Substitution Differences (Krings et al., 1997) In 2000, Igor Ovchinnikov studied a second mtDNA sequence from a Neandertal, who dated at ~29-ky old (Ovchinnikov et al., 2000). Archeologists unearthed the Neandertal in the Mezmaiskaya cave in northern Caucasus - 2,500km from the Germen location, Feldhofer. Using the same precautions and general techniques of Krings, Ovchinnikov was able to extract a 345bp segment of mtDNA. Comparisons of this strand to the Feldhofer strand, modern humans, and chimpanzees revealed a parsimoniously phylogeny (with the lowest bootstrap number being 95/100), where Neandertals composed a separate species with a last common ancestor between 151-kya and 352-kya. This date, utilizing both the Feldhofer and Mezmaiskaya sample, is a more accurate prediction then the previous. As with Krings, Ovchinnikov stresses the same cautious interpretation of the data, but offers that the new evidence reinforces both the techniques and the conclusions of Krings. (Ovchinnikov et al., 2000) David Caramelli has offers more evidence to support the conclusion that Neandertal and humans did not interbreed (Caramelli et al., 2003). Caramelli's research is unique to the previous studies because it utilizes ancient mtDNA from two Cro-Magnon men fossils (archaic H. Sapiens) dating ~23-kya and ~24-kya and compares it with Neandertal mtDNA sequences. He found that the differences between the Cro-Magnon mtDNA and modern human DNA to be negligible: Cro-Magnon man falls well with in the range of modern human diversity. Moreover, Caramelli discovered that Neandertal mtDNA differed significantly from both the Cro-Magnon and modern human, so much so that unless a very abnormal selection event occurred these Neandertals never interbreed with neighboring Cro-Magnon and, thus, did not contribute to the modern gene pool. However, his data falls short of a proof given the nature of aDNA research. (Caramelli et al., 2003) The process of extracting fifty-thousand year old DNA is no easy task. The complications and possible sources of contamination have been the main critics of the Neandertal finds (Gilbert et al., 2003). Only more research in the field will resolve the questions created by the research. However, the data suggests the there were at least two distinct species of hominids, suggesting a Replacement model pattern. The problem that lies in both models is the oversimplification of a complex evolutionary history. Understanding of selection pressures and varying mutations rates remains limited. Furthermore, neither of the two models in their present form can reconcile all the known data - both genetic and morphological. No one model has yet sufficiently explained the discrepancies between the various genetic results (mtDNA, Y-Chromosome, �-globin, etc.). The new Neandertal evidence seems to bolster Replacement, but given the available data, a more complex pattern replacement seems likely. Recent attempts to make models that are more complex have also fallen short (Eswaran, 2002; Excoffier, 2002). Erik Trinkaus, of Washington University, best summons up the current state of human origin theory: I believe that it [Eswaran's model] suffers from a problem shared with the majority of the current and past models of modern human emergence: namely, it tries to explain too much of a geographically and temporally complex process with a single mechanism . . .

BIO.G0.04.1,Fetal Endocrine System,Biology,Report,"This article reviews the effects that maternal nutrition can produce in the fetus through leptin and other components of the fetal endocrine system, both immediately and in the long-run. Early, but not late, maternal overnutrition increases fetal plasma leptin and adipose tissue mass, while early, but not late, maternal undernutrition causes fetal hypoinsulinemia and hypoleptinemia and postnatal hyperphagia, obesity, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperleptinemia. Because many adult diseases seem to be pre-programmed in utero, this field has the potential to be very beneficial to society. The developing fetal endocrine system can adjust in response to maternally induced changes in its intrauterine environment. Depending on the nature and duration of the stress, the fetal endocrine system and growth development may alter permanently and may be responsible for diseases such as hypertension, obesity, and insulin insensitivity in adulthood (1). This review will look at the effects that maternal nutrition can have on the fetus and its endocrine system and the role that the protein leptin plays in mediating this. Unless otherwise stated, this article focuses on the sheep; sheep make an ideal human model because the fetal sheep shows similar metabolic responses to the human fetus, undergoes a relatively long gestation, and can be manipulated easily (1, 10). The 16 kDa protein leptin acts as an adiposity signal in the adult. It indicates nutritional status and responds to excess energy by depressing appetite and increasing glucose and fat metabolism (2). Leptin levels rise after food consumption in response to increases in plasma glucose and insulin and help indicate satiety (12). This product of the ob gene acts primarily through brain receptors to modulate hypothalamic control of food intake and sympathetic stimulation of energy expenditure (5). Various tissues express some level of leptin, but the most significant source is adipose tissue (4). Leptin additionally suppresses the orexigenic peptide neuropeptide Y and its mRNA (Neuropeptide Y stimulates hyperphagia and subsequent obesity in the adult and amniotic fluid swallowing as ingestive behavior in the fetus) (5). Leptin levels also correlate with the amount of body fat. As food intake increases and introduces excess energy into the body, lipogenesis is stimulated and the newly synthesized adipose tissue secretes additional leptin (4). The fetal hypothalamus also expresses leptin receptors, suggesting that leptin may also play a role in fetal metabolic regulation (9). In normal fetal development, leptin mRNA expression in adipose tissue peaks in the second half of gestation and then undergoes a decline (5). Circulating levels of leptin reflect the amount of leptin mRNA expression in fetal adipose tissue (3), although in humans the placenta may also contribute to plasma leptin levels (5). Maternal pigs that were overfed during the second quarter of pregnancy produced offspring with increased levels of plasma leptin and leptin mRNA in adipose tissue (7). Two explanations have been proposed for this observation. Although a recent study was unable to detect leptin receptor in the ovine placenta (11), an earlier study reported placental leptin receptors, leading to the suggestion that these receptors mediated the direct uptake of maternal leptin into fetal blood (2, 4). Alternatively, induced maternal hyperglycemia, by continuous glucose infusion, causes fetal hyperglycemia and mild fetal hyperinsulinemia. After 14 days of hyperglycemia, the fetus showed a significant increase in leptin mRNA expression in adipose tissue (5). Likewise, induced maternal hypoglycemia, by continuous insulin infusion, produces fetal hypoglycemia and subsequent hypoinsulinemia as well as a sharp decline in leptin mRNA expression in fat around the time when hypoinsulinemia begins to appear (5). Further experiments showed that hyperglycemia with an insulin clamp - to test the effects of glucose independently of insulin - did not affect leptin mRNA expression while hyperinsulinemia with a glucose clamp did produce a rapid increase in leptin mRNA levels in white adipose tissue (5). The results from these experiments indicate that hyperglycemia produces an increase in leptin mRNA only by inducing hyperinsulinemia and has no direct effect itself. Maternal overnutrition leading to maternal and fetal hyperglycemia may therefore also act in this manner to mediate increased fetal leptin concentration. The consequences of these amplified plasma leptin levels are uncertain, but may have one of two opposing effects. Because leptin represses neuropeptide Y function, increased leptin may decrease fetal amniotic fluid intake, affecting gastrointestinal tract development, and promote energy reducing behaviors in the neonate (5). Conversely, fetal leptin may actually make fetal insulin more sensitive to glucose usage, stimulating cell growth, and may also be mitogenic itself, leading to fetal body weight gain (5). It remains undetermined which leptin response predominates in the fetus and neonate and requires further investigation for clarification. Independently of any leptin-mediated effects, glucose directly promotes moderate fetal fat mass deposition. Insulin does not produce the same effects, indicating that glucose acts through the insulin-independent glucose transporter GLUT 1, and not the insulin-dependent transporter GLUT 4 (8). Remarkably, leptin and fat mass increases do not manifest if the mother is only overfed in late pregnancy, after the final stage of rapid fetal growth (9). Restriction of maternal diet early in pregnancy has been strongly linked to an increase in obesity, heart disease, and hypertension. The specific mechanisms that produce this effect are still unclear, but seem to involve interactions between leptin, glucose, and insulin like growth factors (IGF) I and II (11). Offspring born to mothers that were temporarily under nutrient restriction early in pregnancy are larger and have more adipose tissue mass and increased levels of IGF-I and IGF-II mRNA and growth hormone receptor mRNA in the liver. These hormones may act cooperatively to alter gluconeogenesis permanently, and up-regulation of the IGF receptors may stimulate adipose tissue growth, which may increase the risk for future obesity (1, 11). Under the same conditions, ewes exhibit lower circulating leptin; since maternal and fetal leptin levels correspond positively, one would expect fetal leptin levels to be lower also, although this was not observed in this study (11). Severe maternal undernutrition can also lead to fetal hypoglycemia and hypoinsulinemia, which depresses fetal leptin levels, as discussed previously. In rats, juvenile offspring of mothers that were undernourished throughout pregnancy present hyperphagia, hyperinsulinemia, hyperleptinemia, hypertension, and obesity, metabolic deficiencies suggested to be induced in utero (6). The persistence of hyperphagia, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperleptinemia points to both leptin and insulin resistance since normally high levels of insulin and leptin would depress appetite. High caloric diets greatly magnified these phenomena (6). Although none of the ovine studies examined offspring at juvenile stage, it is reasonable to believe that they would show similar symptoms. In the offspring of undernourished mothers, low ovine fetal leptin levels would also cause postnatal hyperphagia and aggravate the pre-programmed metabolic abnormalities. As with overnutrition, undernutrition in late gestation differs from that in early or mid gestation. Moderate nutrient deprivation late in pregnancy causes maternal glucose to decrease while maternal and fetal leptin do not change (10, 11). This can be partially explained by the level of nutrient deprivation in the studies. Undernutrition initially stimulates adaptations to maintain the fetal glucose supply such as a decrease in maternal insulin sensitivity, and if the undernutrition is moderate enough then these maternal metabolic actions compensate adequately for the fetus and leptin levels remain steady (10). Additionally, the notable difference between the time-dependent effects of maternal nutrition, with respect to both overnutrition and undernutrition, may be due to greater fetal glucose requirements at the end of gestation (11). A consensus on the exact effects of maternal nutrition on offspring endocrine systems and future health remains to be determined, but some key points in the current field have been identified. Excessive or limited maternal nutrition most likely induces metabolic changes in utero, largely through leptin, with significant health and endocrinological consequences resulting from this 'fetal programming.' In particular, maternal undernutrition has been linked to offspring at increased risk of obesity, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, etc. Additionally, the timing of the maternal nutrition disturbance is significant, with the greatest fetal effects seen as a result of early to mid maternal over- or undernutrition. The implications this field has for society are vastly importance since cardiovascular and obesity-linked diseases cost billions of dollars a year. With the knowledge that so many adult diseases probably derive from metabolic problems initiated in gestation, devoting more resources to pre-natal course could be immensely more cost-efficient and disease preventive in the long run.

BIO.G0.05.1,Mn (III) TPPS4: A Metallophorphryin Used for Tumor Identification in MRI,Biology,Report,"From as early as 1948, scientists have studied the potential of porphryins and metalloporphyrins in cancer detection and therapy. For reasons unknown then, these compounds had high affinities for neoplasms (tumors) when injected into mice.1 In fact, porphyrin concentration was highest in and near necrotic areas (unprogrammed cell death). The potential for metalloporphyrins in tumor identification was further uncovered with the effects of paramagnetic substances on proton relaxation time of surrounding tissues.2 While X-ray imaging is used for bony, dense structures, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), an application of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, has been used with soft tissues for decades. The magnetic moments of paramagnetic species such as MnTPPS4 significantly enhance MRI signal in the soft tissues to which it is bound, making it an optimal contrast agent. MnTPPS4 can be synthesized by heating meso-tetra(4-sulfonatophenyl)porphine (H2TPPS4) and manganese (II) acetate in acetic acid under reflux for 8 hours.4 Air bubbling through the reflux solution oxidizes Mn(II) to Mn(III). The presence of MnTPPS4 and disappearance of H2TPPS4 can be confirmed with UV spectroscopy: Figure 1: Absorption spectra of equimolar aqueous solutions of H2TPPS4 (full line) and MnTPPS4 (dotted line) 2 Additionally, the absorbance maxima of Mn(III)TPPS4 occur at 465, 561, and 593 nm, while the absorbance maxima of Mn(II)TPPS4 are at 434, 572, and 612 nm.3 While the synthesis of MnTPPS4 has been documented since the 1960's, and it is commercially available, it is a very polar molecule and is thus often contaminated with un-identified by- product. Bockhorst and coworkers4 proposed an optimized purification method: washing the product multiple times with hot acetic acid, then hot ethanol, and dissolving in aqueous Na2CO3. The solution is then filtered, acidified with HCl, centrifuged and dried; this procedure is done twice. Finally, drying over KOH in a desiccator gives the desired product, a dark green, metallic solid, at 98% purity. Tetraphenylporphine sulfonate, TPPS4 can be synthesized by heating meso-tetraphenylporphine with concentrated sulfuric acid over a steam bath for 4h.5 Meso-tetraphenylporphine can be prepared by refluxing pyrrole and benzaldehyde in propionic acid.6 Figure 2: Mn(III)-tetrakis(4-sulfonatophenyl)porphin (MnTPPS4) Mol. Formula: MnC44H24N4O12S4ClNa4, MW=1111.3 g/mol * *the ligands on the product from the synthesis described are SO3H instead of SO3 - Na+ Tetraphenylsulfonyl is a hydrophilic water-soluble porphryin with a highly developed �-conjugation system. Its Mn(III) complex has been extensively studied as an MRI contrast agent. Mn(III) is a high spin d4 transition metal ion that has four unpaired electrons; it is thus paramagnetic. The geometry of the molecule is square planar, with the Mn(III) chelated by the four nitrogen atoms of a porphine that has four attached sulfonyl groups. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance is the observation of the frequency at which magnetic nuclei in molecules come into resonance with an externally applied electromagnetic field. The signal depends on a variety of factors, including field strength and concentration. It follows that Magnetic Resonance Imaging is essentially a measure of proton density. When the magnetic field varies linearly across an object, the signal intensity is proportional to proton concentration. Tumor identification is possible because of differences in relaxation rates of bulk water of normal tissues and tumors.3 However, the difference is usually no more than 2-3 fold. T1, longitudinal relaxation time, is the taken by a proton to align with the external magnetic field. As referenced by Runge and coworkers,7 longitudinal relation rate (1/T1) can be described by the following equation: where � is the viscosity of the solvent, k is the Boltzman constant, N is the concentration of ions, T is the absolute temperature, and � is the gyromagnetic ratio for the hydrogen nucleus. The variable of interest is �, the effective magnetic moment. As the equation shows, spin lattice rate (another name for 1/T1) is directly proportional to the square of �. Paramagnetic species alter the local magnetic field to enhance proton relaxation (spin-lattice T1 and spin-spin relaxation T2 rates) of neighboring nuclei. T2, transverse magnetization time, is also tissue specific; it depends on the exchange of energy and interaction of spins with neighboring nuclei. In essence, T2 measures decay of magnetization perpendicular to the main magnetic field. Through a complex set of equations, it can be determined that paramagnetic species also shortens T2.7 This is unfavorable, as a decrease in T2 weakens signal.7 An optimal contrast agent would therefore reduce T1, increasing spin lattice relaxation rate, without significantly compromising T2. In the presence of an externally applied magnetic field, the magnetic moments of MnTPPS4 that were previously randomly aligned become preferentially aligned with the field.7 This local magnetic field produced by the paramagnetic species shortens T1 and T2 of surrounding protons in the tumor. This paramagnetic effect decreases with distance: where r is the mean distance from paramagnetic center to the proton.3 Thus, an effective paramagnetic contrast agent should include a high spin, metal ion with a large magnetic moment and easily accessible axial coordination sites. Chen and coworkers3 demonstrated that spin lattice relaxation rate (1/T1) increases linearly with concentration of various metallo-TPPS4 complexes. Of these, the slope is steepest with Mn(III) compared to various other ions and metallo-TPPS4 complexes (Figure 2). It is the most effective in enhancing proton relaxation due to its four unpaired electrons and ability to coordinate axial ligands. While Mn(II) would have five unpaired electrons and theoretically induce an even shorter T1, Mn(II)TPPS4 is not as stable in solution as Mn(III)TPPS4 because it is readily oxidized. A variety of paramagnetic species have been considered for use as MRI contrast agents - both free and chelated metal ions. Aside from enhancing relaxation rates as determined in vitro, toxicity, stability in human plasma and at various pH, clearance from blood, and tissue distribution must also be taken into account when examining an MRI contrast agent. NMR contrast media can also be classified by method of uptake into body: oral, intravenous, inhalational. Furthermore, blood transport bio distribution and relaxation efficiency are related to differences in binding and aggregation properties of the metalloporphyrin that Figure 2: Spin lattice relaxation rate (l/Tr) of water as a function of concentration of metal ion or metallo-TPPS4 complex.

BIO.G0.06.1,Global Reproductive Strategies of Tursiops and Stenella (Family Delphinidae),Biology,Report,"Generally, females make a larger investment toward future generations than males. Not only is production of eggs more expensive than production of sperm, but males essentially have an unlimited supply of sperm while females are born with a limited number of eggs (Campbell and Reece 2002). In placental mammals, the female carries the offspring in her uterus until it is ready to be born, at a great cost to her. If parental care is involved, the male is not involved. Therefore, the limiting factor for the fitness of mammalian females is expected to be the number of pregnancies they can successfully carry and the number of offspring they can successfully raise. The fitness of mammalian males, who, in contrast to females, expend very little energy on reproduction, is expected to be limited by the number of females they can successfully mate with. Females, therefore, should be choosy about which males they mate with and males should compete over opportunities to mate with the females (Freeman and Herron 2004). The different limiting factors for males and females usually results in either promiscuous or polygynous mating systems. In a promiscuous mating system, males attempt to mate with as many females as possible and do not form any sort of bond with the female. Females also try to mate with as many males as possible. Different males will have very different degrees of success. In a polygynous mating system, one male mates with many different females, but forms a longer bond with the females than in a promiscuous system (Ricklefs 2001). In both of these systems, males compete for access to females, and females mate with the male that can best compete. Members of the family delphinidae, which includes dolphins, killer whales, pilot whales, and many other species, are viviparous mammals. Therefore, it is expected that females will generally be choosy, males will be competitive, and the mating systems will probably be either promiscuous or polygynous. Delphinids are usually sexually dimorphic-males are generally larger than the females and may have a different shape (Animal Diversity Web, 1999 and Tolley et al. 1995). In general, males may be larger than females if male-male competition is an important selecting factor in reproduction. If males combat for access to the females, larger males will have an advantage, and be more likely to pass their genes that code for large size on to the next generation. However, because delphinidae encompasses so many genera and has a worldwide distribution (Animal Diversity Web, 1999), different mating strategies exist and male-male competition is not the sole determining factor for a successful mating for Stenella and Tursiops . The mating systems of the genus Tursiops (which includes bottlenose dolphins) and the genus Stenella (which includes spinner dolphins) have been studied more than many other genera, due to their tolerance of people and relatively easier access. Therefore, the focus of this review will be only on those two genera. Delphinids use different reproductive strategies in different parts of the world. Major studies of the delphinid mating system have been done in Shark Bay, Western Australia (Connor et al. 1996 and Kr�tzen et al. 2003); Sarasota, Florida (Owen at al. 2002 and Tolley et al. 1995); and in the eastern Pacific, along the coasts of Mexico and South America (Perrin and Mesnick 2003). Globally, males and females preferentially associate together when the females are reproductively active (Connor et al. 1996 and Owen et al. 2002), although males may interact with females even if the female is pregnant or not in estrous (Connor et al. 1996 and Owen et al. 2002). Dolphins in Western Australia were mostly polygynous, although the males exhibited two alternative strategies of controlling females. Dolphins in the eastern Pacific showed a gradient of polygyny in the eastern spinner population to promiscuity in the whitebelly spinner population. Dolphins in Sarasota may either be polygynous or promiscuous. A major limitation is that all of the studies focused mainly on the male reproductive strategy. Female choice may also be important in dolphins, and further study focusing on females is necessary. The mating system of dolphins in Shark Bay seems to be polygynous because a few males mate with a group of females in a semi-long term bond. Male bottlenose dolphins interact aggressively with females using a herding technique to form consortships. Females are generally unreceptive to this herding, even if they are reproductively active. In order to capture a female, males will accelerate toward her, and control her using vocal popping noises and aggressive actions such as striking her with their flukes, charging at her, and jerking their heads at her. The females will usually try to escape, but are generally recaptured. Males use two alternative reproductive strategies in order to herd females: 1) Males form long-term first order alliances with 1-2 other males in order to herd females (Connor et al. 1996). Two of these alliances may combine (a second order alliance), forming groups of 4-6 males, which gives those males a better chance to steal females away from another alliance and to protect the females they have from theft by other male alliances (Kr�tzen et al. 2003). 2) Alternatively, males may combine into super-alliances of up to 14 males, which makes them even more effective at both stealing and guarding females (Kr�tzen et al. 2003). In the first reproductive strategy, males in either first or second order alliances were more closely related than would be expected by chance (Kr�tzen et al. 2003). Males may form alliances not only to increase their chances of successfully subduing females, but also because these alliances increase their inclusive fitness. By helping a close relative monopolize a single female, a male dolphin will benefit indirectly if his relative mates with the female. Although one male dolphin may not mate with the female, some of his genes will be passed on to the next generation if a close relative mates with her. According to Hamilton's law, altruistic behavior will spread if the cost to the actor is low, the benefit to the recipient is high, and the actor and recipient are closely related (Freeman and Herron 2004). The cost to male dolphins for guarding a female can be high because males may fight viciously over females (Animal Diversity Web, 1999). However, because these altruistic alleles exist, the benefit of producing related offspring is apparently high enough to overcome the cost of fighting for females. In the second reproductive strategy, males were not closely related. Some males form super-alliances of about 14 individuals. The males will form first order alliances with other males of this super alliance. In contrast to the first strategy, where the alliances were stable and long term, first order alliances in the second strategy are transient and constantly changing. The males in a super-alliance are not any more closely related than would be expected by chance. The males may form these larger alliances in order to steal females away from first and second order alliances, and then compete among themselves for the opportunity to mate with the female (Kr�tzen et al. 2003). The males in super alliances do not gain any indirect fitness benefits by being in the alliance. The only benefit seems to be that the larger the alliance is, the more successful it will be at both taking and keeping females. However, the reproductive strategies of the females have not been thoroughly studied and are still only mostly speculation. Due to the fact that males can monopolize females, it appears that intrasexual selection among males is occurring in this population of dolphins (Freeman and Herron 2004). Males that can most successfully control females are most likely to mate, and pass their genes on to the next generation. However, the mating system may be more complicated than simply the male who wins the fight has the opportunity to mate with the female. There is evidence that female choice may also be a selective factor. Females may use their escape behavior as a means to test the physical fitness of the males (Connor et al.1996). By forcing the male to chase after her, she may be effectively selecting to only mate with healthy, strong males. There is also evidence that females may directly choose a mate. Researchers have observed elaborate displays by males around consorted females that suggest that females may use those displays to directly choose a mate among the males that are herding them (Connor et al.1996). In addition, there is also evidence that females willingly socialize with an alliance of males, without any agonistic behavior (Connor et al. 1996). Some males may attempt to form relationships with females in order to increase their chances of being chosen by the female, also suggesting that female choice is an important factor. The mating system is further complicated by the fact that females are not entirely monopolized by a few males. Females go into estrous several times a year, and so mate with many different males. It is unclear why females would be polyestrous, which increases the number of times they will be harassed by males. Herding of females is costly and dangerous to the females because it decreases the amount of time the female can spend foraging for food and the males can be very aggressive. A possible explanation is that, if a female is monopolized by a less desirable male during one cycle, she will have the opportunity to mate with a more desirable male during a second cycle (Connor et al.1996). It seems as if looking for the best genes is not a satisfactory explanation, especially because females may not even have a choice of mates. Females seem to usually mate with the group of males that manages to successfully capture her, which may or may not be males with the best genes. There is no guarantee that a female will be captured by a group of males with better genes during her next cycle. An alternative explanation may be that mating with many males decreases the risk of infanticide. In some primate species, the risk of infanticide by a male is less if the female has copulated with that male. The male presumably realizes that the infant may be his, and so is less aggressive towards it. It is possible that by mating with many different males, female dolphins decrease the risk of aggression by males towards their infants (Connor et al. 1996). However, there are large differences between primates and cetaceans, so it may not be accurate to describe dolphin behavior using primate studies. Both the study by Connor et al. (1996) and Kr�tzen et al. (2003) focused largely on the reproductive strategies of the males. Further study of female dolphins is necessary to fully understand the complex mating system. Studies of female sociality are necessary to see if female choice is an important part of the mating system. If female choice is important, then what kind of males do females prefer? Paternity tests of calves would reveal which males are most successful, either through male-male competition or female choice. Further studies may also answer the question of why females are polyestrous even though it is detrimental to their health. In contrast to the studies conducted in Shark Bay, Perrin and Mesnick (2003) did not directly observe dolphin behavior. Spinner dolphins live offshore, so it is difficult to study them directly. The study was instead conducted using incidentally killed spinner dolphins that had been caught in tuna nets. The weight of the epididymis + testis was compared between the eastern spinner dolphin and the whitebelly spinner dolphin, which is a hybrid of the eastern spinner and a Hawaiian spinner. The range of the whitebelly spinner is larger than the range of the eastern spinner, but the ranges of these two populations greatly overlap (Fig. 1). The whitebelly spinner dolphin and the eastern spinner dolphin were found to have a gradient of mating systems, ranging from promiscuity in the whitebelly form to polygyny in the eastern form. The whitebelly population had a greater testis + epididymis weight than the eastern population. Increased testis size can evolve if the sperm must compete. If a female mates with several males, the male who can produce the most sperm (largest testis) is most likely to successfully fertilize the female. Therefore, a large testis size is expected in a promiscuous mating system, where the female mates with many males. The whitebelly population had larger testis + epidermis weights than the eastern population, suggesting that the whitebelly dolphin mating system is more promiscuous than the spinner population. The eastern spinner showed greater sexual dimorphism than the whitebelly spinner, suggesting that the mating system of the spinner dolphin is polygynous. Sexual dimorphism is usually a result of male-male competition, which may evolve when males can control access to females or resources the females need. The largest males can control access to females, resulting in several females mating with one male (polygyny). Because the male can directly control the female, she will not mate with many other males. There is less selective pressure for more competitive sperm, so it is expected that the eastern testis + epididymis would be smaller than the whitebelly (Perrin and Mesnick 2003). However, because the dolphins were not studied directly, it is unknown how exactly the mating systems work and if the assignment of a promiscuous mating system to the whitebelly form and a polygynous mating system to the eastern form is correct. Sexual dimorphism can occur in both polygynous and promiscuous mating systems. Males in both mating systems compete to mate with as many females as possible. Competition between males facilitates the evolution of dimorphism in size, coloration, behavior, etc (Ricklefs 2001). Therefore, the conclusion by Perrin and Mesnick (2003) that the eastern spinner is polygynous because it shows greater sexual dimorphism is not necessarily true. Their argument is strengthened by the congruent data from epididymis + testis size that suggests the whitebelly form is more promiscuous than the eastern form. However, direct study of the dolphins would be the most convincing way to confirm that the mating system assignment is correct. Perrin and Mesnick (2003) discuss and dismiss several alternative hypotheses and confounding factors that could account for the difference in epididymis + testis weight between the eastern form and the whitebelly form. Whitebelly dolphins are, on average, about 5 cm longer than eastern dolphins (Perrin and Mesnick 2003). Therefore, larger epididymis + testis weight of whitebelly dolphins may only be an incidental result of their larger overall size. However, size does not appear to be a confounding factor because whitebelly epididymis + testis weight was still larger than eastern epididymis + testis weight for dolphins of the same length (Perrin and Mesnick 2003). Another possible confounding factor could be that whitebelly and eastern dolphins reach sexual maturity at different ages or times of the year. Juvenile eastern dolphins-which would have a smaller epididymis + testis weight because they are not sexually mature-may have been compared against adult whitebelly dolphins in the study, leading to skewed results. Perrin and Mesnick (2003) controlled for this by limiting the study to adult males whose right testis + epididymis weight was at least 88g. Testis + epididymis weight is, on average, 88g at spermatogenesis, so all of the males should have been sexually mature. Samples were also collected over every month of the year, allowing for different reproductive seasons. Size and time of reproduction should therefore not be confounding factors, and it is probably an accurate conclusion that whitebelly epididymis + testis weight is larger than eastern epididymis + testis weight. Another possible alternative explanation for the difference in epididymis + testis weight could be a greater chase-and-capture pressure from tuna fishermen on the eastern spinners. A greater chase-and-capture pressure may have a depressive effect on male reproductive function, thereby causing the epididymis + testis weight to be smaller. Perrin and Mesnick (2003) reject this possible explanation because annual pregnancy rates in the two populations are comparable, which would not be expected if the eastern spinner male reproductive system was depressed. They also found that a comparable percentage of whitebelly spinners (17%) and eastern spinners (22%) were accidentally captured in nets. It appears that there is not greater chase-and-capture pressure on the eastern spinner dolphin than on the whitebelly spinner dolphin. Direct study of both the whitebelly and eastern spinner dolphins should be conducted in order to confirm Perrin and Mesnick's (2003) conclusions and to see how males and females interact. Are the spinner dolphins similar to the Shark Bay bottlenose dolphins? Shark Bay males form alliances that aggressively herd females. Are interactions between male and female spinner dolphins also agonistic? Do male spinner dolphins form alliances in order to herd females (especially in the polygynous eastern population), and if so, are they related to their fellow alliance members? Male bottlenose dolphins in Sarasota normally bond with another male during their teens for a long-term, stable relationship, but rarely associate with other males. Owen et al. (2002) found no evidence of pair bonds combining to find second order alliances or super-alliances, as was found in Shark Bay dolphins (Connor et al. 1996 and Kr�tzen et al. 2003). Dolphins in Shark Bay are smaller than dolphins in Sarasota (Tolley et al. 1995), and a social system of limited interaction between unpaired males may have evolved in order to lessen the occurrence of agonistic interactions between males (Owen et al. 2002). The larger a male is, the more potential he has to injure another male. Injuries between Sarasota males fighting over females may be more severe than injuries to Shark Bay males, facilitating the evolution of less interaction between Sarasota males. Sarasota dolphins are sexually dimorphic (Tolley et al. 1995) suggesting that the mating system is either polygynous or promiscuous. Males do not possess ornate secondary sexual characters; instead differences between the sexes are size related. Males are larger than females, have larger locomotor muscles, and have larger flukes and dorsal fins. The increased size of the flukes and dorsal fins and locomotor muscles may give the males greater propulsion, better maneuvering, and better thermoregulation which could be used either to chase females or in fights with other males over females (Tolley et al. 1995). Tolley et al. (1995) cite a study by Trivers (1985), which suggests that Sarasota dolphins may be promiscuous. Trivers (1985) found that moderate sexual dimorphism suggests a mating system of males competing for access to dispersed females, instead of a more polygynous system where the largest males are able to monopolize females. The dolphins in Sarasota exhibited moderate sexual dimorphism, suggesting that the mating system may be promiscuous. However, adult male dolphins associate with potentially reproductive females during the breeding season; subsequently, males and females may form long-term bonds, which are not seen in promiscuous mating systems (Ricklefs 2001). Compared to the Shark Bay male-female interactions, the interactions during the breeding season between males and females in Sarasota were shorter, less stable, and less agonistic. However, male interactions with potentially reproductive females during the non-breeding season were more stable than during the breeding season. Males may form affiliative relationships with females during the non-breeding season in order to increase their chance of being chosen by the female during the breeding season (Owen et al. 2002). However, Owen et al. (2002) did not report the nature of the interactions between males and females, only how often males associated with potentially reproductive and non-reproductive females. The time of interaction between males and females was shorter than for the Shark Bay dolphins, suggesting that males in Sarasota do not guard mates for long, so the relationship is probably less antagonistic. In addition, the fact that males attempt to form relationships with females when they are not reproductively active suggests that female choice, and not solely male-male competition, is important. It is difficult to conclude from these two studies if the mating system of Sarasota dolphins is polygynous, promiscuous, or possibly something else. Evidence is supported for both a polygynous and a promiscuous mating system. It might be possible that two alternative strategies exist in this population, such as in the eastern Pacific spinner dolphins. Research comparing testis size for two different populations in Sarasota may be helpful in determining if the mating system is promiscuous. The mating systems of Tursiops and Stenella are mostly either promiscuous or polygynous. Western Australia dolphins tend to be polygynous. Eastern Pacific dolphins may either be polygynous (the eastern form) or promiscuous (the whitebelly form). It is inconclusive whether Sarasota dolphins are promiscuous or polygynous. Male-male competition appeared to be an important selective factor globally; female choice may also be an important selecting factor, but further research focusing more on females needs to be conducted in order to fully understand the mating system. Fig 1. Distribution of the eastern spinner is shown in the top picture. Distribution of the whitebelly spinner is shown in the bottom picture. The eastern spinner's distribution is generally more northern than the whitebelly spinner's distribution, but the ranges overlap (Perrin and Mesnick 2003).

BIO.G0.07.1,Complementation Between Histidine-Requiring Mutants of Saccharomyces Cerevisiae,Biology,Report,"Complementation experiments test for function. If two mutations separately produce a phenotype but when combined into a diploid/heterozygote state correct the defects of the other and recapitulate the wild type phenotype, then they are said to complement each other. Two mutations are noncomplementary if the mutant phenotype persists when they are combined. The organism used in this experiment, Saccharomyces cerevisiae which can form diploid as well as haploid cells, allows for the use of complementation analysis. Complementation tests provide information about the genetic location of a particular mutation. Complementing mutations are on different genes and noncomplementing mutations are within the same gene. It is also possible to distinguish between intergenic complementation (as described above) and intragenic complementation where two mutations are found within the same gene. Generally mutations within the same gene would not revert back to wild type; however, if they are two different mutations within the same gene then the wild type phenotype can be observed. Intragenic complementation is characterized by slower growth and reduced activity or heat stability of the affected enzyme (Jeyabalan 57). This experiment used complementation assays to find out which gene in the yeast histidine biosynthesis pathway a particular unknown mutation is located and also to observe intergenic versus intragenic complementation. See the Genetics 306 Lab Manual for details of the procedure (Jeyabalan 60-63). Refer to Table 1 for known A and � strain mutations and note that A and � have secondary auxotrophic mutations in different genes. If complementation occurred between mutant strains then growth would be present at the diploid mating junctions on the minimal medium indicating that the wild type histidine synthesizing pathway was restored. Table 1: Known A and � strain mutations After one and two days of incubation, growth was evident at all mating junctions on the minimal medium except �2/A2, �2/A3, �2/A4; �4/A6; �5/A2, �5/A3, �5/A4; and �6/A3, �6/A4. On the fifth day growth appeared at �2/A2 and �5/A2. Confluent lines of growth were present along A1, �3, and �6. A few small colonies were present at the �2/A4 and �5/A4 mating intersection after five days of incubation. See Figure 1 for a picture depiction of the growth on the minimal medium and minimal medium plus histidine plate. Growth was present at all of the mating junctions on the minimal plus histidine plate. Confluent growth was found along A1 and �3 lines. Figure 1: Results of A and � matings on minimal and minimal plus hisitidine medium plates All of the matings should grow on the minimal plus histidine control plate because the different secondary auxotrophic requirements for each strain A and � would complement the other in the diploid state. This plate was used to ensure matings were efficient and that the second auxotrophic mutations were present. The results show growth at all mating junctions indicating that the correct matings occurred; however, there was confluent growth along A1, �3, and �6. This could happen if the strain lost its second auxotrophic requirement so these results indicate that A1, �3, and �6 are no longer trp-, ade-, and ade-, respectively. The growth patterns on minimal medium were used to generate Table 2. Growth at a mating junction on the minimal plate implies that the wild type histidine synthesizing pathway was restored due to complementation between the two histidine mutations in each strain. Complementation between the two strain's secondary auxotrophic mutations must have also occurred if growth is present on the minimal plate. Table 2: Table of complementation results after one, two, and five days of incubationand the genetic locus of � strain mutations Plus and minus signs designate growth or lack of growth, respectively, at mating junctions *Expected results are in black and observed results are in red The genetic locus of the histidine mutation in each � strain was determined by first identifying the mating(s) that did not complement, that is, where no cells grew at the junction on minimal medium. The known mutation in the A strain at that junction would indicate the gene that is mutated in the � strain because mutations at the same genetic locus do not complement each other. Using this logic, the �4 strain did not complement with A6 indicating that it has a mutation in the his1 gene, Table 2. After one and two days of incubation the expected non-complementing diploids for the �2, �5, and �6 strains were A2, A3, and A4. The common mutation in these A strains is his4C which specifies that the mutation in �2, �5, and �6 is in the his4C gene. However, since his4C2 in A2 and his4C3 in A3 are closely linked it is not possible to determine the exact genetic location within the his4C gene the � mutations are in after only two days of incubation. After five days of incubation, �2 and �5 complemented with A2. Such slow growth is characteristic of intragenic complementation and indicates that the mutated gene in �2 and �5 is not his4C2 but could be his4C3 or another mutation within the his4C gene. Since �6 did not complement after five days (expected results) the mutation could be within hisC2 or 3 or another his4C gene. Notably, the observed results show that �6 did complement A2. A possible explanation is that this mating junction became contaminated with a complementary strain during the plating procedure. The expected results show that the �3 strain should not complement with A5 indicating that it has a mutation in his5, but the observed results show growth at this junction. Figure 1 shows that confluent growth was along the �3 line in this minimal medium which could only happen if this strain lost both of its auxotrophic mutations, his and ade, and reverted to wild type. The A1 strain also shows a full line of growth on this plate indicating that it lost both histidine and tryptophan mutations. The genetic event responsible for the few small colonies at the intersections of the noncomplementing strains �2/A4 and �5/A4 could be mutational reversion or suppression. The histidine and other auxotrophic mutations could revert back to their wild type forms, or a second site could be mutated which also reverts back to the wild type phenotype. This experiment used complementation analysis to map the genetic locus of five unknown histidine mutations, Table 2. Intergenic and intragenic complementation was observed. The observed results varied from the expected results by showing confluent growth on minimal and minimal plus histidine medium which confer information about which mutations have been lost in the strains. Finally, mutational reversion was noted after five days of growth at the junction of several noncomplementing strains.

BIO.G0.09.1,Nest Selection In Weaver Birds,Biology,Report,"All bird species reproduce through the use of a cleidoic egg, a structure which utilizes a hard shell to protect the developing embryo inside. This egg must be placed in an appropriate environment in order to grow correctly and hatch into a healthy chick (Hansell, 2000). The vulnerability and special requirements of the egg led to the construction of special locations to place the eggs which eventually led to the current nests that are created by today's birds. These nests can range from simple mounds of dirt where decaying refuse is placed inside in order to maintain a suitable temperature for the developing eggs, to the simple cup shaped nests commonly put together by many species of birds, and to the elaborate woven nests that weavers create. The type of nest required depends on several factors such as the level of dependency of the offspring, level of safety from common predators, protection from the elements, and mate selection. This leads to the main question of the paper of what in fact makes a nest suitable for a certain species of bird, specifically Village and Baya Weavers. The level of development for a newly hatched chick is one of the main determining factors in deciding what kind of nest a bird needs to create. This level of development can be ranked to eight classes according to Mike Hansell (Table 1). Stages of development range from extreme independence to total dependence with varying degrees in between. The majority of birds in the wild, almost 70% of all species produce offspring which are stage 8, or altricial type 2 (Hansell, 2000). These naked and defenseless chicks need a protective home in a location where it is out of reach from predators and shielded from the elements. Table 1: Eight Classes of chick development. (Table taken from Hansell, 2000) Another important consideration for the success of a nest is the potential location that is selected for the nest. Several factors are included into this such as a specific location on a tree, the type of tree used, thickness of the branches and other variables all playing a critical role in determining the odds of success. Obviously a nest affixed to a thick branch is more secure and can withstand the wind better thereby lowering the chance it may get blown down, yet at the same time the larger branch increases the possibility a predator such as a snake can then enter the nest and eat the eggs. A field study done by Suhel Quader (2006) analyzed these various attributes over several years with nesting Baya Weavers (Ploceus philippinus). His first study found that there was a strong correlation between fledgling success rate and date of clutch completion which suggests that there is an optimal time for building a nest and starting a brood (Figure 1). Figure 1: Proportion of Successful Nests Relative to Date of Clutch Completion Overall through the experiment Quader found that fledgling success rate was highest on nests that were attached to thorny branches, high off the ground, and on thick branches. Since nest success went up with increasing branch size this suggests that the stability of the nest is more important than the increase in predation that such a nest would experience from being on a thicker branch and therefore more accessible. Another important thing to note is that fledgling success increased with the use of finer fibers where the nest is possibly more insulated from the elements and has a stability advantage over nests constructed of course fibers. The color of the nest should be an important and easily assessable factor in determining the quality of a nest by a male for construction and a female for choosing an appropriate nest. The ideal color should optimally be green, which is the color of fresh foliage and the color brown should be selected against since it indicates that the vegetation is dead. If this is the case then we should optimally see a selection by males for green nest building materials and a strong preference for green nests over brown ones by the females in nest selection. Nicholas and Elsie Collias performed a study on a group of Village Weaver birds, (Ploceus cucullatus), where they separated a population of young birds and created two different groups which were then deprived of normal nesting materials for certain amounts of time. A control group of normally reared weaver birds was used in order to compare the results with the weavers that were completely deprived of anything closely resembling nesting materials. They then tested the birds by using uniformly sized materials of varying colors, from green to white and then counted the number of times each color was selected. This experiment was performed on six consecutive days while the birds were seven months old for the deprived birds. The results show that even on the first day of seeing these objects green was picked more often than the other colors and especially on the final days of the studies where green was the popular choice 79 percent of the time (Table 2). The control birds also showed an immediate preference for green under similar testing procedures. Table 2: Selection of nest materials of different colors by four male weavers (Table taken from Collias & Collias, 1984) This innate preference for selecting green nest building materials makes sense for males since the green vegetation should be the most flexible and workable which is required in order to weave a complex nest. The idea of color selection also applies to females when choosing nests and was tested via an experiment by C.H. Jacobs, N.E. Collias, and J.T. Fujimoto (1978). They tested the response that females had to nests of different color by painting nests either brown or green. A fresh nest created in the wild begins green and lasts about two days before it begins to yellow and then eventually turns brown approximately a week later as the vegetation dies. Ideally the females should pick the nest that provides the safest environment for her eggs which should be the freshest and best constructed nest. Since older nests have spent more time in the sun and weather their strength should be somewhat compromised compared to a fresh nest (Jacobs et al., 1978), influencing the female to pick the newest and greenest nest that she can find. If this is the case then the results should show that females pick the green nests preferentially over the brown nests, regardless if it is a nest painted green versus a normal nest. The data in Table 3 suggests that the paint used had little effect on the females choosing nests and there was almost no difference in choosing between a normal nest and a green painted nest, whereas there was a slight preference for a green color over brown. The results from this experiment show that the females seem to visit nests based on the amount of displays that the male does at any given nest instead of picking a nest based on color. The males in turn display at all newly built nests equally independent of what color it was painted which leads to the fact that the once the female accepts the nest temporarily she uses some other method to determine if it is adequate, such as quality of the weave and the display of male (Jacobs et al., 1978). Table 3: Female nest acceptances both temporary and permanent The manor in which birds select their nests can be identified as somewhat of a common sense approach as in placing it in an area that is safest from harm, whether it be nature of predators, yet it can also these simple answers can be more complex than they first appear. The study with nest location by Quader showed us that there are pros and cons to virtually all locations such as if you nest on a thorny tree you will reduce the amount of predation from snakes, yet the predation from mice ends up equaling that of snakes since they also have a safe place to live. The study also showed the importance of things that aren't so obvious such as an optimal time exists for building a nest and starting a brood to achieve maximum survival of fledglings. This then leads to the question of how birds decide to place their nests in certain locations and if this is a learned behavior or just an innate ability such as the use of color selection among Village Weavers. Male weavers are born with a predisposition towards the color green because they know that is the optimal color of material to build their nests. Overall I find it fascinating that these amazing birds are able to build such complex nests with essentially trial and error and are able to use risk management to find the ideal places for their nests and I believe this will provide researchers questions to study for years to come.

BIO.G0.11.3,Fungal Eye Infections Due to ReNu MoistureLoc,Biology,Report,"Numerous types of fungi are able to infect the eye, including Fusarium, Aspergillus, Curvularia, and Candida (4). The fungus responsible for the recent outbreaks of keratitis (infection of the cornea) due to ReNu MoistureLoc use is thought to be Fusarium species. There are multiple species within the genus Fusarium, with Fusarium solani being known as the most prevalent and dangerous variety. Fusarium is commonly found on plants or in the soil in warm, humid regions around the world. Fusarium is a type of filamentous fungus, which means that it contains hyphae. A hypha is a long, branching, tube-like filament which may composes the majority of tissue in a fungus(1). When hyphae bundle together, a mycellium is formed. The mycellium functions to feed, grow, and eventually produce a reproductive structure (e.g., mushroom). A fungus starts out as a spore, and as it divides, cells making up hyphae are generated and grow outward in a thread-like fashion. Unlike normal cell division, hyphae grow by lengthening the tips on the ends, and when the proper length is reached, a new division known as a septum is formed between the old cell and the new cell. The same method can be used to make branches. Although there are walls dividing the boundaries of the cells, cytoplasm is shared between the cells. The movement of cytoplasm throughout the hyphae is known as cytoplasmic streaming (10). This allows nutrients to be shared along the entire fungus. Hyphae are initially composed of haploid cells, but if the hyphae of one fungus joins the hyphae from another fungus of the same species, they may fuse and form multinucleate cells. In context of Fusarium keratitis, the hyphae from the fungus may protrude through lesions in the cornea to gain access to the inside of the cornea. If it can get past the primary defenses, such as the skin or other mucosal associated lymphatic tissue (SALT and MALT respectively) tissue, then it can cause an infection. However the SALT and MALT tissues are reasonably effective at keeping Fusarium out of the body. Lesions in the cornea could be caused by physical damage (e.g., small particles in the air, plant matter) or by improper care for contact lenses. Treatments for fungi are limited because they share very similar DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis pathways to humans (4). Once the fungus gains access inside the cornea, it may grow and infiltrate other areas of the eye. The cornea has two main defenses against pathogens:1) Langerhans cells and 2) immunoglobulins (1). Langerhans cells are mainly found on the outer regions of the cornea. The langerhans cells are used to phagocytose recognized pathogens, and then present the digested fragments to the stroma of the cornea. They may also recognize antibodies or complement factors which have opsonized an antigen, flagging it for phagocytosis. In the case of fungal infections, complement factors will not work because the cell wall protects the cell-membrane of the fungus (1). After digestion, the expressed epitopes can be recognized by B-cells or T-cells with complementary receptors. This could trigger an immune response which culminates in inflammation of the cornea. Inflammation triggers the recruitment of natural killer cells (NK cells), leukocytes, and other lymphocytes to the site of infection. When the langerhans cells phagocytose an antigen, they mature into dendritic cells by traveling to nearby lymph nodes. They then migrate to the corneal stroma where they can release cytokines or other inflammatory mediators. Cytokines released include IL-1, IL-6, IL-12, and TNF-alpha (textbook). IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-alpha are all synergistic with each other. They cause the release of acute phase proteins from the liver, and activate T-cells, B-cells, or inflammatory cells. IL-12 functions to activate NK cells and also causes the proliferation of TH1-cells. This will lead to the eventual increased production of IFN-�. Taken together, a cell-mediated response seems to be highly favored. The second defense consists of the immunoglobulins concentrated in the corneal stroma which have been secreted by plasma B-cells. On the surface of the cornea is a layer of mucous glycoprotein in association with glycocalyx, a network of polysaccharides (1). Immunoglobulin A (IgA), a major class of antibodies associated with serum and bodily secretions, is linked with these layers of mucous glycoproteins. IgA is essential as part of the defense against specific fungus antigens. Immunoglobulins not only attach to the surfaces of fungi marking them for extermination, but also neutralize dangerous mycotoxins released by the fungi. Unique to infections involving Fusarium is the lack of most granulocytes, also known as polymorphonuclear leukocytes, during inflammation (1). This class of leukocytes includes the neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils. These cells function to release enzymes or oxygen radicals to destroy foreign antigen. Basophils and eosinophils secrete Type II cytokines (IL-4 or IL-5 respectively) and tend to stimulate humoral responses within the body (textbook). Thus, it makes sense that there is an absence of humoral-mediated responses in the body. It has been suggested that these leukocytes are kept away from the eye as a defense mechanism to prevent hazardous inflammation which could damage the eye. The primary method of dealing with fungal infections happens to be cell-mediated. Neutrophils and monocytes are very effective against the hyphae of Fusarium (1). These cells migrate to sites of infection, and use reactive oxygen species or enzymes to kill ingested organisms. They are attracted to the sites of infection by the Type I cytokines, IFN-� and G-CSF, which are secreted by TH1-cells or NK cells and fibroblasts or monocytes respectively (1). These two cytokines greatly enhance the functioning of the neutrophils and monocytes in the eye. Monocytes can also secrete IL-1 to stimulate T-cell activation and promote B-cell clonal expansion and maturation. The important area needed for all of these responses can be found within the protective epithelium of the conjunctiva, the membrane covering the sclera and lining the inside of eyelids (12). The conjunctiva is likely to become inflamed during infection. Lymphoid tissue can be found in this area, and houses the colonies of B-cells and T-cells. B-cells here undergo maturation after being exposed to antigen presented by langerhans cells. The B-cells then migrate to nearby lymph nodes to proliferate into plasma cells. The mature cells then return to the conjunctiva or go to the blood marrow to produce antibodies. If in the eye, IgA will be secreted (4). T-cells are also stimulated by the antigen presented by langerhans cells or B-cells (via MHC II). Helper T-cells similarly migrate nearby lymph nodes to mature, and then return to the conjunctiva in order to release cytokines to activate leukocytes or provide co-stimulation for the functioning of other lymphocytes. The majority of fungal keratitis occurs after trauma to the cornea. The early symptoms of fungal keratitis are blurred vision, a red and painful eye that does not improve when contact lenses are removed, increased sensitivity to light, and excessive tearing or discharge (11). Fungal keratitis is recognizable by the presence of a coarse granular infiltration of the corneal epithelium and the anterior stroma. The corneal defect usually becomes apparent within 24 to 36 h after the trauma. There is minimal to absent host cellular infiltration. The absence of inflammatory cells is likely a good prognostic finding, since products of polymorphonuclear leukocytes contribute to the destruction of the cornea. It has been contended that eyelid lesions are common in patients with eye infections. The eye will appear white with filamentous projections from the cornea after about a week. Fusarium Keratitis may completely destroy an eye within a few weeks and malignant glaucoma can ensue. If not treated after 5or 6 weeks, blindness may result. A systemic infection is unlikely. If the fungus does get past the eye's defense system and into other tissues, it will be exposed to all of the immune defenses of the body. This includes inflammatory macrophages, granulocytes, and humoral immunity. However, this can lead to inflammation of the tissue surrounding the eye. The eye will appear severely red and tearing will ensue to lower the pH of the eye and introduce lysozyme to the fungus. Fungal and human cells have similar mechanisms for DNA, RNA and protein synthesis. This greatly limits the number of potential antifungal drug targets because the vast majority of compounds that inhibit fungi also are toxic to human cells. Therefore, antifungal drugs tend to target the few features of fungal cells that differ from human cells. Most fungal cell membranes contain ergosterol, rather than cholesterol, which is the sterol found in human cell membranes. Amphotericin B directly binds to ergosterol, whereas the azoles (e.g., itraconazole, fluconazole, voriconazole, miconazole, ketoconazole) and terbinafine target ergosterol synthesis (4). However, the major distinguishing feature of fungal cells is a rigid cell wall containing chitin, mannans and glucans (the target of the echinocandin class of antifungal drugs). Fluconazole is an oral anti-fungal medication known to be effective in curing numerous types of fungal infections throughout the body. It functions to block the pathway for sterol synthesis in Fungi (3). Clinical trials have shown that it is able to fight fungal eye infections like Fusarium keratitis. The active ingredient is 2,4-difluoro-�,�1-bis(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-ylmethyl) benzyl alcohol. Fluconazole is sold under the name Diflucan, made by Pfizer. One dose is 100mg, and 30 pills costs $434.98. Two pills are taken daily for two weeks, or until symptoms cease to exist. Natamycin is highly effective at fighting fungal Keratitus. Natamycin is a tetraene polyene antibiotic derived from Streptomyces natalensis. The mechanism of action appears to be through binding of the molecule to the sterol moiety of the fungal cell membrane. The polyenesterol complex alters the permeability of the membrane to produce depletion of essential cellular constituents. The active ingredient is a stereoisomer of 22-[(3-amino-3, 6-dideoxy-(beta)-D- mannopyranosyl)oxy]-1,3,26-trihydroxy-12-methyl-10-oxo-6,11,28-trioxatricyclo[22.3.1.0 5,7 ] octacosa-8,14,16,18,20-pentaene-25-carboxylic acid (3). The manufacturer is Alcon, and sold under the name Natacyn. A 15mL bottle costs $220. Natacyn is administered is through the use of eyedrops. The user usually takes one eyedrop every 4 to 6 hours, though more serious infections may require a higher dose. Due to the economic restraints held by some of the sufferers of the Fusarium Keratitis infection, our outlook would be that an alternative more affordable means of therapy should also be looked at as a potential cure. We recommend the product Melaleuca Alternifolia or more commonly known as tea tree oil. It has already been proven through laboratory research to be an effective substitute from conventional medicine in treating fungal infections of the mouth and foot (8). The active ingredients involved in tea tree oil are Terpinen-4-ol and Cineole (8). It is mainly produced in Australia and marketed in the United States by the company Desert Essence. They sell their product for the price of $19.99 for every 2 fluid ounces (7). We propose that the initiative be taken to enhance the product into a form suitable for application to the eye (i.e. eye drops). As of now only a topical solution is available which is both used in the diluted form for gargling in the mouth, and as a direct applicant to the skin. Eye drop usage once every 4-6 hours as has been shown to be effective with Natacyn may be sufficient, but if results did not show then an increase in the frequency of application could be imposed. The ReNu MoisturLoc product may have been sterile when it left the plant in Greenville. However, the ingredients in MoisturLoc are different from the other formulas made by Bausch. It is important to note that only ReNU MoisturLoc is related to the greater chance of developing the Fusarium Keratitus infection. One reason this could be possible is because the MoisturLoc provides an environment where the Fusarium can thrive and reproduce in. The MoisturLoc may be a sort of minimal essential media for the fungus. It is already known that the Fusarium did not come from the factory. However, when the user puts the MoisturLoc in the contact cases, Fusarium is able to grow on the lens. The method by which Fusarium gets access to the solution is unknown, but since spores can be airborne it is possible for the fungus to randomly land in the solution. In this case, the probability of contaminating the solution depends on the user; if the user keeps the solution near outdoor areas or other places with spores, then the likelihood of contamination increases. After the user puts the infected contacts in their eyes, the fungus on the lens will come into contact with the eye. The fungus is then trapped between the eye and contact lens for the entire day which gives the Fusarium enough time to get through the cornea and reproduce in the eye, causing infection. Another possible reason that the ReNu MoistureLoc may be causing infection is because a chemical in MoistureLoc may be causing the defense system of the eye to malfunction. An ingredient in the solution may be acting as an inhibitor of a defense mechanism. Normally the eye may come into contact with Fusarium on a daily or weekly basis. The lymphoid tissue of the conjunctiva is usually able to fight off the infection under normal conditions. However, when a patient who uses contacts with MoisturLoc comes into contact with the eye, perhaps the conjunctiva lymphoid tissue is no longer able to fight off the disease. This may be because the MoisturLoc is inhibiting cytokines (e.g., IL-1, IL-6, IL-12, or TNF-a) that normally promote defensive cells to attack the fungus. In this way, a Fusarium Keratitis infection would proceed easier.

BIO.G0.12.2,Lab Report 2: Plant Biodiversity ,Biology,Report,"Biodiversity can be simply defined as the totality of genes, species, and ecosystems in a region. (Wikipedia, Biodiversity) This definition encompasses all organisms, from complex eukaryotic plants to simple unicellular bacteria, found in a particular geographical area or habitat. When discussing the biodiversity of an area, ecologists often attempt to quantify the amount of biodiversity present in one particular area using one of several indices. From these indices, it has been shown that biodiversity is not evenly distributed throughout the world. For instance, biodiversity is much higher in tropical regions, where there is the highest number of endemic, or native, species. In contrast to the tropics, polar regions, such as Antarctica, have much fewer species present, and therefore contain a lower amount of biodiversity. Since biodiversity is not constant throughout the Earth, one may wonder what factors influence the amount of biodiversity in a region. However, this question has been the topic of debate among many scientists. Scientists have begun to argue against the prevailing theory that geographical isolation via climate change is the one factor that impacts biodiversity the most. Instead, researchers have recently found that the variable evolutionary rate of species is one of top determining factors of biodiversity. (Butler 2005) Because of the increasing loss of biodiversity in biomes around the world, ecologists have also outlined the factors that have led to this decrease in biodiversity. One of the main influences is the presence of human activity, such as deforestation, overpopulation, and pollution. The increase in biodiversity within a region usually requires the formation of mechanisms to adapt to a specialized habitat, such as tropical rainforests. Because of this, many plant families are found in one specific biome. However, there are a few instances in which a plant family has species that inhabit more than one biome. One such example is the Moraceae family, a diverse group comprising approximately 40 genera and 1,000 species. Species from this family are characterized by a milky sap and may be either monoecious, having both male and female flowers on the same plant, or dioecious, having male and female flowers on the separate plants of the same species. The Moraceae flowers are generally small and densely aggregated on the plant. (Burns, Honkala, Glossary) (Carr, Moraceae) The species in this family are known for their economic importance as fruit producers; significant products include figs, mulberries, breadfruit, and jackfruit. (Watson, Dallwitz, Moraceae Link) While the majority of species in this family are found in tropical biomes, a few species are indigenous to temperate biomes. Tropical biomes are characterized by a non-arid climate whose average temperatures remain above 18�C year-round. Tropical biomes include rain forests, monsoon climates, and wet or dry savanna habitats. The tropics are also sometimes referred to as aseasonal, meaning that they do not have great differences in average monthly temperatures or amount of daylight hours throughout the year. Areas that are known for having a tropical climate include Central and South America, Hawaii, and many south Asian countries, such as the Philippines, Malaysia, and Indonesia. (Wikipedia, K�ppen climate classification) Temperate biomes, on the other hand, include a broader range of climates. These mesothermal biomes are characterized by average temperatures above 10�C during warm months and average temperatures between 0�C and 18�C during cold months. There is no typical average yearly rainfall for temperate biomes; amount of precipitation can be anywhere from dry winters to dry summers to significant precipitation during all seasons. Compared to tropical biomes, temperate biomes are distinct in that they have definite seasons; for instance, there are generally large differences in average monthly temperatures throughout the year. Because this category is so expansive, habitats such as Mediterranean, Humid Subtropical, Maritime Temperate, and Maritime Subarctic are all included under the definition of temperate biome. (Wikipedia, K�ppen climate classification) A tropical representative species of the Moraceae family is Dorstenia gigas. This particular species has large succulent leaves and a fleshy receptacle containing flowers attached to a thick stem. (Carr, Moraceae) It is endemic to the Socotra Islands, near the coast of Yemen in the Indian Ocean, and requires a minimal average temperature of about 55�C for growth. This species is not self-fertile, and thus requires two plants, a male and female, to produce seeds. One distinguishing feature of this species is its pollination mechanism. Once seeds become ripe, pressure builds and the seed pod explode, expelling the seeds. Seeds ripen year round. (Faucon, Dorstenia gigas) Since its habitat is generally a dry savanna habitat, the succulent, fleshy leaves serve the purpose of water storage for the plant. However, the leaves of Dorstenia gigas are not as succulent as those of desert biome cacti, to whom water retention and hydration is much more important. In contrast, Ficus carica , commonly known as the fig tree, is an example of a Moraceae species that is found in temperate biomes. Characteristics for this particular species include growth into shrub or low-spreading deciduous tree forms and large non-succulent lobed deciduous leaves attached to medium stems and trunks, in contrast to the thick pachycaulous trunks of Dorstenia gigas . This species can grow in temperatures down to -12�C, and can thus tolerate the frost of some temperate climates. (Faucon, Fig (Ficus carica)) The fig tree also has a noteworthy mechanism of reproduction and pollination. Unlike Dorstenia, Ficus is self-fertilizing and depends on the use wasps to transfer pollen from a kind of Ficus flower called a caprifig (one which does not lead to a fig fruit) to a non-pollen-producing flower that leads to an edible fig. (Faucon, Fig (Ficus carica)) Given that temperate biomes have distinct seasons, Ficus carica trees produce fruit and flowers during the warm summer months. Also as a result of its temperate habitat, Ficus carica is dormant during the cold winter months, and often resprouts from its roots, so that it may produce fruit in the summer. (Christman, Ficus carica) As can be seen, a range of biodiversity can be found around the world and is dependent of several factors. Since plants are often specially adapted for their specific biomes, it is not common to find a plant family that includes member species in more then one biome. However, the Moraceae family is an example of this; the genus Ficus includes a species that inhabits the temperate zone, while the genus Dorstenia is found only in tropical climates. Given that these species of the Moraceae family have thrived in their respective biomes for a significant amount of time, one can surmise that the species will be maintained in the future, as long as their environments do not drastically change. Finally, it is also likely that plant species of other families will follow the example of Moraceae. In the future, genera and species of a single family may become more diverse and occupy several biomes as they adopt specific structures that allow them to adapt to varied climates.

BIO.G0.13.1,Malaria Disease and Transmission,Biology,Report,"Malaria is the disease caused by parasitic protozoa of the genus Plasmodium (1). Symptoms of malaria usually resemble the flu; however, in young children, pregnant women, and immunocompromised patients the disease may lead to eventual death (2). It is the most serious, widespread parasitic disease causing over one million deaths annually. The disease is restricted to tropical and subtropical regions where the insect vectors, Anopheles mosquitoes, are present; this encompasses a thick band of countries surrounding the equator. There are four species of Plasmodium that infect humans, including P. falciparum, vivax, ovale, and malariae. The life cycle includes two hosts, female Anopheles mosquitoes and humans (1). A human host is inoculated with Plasmodium sporozoites when an infected mosquito takes a human blood meal. The sporozoites of Plasmodium travel in the blood stream to the liver where they infect hepatocytes and mature into schizonts. These schizonts rupture after about six days and release 30,000-40,000 daughter cells called merozoites into the blood stream. Erythrocytes are then invaded by single merozoites. In 48 hours the organism undergoes asexual reproduction and produces 8-24 daughter cells. The red blood cells rupture and the new daughter cells invade more red blood cells. The clinical manifestations of Malaria are caused by the blood stage parasites that destroy large numbers of erythrocytes every two days. The remaining life cycle stages known as the sporogonic cycle occur after Plasmodium gametocytes are ingested by an Anopheles mosquito. During a 10 - 18 day period ingested macrogametes are penetrated by microgametes to produce zygotes in the stomach of the mosquito. These zygotes penetrate the midgut wall of the mosquito where they develop into oocysts, which rupture to release sporozoites. The sporozoites then travel to the mosquito salivary glands where they can infect a new host. The Anopheles mosquitoes remain asymptomatic when infected with the parasites; they only serve as vectors. The successful completion of the sporogonic cycle is dependent upon if the inoculated mosquito survives long enough for the Plasmodium to finish the cycle and if weather conditions are appropriate (hot and humid) for Plasmodium development. In the early 1950's Malaria was successfully eradicated from the U.S. through the use of DDT, chloroquine, and other anti-malarial medications and insecticides (1, 4). Efforts were made worldwide beginning in 1955 to continue to reduce the malarial burden. In western Europe malaria was declared eradicated in 1975. Due to difficulties with surveillance in developing countries the malaria eradication project was abandoned in 1978. Malaria is still ever present worldwide with 41% of the global population living in areas where malaria is endemic (1, 2, 4). There are approximately 350 million cases annually, with sub-Saharan Africa being the most heavily impacted. Across all developing countries, malaria is the cause of death for 1 out of every 10 children. Malaria causes a total of over one million deaths annually; 3,000 daily deaths are children's. Today it is much more challenging to treat and control malaria than it was in the early 20th century. In recent years the evolution of new drug and insecticide resistant strains of Plasmodium and Anopheles respectively have evolved. Additionally, it has been hypothesized that climate changes due to global warming are beginning to increase disease incidence. Population movements cause non-endemic countries to be at constant risk for introduction of malaria. Protection from malaria can be attained at the human host level or the Anopheles vector level. People living in malaria endemic areas of the world often develop an acquired immunity from continual exposure to the malarial parasite (1). This immunity does not protect them from contracting the Plasmodium but does from the severe clinical manifestations of the disease. Some individuals, typically those from endemic regions, do have an innate immunity against Plasmodium from genetic blood disorders, such as caring one recessive sickle cell gene for abnormal hemoglobin or lacking Duffy receptors on red blood cells so Plasmodium are unable to infect erythrocytes. For individuals without innate or acquired immunity against malaria prophylactic drug therapies are available. These medications do not prevent one from contracting the disease; however, they suppress Plasmodium from maturing inside the host and thus minimize symptoms. The distribution of these medications is often difficult in developing nations. Control at the vector level attempts to prevent initial malaria infections. The most common and currently most effective method involves the use of insecticide treated bed nets (2). However, distribution and retreatment of these nets has proven challenging and costly (1). Insecticide spraying inside of homes is also effective, although over 125 species of Anopheles have developed resistance against at least one insecticide. Other effective measures include the destruction of larval breeding sites, the development of genetically altered mosquitoes that actually kill the malaria parasites, and the development of vaccines, but all these solutions require costly resources. Complete control of malaria is not an unrealistic goal for the future because malaria is a treatable and preventable disease. Implementation of successful, sustainable anti-malaria programs including monitoring and intervention will require a concerted effort by local government authorities in conjunction with international government, NGO, private and public sector resources. From a humanitarian standpoint the United States government should invest resources in controlling the global spread of malaria; however, even with only America's self serving interests in mind international anti-malarial programs should be supported. Even since the successful U.S. eradication in 1951 U.S. citizens remain an at risk population (1). In the U.S. there have been 63 outbreaks of malaria between 1957 and 2003 where locally infected Anopheles mosquitoes acted as vectors. These resident mosquitoes (both A. quadrimaculatus and A. freeborni are common in the United States and capable of acting as vectors for malaria) continue to put Americans at risk for the reintroduction and spread of malaria. In 2002 alone there were 1,337 reported cases of malaria in the States. The vast majority of these cases were acquired outside of the U.S.; although, a small portion of them may have been caused by blood transfusions with Plasmodium infected blood, organ transplants, or congenital transmission. With global warming altering weather patterns, the percentage of American regions with appropriate climates for the survival and reproduction of Plasmodium will rise, thus increasing the risk for local malaria outbreaks. Moreover, heightened travel and immigration from malaria endemic regions increases the possibility of malaria reintroduction (or even more frightening, the introduction of drug-resistant strains) into the United States. Recently much progress has been made towards eliminating the burden of Malaria in the less developed nation of Mexico. After the government implementation of an effective monitoring and intervention program there has been a 97% decrease in malarial cases since 1985. Currently few regions of the country, mostly the southern border territories that are difficult to access, are still at risk for malaria outbreaks. This significant progress towards eradication should encourage a continued commitment to fighting malaria globally. In 1998, the international Roll Back Malaria Partnership was launched with the ambitious goal of halving the global burden of malaria by 2010 (4). There are 86 participating entities from both malarial endemic and non-endemic nations. The partnership states that, ⬦ a successful fight against malaria will have far-reaching impact on child mortality, maternal health, and poverty, which in turn may increase global stability. For all of the preceding reasons, amongst numerous others, the United States should concern itself with the treatment and prevention of Malaria worldwide. There are U.S. government supported international anti-malaria programs already in place. In June of 2005 Mr. Bush announced the President's Malaria Initiative (1, 3). The goal of the program is to halve malarial deaths in target sub-Saharan African nations within three years of implementation. US$1.2 billion has been pledged for these efforts over the next five years. Eventually 15 of the most affected African nations will be included in the program with the most at risk populations of young children and pregnant women being targeted. It involves supporting local governments so they can provide insecticide-treated nets, indoor insecticide spraying, combination drug therapies, and education to increase the numbers of individuals who seek care. Additionally, the President's Malaria Initiative is working to improve local infrastructure surrounding intervention, encouraging private sector involvement, and closely monitoring its own program to ensure its success and wise use of resources. Only implementing this program in 15 countries is hardly enough. The President's Malaria Initiative is expected to effect approximately 175 million people, yet there are well over 300 million cases of malaria annually. The total debt to Africa alone from direct (money spent on medical visits, insecticide treated nets, medications, funerals, ect.) and indirect causes (income and productivity lost) is estimated to be US$12 billion dollars annually - the U.S. government is investing only one-tenth of this annual loss over a period of five years (4). More can be done to protect residents of endemic countries. The cost of potentially life saving anti-malarial drug therapies are incredibly inexpensive, ranging from US$0.13 for chloroquine or US$0.14 for sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine to US$2.68 for a course of quinine (1). The Roll Back Malaria Partnership estimates that in addition to the current donations and support they receive (of which the President's Malaria Initiative and the U.S. Agency for International Development among other U.S. supported agencies are included) another US$3 billion dollars must be raised annually in order to successfully achieve their goal. US$2 billion is needed in Africa with the remaining US$1 billion required for malaria endemic nations of other continents. It is not the United States' responsibility to supply in full these additional resources. It is feasible for the U.S. government to continue building and strengthening partnerships with both the public and private sector, non-profit and grass-roots organizations (5). There are social issues inhibiting the success of anti-malaria programs including poverty, civil unrest, war, food shortages, and other complex emergencies that face malaria endemic countries (4). These social problems drastically inhibit adequate treatment and surveillance systems that must be in place to truly combat malaria (1). Education about malaria and its global impact should be presented to those living in developed nations who may be willing to help. One person can save a life in Africa with a US$10 donation. Impoverished families living in malaria endemic regions may spend up to 25% of their annual income on prevention and treatment of the disease (4). The reduction of the malarial burden will promote a more stable and productive global market (5). This will set the stage for increased economic development in current malaria endemic nations and for an increased quality of life for their citizens. Currently the U.S. supports numerous programs committed to fighting public health crises across the globe. Combating infections such as HIV/AIDS and the possible pandemic flu outbreak will have similar positive results to fighting malaria. It is difficult to balance available U.S. resources among all of these quality disease control and prevention programs. The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief has allotted US$15 billion, for a five year period which began in 2003, to combat the disease in over 120 countries (5). This is a far more extensive endeavor than the President's Malaria Initiative. AIDS affects more individuals worldwide than Malaria, an estimated 40 million are living with HIV. Today over one million American's harbor the AIDS virus, and it is estimated that 40,000 new infections occur annually within the United States. The rate of incidence rises drastically in less developed nations. For these reasons HIV/AIDS programs should be of higher priority and receive more U.S. government funding than anti-malarial programs. The President's National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza Preparedness and Response was outlined in late 2005 to help plan a course of action for when the United States, and the world, is faced with a pandemic flu outbreak. Such an outbreak is foreseeable in the near future (from the H5N1 avian flu virus) and may have devastating impacts worldwide if proper precautionary measures are not taken. The last three flu pandemics occurred in 1918, 1957, and 1968; they killed 40 million, 2 million and 1 million people respectively. The program's budget of US$7.1 billion is to be used for detection of international outbreaks, national accumulation of vaccines and antiviral medications, and to increase national and local governments' readiness to respond to such an outbreak. Again, the funding for this flu pandemic program is greater than that of the anti-malarial program. The potential devastating effects of a pandemic flu outbreak in the United States are vast, but will they be worse than if malaria is reintroduced? It is not unrealistic that malaria could one day become endemic in the United States. The main risk for reintroduction of the disease is by frequent travelers to, and immigrants from, South and Central American countries (1). Additional resources should be sent to support the prevention and control of disease in these countries. It is possible for money to be reallocated from the pandemic flu program to support anti-malarial programs outside of sub-Saharan Africa. Both flu and malaria programs in relation to the United States are functionally preventative; however, the anti-malaria program would serve to be more beneficial to current people living in malaria endemic regions. A few hundred million dollars should be reallocated from the President's National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza Preparedness and Response budget to support anti-malaria programs outside of sub-Saharan Africa, focused in the Americas.

BIO.G0.16.1,Role of Leptin in Cardiovascular Disease,Biology,Report,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) has an enormous impact on global health, particularly in developed nations like the United States. CVDs currently afflict more than 70 million Americans.1 In addition, nearly 910,000 Americans die of such diseases every year.1 These diseases cumulatively result in over 6 million hospitalizations yearly and over $403 billion in health care expenditures and lost productivity.1 Thus, the need to develop new treatments to quash CVDs is great. One way to prevent cardiovascular disease is to reduce risk factors leading to onset of the disease. The development of cholesterol-lowering statins and anti-hypertensive angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors have been important steps toward eradicating CVDs. Though numerous pharmacologic agents exist to reduce risk factors, the identification of novel risk factors and their stimulatory conditions could lead to more effective treatments. Current examinations of critical factors in CVD development often converge on leptin. Worldwide research has recently elucidated the significance of this small molecule in CVD progression through widespread and dynamic mechanisms. A review of current findings on leptin's role in CVD will be at the center of this report. Leptin is a 16-kDa peptide hormone product of the obese (Ob) gene secreted primarily by white adipocytes (Figure 1).2 This pleiotropic hormone has been shown to impact regulation of food intake, energy expenditure, and reproduction in mammals.3 Leptin functions as a hormonal mechanism for sensing fat deposition, whereby greater adipocyte density and size yields more leptin which subsequently curbs apetite and increases energy expenditure.3 Leptin synthesis is under further regulatory control of factors such as glucocorticoids, insulin, and melanin-concentrating hormone.4,5 Research into leptin's role in obesity and energy metabolism ultimately led to the discovery of its importance in cardiovascular disease. As a peptide hormone, leptin exerts its physiologic effects through a cell-surface receptor. At least six isoforms of the Ob receptor exist, with only one (Ob-Rb) capable of undergoing a fully functional response to stimulation.6 The Ob receptor is a transmembrane protein sharing structural similarity to gp130 receptors utilized by various cytokines.7 Chemical cross linking studies demonstrated that Ob-Rb homodimerizes following leptin stimulation.8 Once triggered, this complex is capable of activating several intracellular signaling pathways via cytoplasmic box motifs present in the receptor's amino acid structure. Leptin utilizes JAK2 kinase activity to modulate its effects in different pathways including JAK/STAT, MAPK, and PI3K (Figure 2).7,8 These intracellular signal cascades often induce transcription that leads to regulation of the anorexigenic and other effects of leptin.7 Actions mediated by the leptin receptor occur throughout organisms spanning from the CNS to peripheral tissues with Ob-Rb identified in lung, kidney, testis, and skeletal muscle tissue.9 With such widespread receptor distribution, new functions of leptin are being discovered frequently. Clinical research has demonstrated an association between elevated plasma leptin levels and cardiovascular complications in humans. One such study examined moderately hypercholesterolemic men with no history of myocardial infarction and/or coronary artery disease in an effort to identify new risk factors for CVD.10 This study discovered a statistically significant relationship between the likelihood of a coronary event (defined as myocardial infarction and need for coronary revascularization) and circulating leptin levels. When controlling for prominent risk factors such as age, lipids, and systolic blood pressure, for each 1 SD increase in circulating leptin concentration the relative risk of a cardiovascular event increased by 1.20. This preliminary study suggested a correlation between high leptin levels and cardiovascular disease that warranted further studies into the potential role of leptin in cardiovascular disease. Experiments conducted at the University of Michigan directly implicated leptin in atherosclerosis and thrombosis.11 In these studies, APOE -/- mice (prone to developing atherosclerotic plaques) were subjected to chronic elevated leptin levels through daily injections of recombinant murine leptin. Following a 4 week injection period, mice were examined to determine total atherosclerotic lesion as well as the time to vessel occlusion as a measure of atherosclerosis and thrombosis. Atherogenesis measurements revealed significantly greater atherosclerotic lesion and aortic intima thickness in mice that received leptin relative to vehicle, corresponding to increased severity of disease. Mice that received leptin treatment also achieved occlusive thrombus due to photochemical injury significantly faster than vehicle. Minimal changes in total cholesterol and triglycerides revealed a potentially direct effect of leptin on disease progression. These experiments clearly implicate leptin in cardiovascular disease development. A closer examination of the central and peripheral effects of leptin will clarify its observed role in CVD progression. Elevated blood pressure, or hypertension, is diagnosed in humans with a systolic blood pressure of over 140 mm Hg and a diastolic blood pressure of over 90 mm Hg. Though no perceptible symptoms are usually present, secondary complications of hypertension can be severe. Secondary conditions such as myocardial infarction, hypertensive cardiomyopathy, and hypertensive retinopathy often occur. A Japanese investigation into the potential role of leptin in development of hypertension revealed a statistically significant correlation between circulating leptin levels and incidence of hypertension.12 The study examined adolescents and excluded individuals with prior metabolic or cardiovascular disorders. After adjustment for age and BMI, researchers found that elevated leptin levels correlated significantly with increased blood pressure in obese individuals. These results suggested a possible role of leptin in hypertension. The development of transgenic skinny mice that overexpress leptin under the control of a liver-specific promoter provided a new experimental model to examine leptin's role in hypertension without the confounding variable of obesity.13 The power of this model stems from its ability to achieve chronically high leptin levels without high amounts of adipose tissue. Plasma leptin concentrations in the transgenic mice used in the experiment were 60.6 � 14.4 ng/mL, approximately 10-fold higher than those in nontransgenic littermates (4.8 � 0.6ng/mL). Tail-cuff systolic BP measurements revealed significantly elevated BP in transgenic skinny mice compared with nontransgenic littermates (120.0 � 1.6 vs.102.7 � 2.7 mmHg; n = 12; P < 0.001). Further analysis revealed roughly 3 fold higher epinephrine and norepinephrine levels in urine of transgenic vs. nontransgenic mice with comparable total urine output. This data suggested a leptin-mediated chronic sympathetic activation, which may have led to the observed hypertension in these mice. The investigators tested this theory though a sympathetic blockade of �1-adrenergic, �-adrenergic, or ganglionic blockers. This blockade effectively abrogated the observed hypertension of the skinny mice and had no effect on the blood pressure of nontransgenic mice. This result suggests that the observed leptin-mediated hypertension does rely on sympathetic activation (Figure 3). Additional studies examining the importance of sympathetic activation on leptin-mediated cardiovascular effects through direct IV leptin injections on rats revealed tachycardia as an additional effect of leptin.14 This research group was able to reduce this observed elevated heart rate with an adrenergic blockade that suggested that leptin mediates tachycardia through sympathetic activation as well. Leptin may also contribute to hypertension through its effects on circulating white blood cells. Flow cytometric analysis of blood samples from healthy human subjects with an anti-leptin receptor mAb showed that 25 +/- 5 % of monocytes, 12 +/- 4% of polymorphonuclear cells, and 5 +/- 1% of lymphocytes express the Ob-R.15 This expression pattern would allow leptin to mediate a robust effect on white blood cells. Researchers observed leptin's ability to stimulate cytokine production through experiments on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC).15 Leptin treatments of 50-1000 ng/ml on these cells significantly induced the production of IL-6 and TNF-alpha as observed through flow cytometric measurements. Leptin's ability to stimulate cytokine production may be important to hypertension because several studies have demonstrated that increased levels of these cytokines stimulates hypertension.16 This data demonstrates the dynamic effects of leptin and its ability to affect CVD in multiple ways through indirect effects on different tissues. Atherosclerosis is the process of accumulating fatty substance, cholesterol, cellular waste, calcium and fibrin on the inner lining of arteries. These vessel-narrowing deposits, called plaques, can be compensated for by artery enlargement, but inevitably lead to plaque ruptures and arterial stenosis. Many factors contribute to atherogenesis including smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration, neovascularization, and calcification of vascular cells. Leptin has been shown to play a key role in each of the aforementioned processes involved in atherogenesis. Arterial intima thickening observed in atherosclerosis has been attributed in part to proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) that migrate into the intima of the artery. Leptin has been shown to increase both VSMC proliferation and migration. A study to determine leptin's effects on these processes treated VSMC isolated from rat aorta with several doses of leptin in different assays.17 Researchers observed an approximately 20% increase of maximal cell number in VSMC cultures treated with leptin (100ng/ml) vs. vehicle over a three day time course. A chemotaxis assay that examined the propensity of VSMC to migrate towards a chemoattractant solution of leptin through a microchemotaxis chamber revealed that 3 fold more cells were able to migrate through a polycarbonate membrane following a leptin trail than with no leptin trail. The use of specific inhibitors of PI3K pathway (wortmannin and LY 294002) showed that this pathway was critical for the migratory effect of leptin. Several other reports suggested that leptin mediates proliferation through the MAPK pathway, though it was not explicitly examined in this publication. These results clearly describe leptin's ability to stimulate VSMC proliferation and migration. Studies have shown neovascularization within atherosclerotic plaque to be critical to plaque formation.21 Neovascularization may act as a gateway for leukocyte entry into sites of chronic inflammation in atherosclerotic plaques. Angiogenisis inhibitors were found to inhibit both atherosclerosis and macrophage infiltration into plaques.21 Other complications of angiogenesis occur primarily because arterial walls are normally free of microvessels except in the atherosclerotic plaques where there are dense networks of capillaries known as the vasa vasorum. These fragile vessels can cause hemorrhages that can significantly impair cardiac function. Leptin's ability to stimulate neovascularization was demonstrated both in vivo and in vitro by a group of researchers.18 Leptin-infused matrigel was used to plate human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECS), which were then cultured in serum free media and examined qualitatively four hours after plating. The HUVECs cultured on matrigel containing 100 ng/ml of leptin formed capillary like structures that were not present in control groups plated without leptin. This induced structure corresponds to leptin's ability to promote neovascularization within atherosclerotic plaques. In vivo studies of leptin's effects were achieved through implantation of a pellet composed of hydratable hydrogel and PBS or 125 ng of leptin into a corneal pocket of rat eyes. Examination of these eyes seven days following implantation showed that the leptin pellet promoted substantial new vessel growth within the eye (Figure 4). Exploration into the mechanism of leptin-mediated vascularization revealed an upregulation in VEGF in leptin treated HUVECS. Experiments also revealed increased production of the matrix metalloproteinases MMP-2, MMP-9, and TIMP-1 in response to leptin. VEGF and the MMPs have previously been described as important factors in initiating angiogenesis through tissue remodeling and endothelial cell proliferation. Histological examination of atherosclerotic plaque revealed the presence of OB-Rb, VEGFR-1, and MMP activity. Thus, leptin's ability to upregulate VEGF and MMP is likely responsible for its effects on angiogenesis within atherosclerotic plaques. Vascular calcification is an actively regulated process involving calcifying vascular cells (CVC) that reside in the arterial walls and undergo osteoblastic differentiation and form hydroxyapatite mineral. This calcification corresponds to severity of atherosclerosis and may play a role in plaque instability. One group of researchers showed leptin's ability to facilitate this calcification in CVC cells.19 Alkaline phosphatase is a marker of osteoblastic differentiation in CVC that mediates the differentiation process and provides phosphate ions for calcium phosphate mineral formation. Treatment of CVC with leptin for 4 days caused a dose dependent 5-10 fold induction of alkaline phosphatase activity as measured by a cell-associated alkaline phosphatase activity assay. This suggests an ability of leptin to prepare these cells for osteoblastic differentiation. In another study, a 45Ca incorporation assay showed leptin's stimulatory effect on calcium uptake into CVC. Taken together, these data suggest a predominant role of leptin in vascular calcification. Thrombosis is the formation of a clot within a blood vessel that obstructs the flow of blood through the circulatory system. Thrombi normally form following injury to the vessel's wall and stagnation of blood flow past the point of injury. Abnormalities in coagulation are also responsible for thrombus formation. Thrombosis is a particularly dangerous CVD because it can lead to ischemia that can severely damage tissue. Thrombi also can detach and enter systemic circulation as an embolus that can obstruct critical vessels near the heart or brain. Leptin's pro-thrombotic effects described previously in this review are likely due to its role in promoting aggregation of platelets. The presence of the Ob-Rb on platelets suggested that it may play a direct role in aggregation. To test this theory investigators studied the effects of leptin on platelet aggregation in vitro.20 Investigators used Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) isolated from murine blood. These isolated platelets were dosed with leptin (100ng/ml) and analyzed for platelet aggregation with a microplate reader at 560-nm wavelength. Higher transmittance corresponded to increased platelet aggregation. Though leptin alone did not have any effect on platelet aggregation, leptin significantly enhanced Adenosine diphosphate- (a known platelet agonist) induced aggregation (transmittance of leptin-treated 34.5% � 0.6% vs. vehicle-treated 17.9% � 0.2% ; P < 0.001). To ensure that this was a specific effect of leptin, the investigators examined platelets with a non-functional leptin receptor (db/db). Results of their experiments revealed no leptin enhanced platelet aggregation with db/db cells, and confirmed that it was in fact a leptin receptor mediated action. Overall, these results demonstrate the specific effect of leptin in enhancing platelet aggregation. Leptin plays a significant role in many processes related to the development of CVD. Though it appears to be an important factor in disease progression, treatment options related to significantly decreasing leptin levels could be problematic. Since leptin plays a critical role in normal physiologic function, antibody treatments against leptin could be more harmful than beneficial. Significant research must still be performed into testing the viability of leptin as a therapeutic target. One potent way to reduce leptin levels and consequently risk for CVD, however, is to reduce adipose tissue. Thus, research on leptin's role in CVD should act as an impetus towards increasing education regarding proper diet and exercise. Figure 1.

BIO.G0.18.1,Mammal Diversification,Biology,Report,"The advent of molecular clocks has created a rift in the understanding of mammalian emergence and diversification. The fossil record, previously the sole authority on the subject, has long suggested a fairly dormant mammalian lineage all through the Cretaceous period, followed by intense, rapid diversification in the wake of the K/T mass extinction. The use of DNA sequence data to create a molecular clock, however, has initiated a different historical perspective, in which mammal diversification had been ongoing long before the Cenozoic. This clash has paved the way for the emergence of three distinct models of mammalian diversification: the short fuse, the long fuse, and the explosive model. While the short fuse model, which purely reflects the molecular approach, and the explosive model, which purely reflects the fossil record, seem to be mutually exclusive, the long fuse model, which employs both techniques, may hold the key to an acceptable middle ground. The transition from reptile to mammal reaches all the way back to the Carboniferous period, over 250 million years ago, with the development of Synapsids. The earliest Synapsids, Pelycosaurs, survived into the Permian period before going extinct. A more mammal-like offshoot of Pelycosaurs, Therapcids, took hold approximately around the time of this extinction. Kemp (2006) argues that the subsequent diversification of Therapcids may have arisen through the disappearance of their relatives, the Pelycosaurs, via the mechanism of incumbent replacement. As Kemp notes, the replacement of Pelycosaurs by Therapcids was a milestone in mammalian evolution because it marked the first metabolic progression from ectotherm toward endotherm: It was the ancestral Therapsid that had crossed the biological threshold on the road that led ultimately to the metabolically more active, versatile and potentially much more adaptable kind of terrestrial organisms represented by the mammals. The Therapcids, however, suffered a severe reduction during the end-Permian extinction. Cynodonts, considered the final link between reptiles and true mammals, were one of the few Therapcid taxa that survived. The presence of these distinct mammalian predecessors, tracing all the way back to the end of the Paleozoic period, provides firm evidence that mammalian development was well underway prior to the K/T extinction. However, it must be noted that while the early divergence of this Synapsid lineage certainly lends insight into mammalian evolution, these ancestors were not mammals themselves. Whether or not true mammals actually originated and diversified long before the K/T boundary is a much stickier matter, and touches on the heart of the controversy currently surrounding mammal diversification. Classical thought had long held that mammalian diversification, by and large, did not occur until directly after the K/T extinction. This theory largely reflected the fossil record, which until recently, was the only available means for assessing phylogenic timeframes. Recently, however, the advent of the molecular clock has provided a new method for piecing together the timeframe for mammalian diversification. These two approaches, however, do not always yield the same view of history. The resulting discrepancy has produced three distinct models of mammalian diversification: the short fuse, the long fuse, and the explosive models. The explosive model largely reflects paleontological evidence, whereas the short fuse model mainly considers molecular data. The long fuse model, in contrast, attempts to reconcile these two extremes. Figure 1: Simplified representations of mammal diversification in each of the three models (Springer, 2003) The short fuse model, which is characterized by extensive interordinal and intraordinal diversification prior to the K/T extinction, challenges the previously held belief that mammal diversification did not take off until the extinction of the dinosaurs, when adaptive radiation allowed the mammalian lineages to fill into the newly-opened niches. The evidence for this new interpretation comes from a modern innovation: the molecular clock. By comparing the DNA sequences of different taxa, and plugging in a given mutation (calibration) rate, it can be estimated how long ago the taxa split. Under this molecular assessment, mammals arose surprisingly early in the Mesozoic period, perhaps even 150 million years ago, as described by Bromham et al (1999). This early origin has surprised many researchers because there is a lack of evidence in the fossil record to support it. However, Bromham notes that this may simply be a result of the biogeography of mammalian origin: it is hypothesized that mammals first evolved in what is currently Africa, a region with a particularly poor fossil record during the late Cretaceous period. The credibility of the short fuse model, which relies almost entirely on DNA sequence data, is often called into question, even by its proponents (Bromham 1999), because of certain assumptions inherent in the molecular clock. Most notably, the molecular clock assumes that mutation rates remain constant, both through time and among different taxa. However, this assumption is contradicted by evidence that rate variability does occur. Studies of hominid and rodent mutation rates demonstrate that mutation rates among different taxa may be profoundly different: Li et al (1996) report that the rate of nucleotide substitution is at least two times higher in rodents than in higher primates. This finding is particularly relevant since both of the taxa examined in this experiment, rodents and hominids, are mammals. The acknowledgement of this rate variation prevents the molecular clock from generating phylogenies with any great degree of precision. The short fuse model, through association, is ultimately tied to this shortcoming in the molecular clock. As a result, the historical view of mammalian diversification presented by the short fuse model often contains broad confidence intervals. Nonetheless, even at the most recent possible predicted divergences, the short fuse model supports several mammalian diversifications well before the K/T boundary. Figure 2: Estimation of mammal diversification according to molecular data. The confidence bars are represented as grey rectangles. (Bromham, 1999) The explosive model, consistent with the classical understanding of mammal diversification, predicts only limited diversification prior to the K/T boundary. As its name implies, the dormant mammal lineage would have then experienced an explosion of diversification directly following the mass extinctions, presumably due to release from predators and competitors. This notion is consistent with the historically widespread pattern of extinction followed by diversification. The model is founded on the fossil record, which, as Futuyma (2005) observes, is thin up until the Cenozoic. Almost all mammalian fossils that can be assigned to modern orders, he explains, occur after the K/T boundary. In the wake of DNA sequence data, some previous advocates of the explosive model have been led to reconsider their stance, while others have simply made adjustments. In one such example, John Alroy (1999), while admitting that molecular analyses give evidence of interordinal mammalian divergences before the K/T boundary, maintains that these rare occurrences do not deconstruct the argument that there was an explosion of diversification directly afterwards. To defend this point, he cites the increase in mammal body size that occurred in conjunction with the diversification directly after the extinctions. This rapid and permanent shift in body size, he holds, can only be explained by the adaptive radiation of mammals into the niches for large body size that had previously been the domain of dinosaurs. The explosive model has come under fire for its sole adherence to and dependence on the fossil record, but Alroy's argument is one which proponents of the molecular clock cannot ignore. In response to the mutual exclusiveness of the short fuse and explosive models, the long fuse model attempts to integrate the two extremes. Under the long fuse model, substantial interordinal splitting occurred in the Cretaceous period, before the K/T boundary, but much of the finer, intraordinal diversification occurred later, in the midst of the K/T boundary and the mass extinctions that it marks. Likewise, the long fuse model attempts to reconcile and utilize data from both the fossil record and DNA sequencing. A prime example of this integrative approach is documented in a recent article by Springer et al (2003). Focusing on plancental mammals, they conducted a molecular analysis on twenty-two gene sequences. Wary of the pitfalls of the molecular clock, their analysis used the Thorne/Kishino method, which improves the molecular analysis in two important ways. First, it takes into account the constraints of the fossil record, and second, it removes the demand for equal mutation rates among each phylogenic branch. The study also incorporated a Bayesian component (Kelly). Upon completing this integrated analysis, Springer's results express the very definition of the long fuse model: Analyses⬦all support interordinal divergences in the Cretaceous followed by intraordinal diversification mostly after the K/T boundary. The hope that the long fuse model will be able to reconcile the molecular clock and the fossil record is quite promising. Preliminary studies, such as the one conducted by Springer et al, have yielded results that are fairly consistent with both seemingly opposed views of history. However, the long fuse model cannot suffice alone. Equally important, dialogue between paleontologists and molecular biologists must be encouraged. Efforts to promote this interaction, such as the conference arranged by Chrisopher Brochu (2004), have already begun, and must continue. Only this dialogue can allow the two schools of thought to take steps in unison toward the common goal, a mutually documented and accepted view on mammal diversification.

BIO.G0.19.1,Malaria Disease and Transmission,Biology,Report,"Malaria is a parasitic protozoa that produces bloodstream infections in its hosts. Four different malarial species infect humans: Plasmodium falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale, and P. malariae. The species vary in virulence, with P. falciparum being the most virulent and causing the most mortality4. Plasmodium infection often causes cycles of fevers and chills as well as anemia. Other symptoms of infection include headaches, nausea and vomiting, fever, enlarged spleen, and liver enlargement. Without treatment, Plasmodium infection can lead to severe disease (cardiovascular shock, pulmonary edema, acute kidney failure, etc) and death4. Malaria is transmitted person to person through an insect vector, the female Anopheles mosquito. Plasmodium exhibits a complex life-cycle that occurs between its human host and its Anopheles vector: The human host's bloodstream is infected with malarial sporozites from the Anopheles salivary glands after being bitten by the mosquito. For 8-14 days the sporozites multiply in the liver; they are then released to the blood and the host's erythrocytes. The organism continues to divide and mature within the blood cells, eventually bursting the cell and releasing many merozoites to infect new red blood cells. However, some merozoites in the blood go into a phase of sexual reproduction (gametocytes) and do not enter the erythrocytes-these gametocytes are taken up by biting mosquitoes. Plasmodium completes its sexual reproduction in the mosquito and sporozites collect in the salivary glands of the mosquito, ready to infect another host. The geographic distribution of Malaria, particularly P. falciparum, centers in warm regions near the equator. Transmission can not occur at high altitudes or in cool temperatures, or in regions without the Anopheles vector. Transmission patterns will vary with temperature ( Plasmodium lifecycle inside the vector depends on it), rainfall (for Anopheles breeding), and species of both Plasmodium and Anopheles . Currently, Sub-Saharan Africa suffers the most from Malaria. Malaria causes the greatest harm to the greatest number of all infectious diseases4. It is estimated that 300-500 million individuals are infected annually, causing over one million deaths2. These deaths most heavily affect children in Sub-Saharan Africa2. Now seen as a tropical disease, Malaria was once endemic in many temperate regions such as the United States. However, in the 1950's a Global Malaria Eradication Campaign was started, and it effectively rid the United States, the former Soviet Union, and Taiwan of Malaria. It also reduced the amount of malarial disease in Latin America, southern Africa, and the Middle East 5. Unfortunately, most of tropical Africa was ign ignored during these eradication efforts, and Ma malaria continued to be a major health threat. There is now a resurgence of Malaria in many countries where it was once controlled, and increasing severity of disease in regions where it remained endemic throughout the century 2. This resurgence is due to a globalized community where there is increased travel and of individuals without immunity to endemic regions. It is also caused by once rural populations' migration to urban regions, where a dense human population is prime for vector transmission of the disease. The most troubling cause of Malaria's resurgence and increase urgency is that many inexpensive and widely used treatments for the disease are no longer effective-Plasmodium has developed resistance. The new drug therapies for Malaria are up to 20 times more expensive than traditional treatments 5, and most endemic countries can not afford them. Infections which were once treatable are becoming more and more the cause of severe disease and death. Complete control and eradication of Malaria is highly unlikely now or in the future. A global eradication would need the help of a vaccine, but the infectious form of plasmodium exhibits antigenic variation, so a stock vaccine would be very difficult to develop 6. However, even in the absence of vaccine, measures can be taken to effectively control Malaria and reduce morbidity and mortality. Drugs may be used on the infectious agent, Plasmodium. Early diagnosis and treatment are critical in preventing morbidity from infection. Chloroquine is the traditional choice, but now many strains of Plasmodium are resistant. Due to resistance, artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) is now available to effectively treat Malaria infections, but ACT is much more expensive than Chloroquine 5. There are many insecticide treatments available to prevent transmission of Malaria. ITN or insecticide-treated bed nets are effective at preventing the vector from transmitting disease, and the insecticide also kills vectors that land on them. IRS/indoor residual spraying of insecticides can also be used with similar results. Larviciding is the application of insecticides to vector breeding sites, but there is difficulty with finding the breeding sites and it requires frequent application 6. Beyond these measures, governments, hospitals, and community infrastructure must be strong enough to educate about and carry out preventative measures and treatments. The U.S. should absolutely be involved in controlling the spread of Malaria. Malaria is unprecedented in its numbers, both that of infections and deaths. It is also unlike any other disease in that it lays a heavy social and economic burden on the communities and countries it ravages. As stated before, Malaria infects 300-500 million people annually and causes 1.1-2.7 million deaths 5. Tropical Africa accounts for 90% of this burden 5. For comparison, the terrorist attacks on 9/11 caused 2,752 deaths10. Using the lowest estimate of malarial deaths/year, Malaria kills 400 times as many people every year-more deaths than having one 9/11 every single day. In addition to deaths, Malaria causes a multitude of complications and disease to those who do not die from infection: seizures, coma, severe anemia, pulmonary edema, thrombocytopenia, cardiovascular collapse, shock, acute kidney failure, and hypoglycemia4. It is this very heavy public health burden of human suffering that provides the first impetus for countries like the US to help. Malaria is a controllable disease that costs relatively little to cure when speaking in westernized terms. Unfortunately, the most malaria-endemic countries are also the world's poorest countries2. Without aid, these countries cannot purchase ACT or provide ITNs to treat and prevent Malaria. Because these malarious countries tend to be so much lower in economic strength, they cannot effectively treat and prevent the disease. Unfortunately, the disease itself is a cause of economic distress. This is the second reason the US should be involved in Malaria control. The GDP of malarious countries grows 1.3% less every year than non-endemic countries2, and their per-capita GDP's were 1/5 those of non-endemic countries 2. Over 35 years this has led to a $100 billion dollar deficit in the GDP of Sub-Saharan African countries 8. Malaria is also very detrimental to business in endemic countries. Malaria causes absenteeism from work, decrease in productivity, and decreased morale of workers. Many investors may steer away from endemic areas, and people in endemic countries themselves are less likely to invest in general when life expectancy is shorter 3. It is difficult for families in endemic areas to succeed economically and be able to have purchasing power. Because the risk of disease is so high, many farmers favor subsistence crops over cash crops because cash crops are more laborious and too risky if someone in the family falls ill 3. The disease has a large impact on the social demographic of endemic countries. With more children dying from malaria, families will tend to have more children, decreasing the amount of resources spent on each child and increasing the amount of time the woman spends at home taking care of children, giving little reason to invest in women's education and decreasing the amount of years a woman can be economically productive in society. Because Malaria causes so much human suffering, and because it has such a harmful effect on the economies of endemic countries, the United States should continue to be involved in Malaria Control. Adequate aid for just a few years can resolve many problems associated with malarial disease and transmission, and create stronger economies in these countries to keep their citizens healthy enough to perpetuate the strong economy. For instance, in some endemic countries, 40% of health spending is on Malaria 7. These countries have very poor health services and infrastructures-if the US aids in Malaria relief, those funds can be diverted towards strengthening the health systems, which will be able to adequately handle future malarial episodes. I propose that the U.S. help fund a Malarial intervention program that involves treatment with prevention methods, centered in Sub-Saharan Africa where Malaria causes the most suffering. The program would include global subsidies for the following: ITNs for all children, preventative treatments for pregnant women (who are especially susceptible to malaria), changing treatments from chloroquine to ACT, and scaling up protocols and hospital stocks from chloroquine to ACT. For Sub-Saharan Africa, this plan costs 824 million dollars annually 5. The U.S., in conjunction with other economic powerhouses and the World Bank, would fund this program for a minimum of 5 years until these countries had a significant decrease in prevalence of Malaria and a strengthened economy/health system infrastructure. At the most recent G8 summit, leaders of the world agreed to forgive nearly 40 billion dollars of debt to the world's poorest countries. Most of these countries are African, and most of these African countries are endemic with Malaria. Had Malaria been controlled in these regions 35 years ago, the GDP of these countries would be approximately $100 billion dollars greater-it is probable this debt would never have existed. Spending money on Malaria control now will undoubtedly save money on foreign aid in the future. Besides reducing the need for foreign aid, controlling Malaria will have positive effects on the countries' economies. After successful malaria control programs, Spain, Italy, and Jamaica all experienced economic growth 3. In a world that is increasingly globalized, their success will translate into economic possibilities for businesses all over the world. For example, Exxon Mobile funded its own anti-malaria program in Africa, and it reported 9.8 million dollars in productivity gains after program implementation 3. With Malaria controlled, tourist industries in Africa can develop and thrive. Better economies will increase household spending or purchasing power, and businesses that produce consumer goods will profit and be able to exist in countries that were formerly too poor or too risky to operate in. Every year, Malaria kills at least 400 times the amount of people that terrorist attacks on 9/11 did. The lives lost on 9/11 were the foundation for public support of the Iraqi war-Americans saw the war as a preventative measure against future terrorist attacks. While it is likely the reasons for war in Iraq are a more complex web of economic and political factors, the U.S. is currently spending 2 billion dollars/week 11. A significant contribution to the malarial control program by the U.S. would cost less than .2% of annual spending on the war. Even if the U.S. were to foot the bill for the entire malarial control program in Sub-Saharan Africa ($824 million annually), malaria control would cost 1/6 of the amount the United States spends annually on funding for cancer-research 9. While cancer research is important and will save many lives in the future, malaria control can save millions of lives right now. It can also help bring impoverished countries out of debt and help them become participants in a strong global economy, and provide trade and investment opportunities for American businesses. It is a win-win situation-saving millions of lives, helping impoverished countries climb out of economic ruts, and increasing U.S. and business opportunities for trade and investment abroad. For the comparatively low cost, Malaria Control is a good cause that the U.S. will benefit from in the future-it is not so much foreign aid as it is an empathetic yet smart investment.

BIO.G0.20.1,A Case for a US International Anti-Malaria Program,Biology,Report,"Malaria is a disease caused by a protozoan parasite. The symptoms of malaria include flu-like symptoms such as high fevers, shaking chills, muscle pain, diarrhea, and in some instances anemia, and hemoglobinuria. In severe cases of malaria, coma or death may occur, in addition to multi organ failure. Symptoms oftentimes follow a cyclic pattern, recurring as the disease progresses. There are several different species that are pathogenic (Plasmodium falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale, P. malariae) but the two most common are Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax. Malaria is spread by the simultaneous infection of humans and female Anopheles mosquitoes. Inside infected humans, malaria replicates within red blood cells. Then, when a female Anopheles mosquito takes a blood meal, the parasite is transferred to the new host where it replicates but does not cause disease. In the female Anopheles mosquito the parasite causes a persistent non-cytopathic infection, whereas in the human it causes an acute cytopathic infection. The parasite can then be transferred to a new human host when the mosquito takes another blood meal. The female Anopheles mosquito acts as a vector in the transmission of the disease. The disease is not transmissible from human to human through simple contact.1 The disease has the highest morbidity and mortality rates among individuals under the age of 5 and among pregnant women. Malaria in pregnant women leads to low birth weight, which in turn leads to numerous other medical problems, some of which are attributable to a lack of expertise in neonatal care in developing countries where malaria is endemic. Each year there are approximately 300-500 million occurrences of malaria worldwide. Additionally, approximately one million individuals die from malaria each year worldwide. The majority of the cases of malaria occur in areas of the world that are underdeveloped and contain a warm moist climate. In the United States there are approximately 1300 cases of malaria annually. It is known that the majority of cases that occur each year in the United States are due to travelers returning from endemic areas such as Sub-Saharan Africa. The death rate in the United States is significantly lower than the rate worldwide due to extensive health care availability compared to underdeveloped countries throughout the world. Malaria has been a known disease for over 4000 years, afflicting peoples across the world. There is a strong history of combating the disease as well. In 1933 Franklin Roosevelt authorized the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), which among other things created a precedent for the funding of an anti-malaria program in the United States. Additionally in 1947 the United States Congress created the National Malaria Eradication Program and was successful in essentially eradicating the disease across the United States in only four years. Worldwide efforts have proven to be successful in some areas, while in others showing negligible success. The lack of total eradication worldwide, according to some experts, can be attributed to, the emergence of drug resistance, widespread resistance to available insecticides, wars and massive population movements, difficulties in obtaining sustained funding from donor countries, and lack of community participation 2. Since 1992 there has been little success in reducing the prevalence of malaria in endemic areas, and some experts agree that if nothing is done to prevent the spread of malaria the death rate could double within the next twenty years3. There are several different options for the control of malaria. The two-fold approach includes methods for prevention of the disease and treatment of the disease. Treatment options include a large number of anti-malarial drugs, however the drug of choice until recently had been Chloroquine. Drug resistance has forced healthcare workers in endemic areas to rely on new anti-malarial drugs. The estimated cost of anti-malarial drug treatment for an individual with malaria is less than $3. (see footnote)4 In addition to anti-malarials there are several methods in practice for the prevention of the disease. One significant method developed is the use of insecticide treated bed nets to protect individuals from mosquito bites while asleep in endemic areas. Additionally efforts at eliminating the mosquito population have proven successful in some areas of the world. The gradual elimination of wetlands in the United States and Europe eliminated many of the mosquitoes' breeding grounds, and it is thought this may work in endemic areas as well. Additionally in developed countries the use of insecticides such as DDT has been shown to eliminate the mosquito populations and eradicate malaria. In many parts of Africa, however, we have seen the development of drug and insecticide resistant strains of the parasite, forcing researchers to look into new ways of combating the disease. While there is not currently a vaccine for malaria, there are several that are being developed. In addition to the growing resistance issues and the lack of a vaccine, a large number of individuals infected with the parasite have no access to healthcare and therefore do not benefit from eradication efforts. The United States in many areas of foreign policy likes to think of itself as the moral leader of the free world. We are actively engaged in pursuits worldwide to liberate peoples under tyrannical rule, eliminate the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and stop the spread of major diseases. Malaria is a major disease worldwide and deserves a significant amount of attention from our Congress. Previous eradication and control programs have ignored the Continent of Africa, where now more than 80% of malaria cases occur5. To stand by idly while millions of young children die from a disease that could have possibly been quelled 40 years ago is disgraceful. In this area the United States should be the leaders of an International effort to, at the very least, control the spread of malaria, if complete eradication is no longer possible.6 Currently, experts in fields of economics, epidemiology, medicine, and biology are in agreement that unless a significant increase in funding is achieved the effort to prevent the further spread of malaria will not be successful. It has been shown that treatment alone, i.e. the use of anti-malarials after contraction of the disease, is not as effective as prevention and treatment combined.7 Additionally research has shown that preventative measures alone will not suffice in controlling the spread of malaria. Indoor residual spraying, one of the most common preventative measures is impossible to rely on singly for several reasons. First, it is a method that requires agents of the national government physically visit each home once or twice a each year and be allowed to spray an insecticide inside a home by the residents. Even if theses officials are successful however, there is still the risk that residents may cover the freshly sprayed walls with new plaster or paint, thereby reducing the effectiveness of the insecticide. Finally this method may only be effective in endemic areas where it can be used as an immediate remedy.8 There is disagreement over the potential costs of a United States led International effort to fight malaria. Some experts suggest that it would cost roughly one penny for every $10 of income of rich countries 9. Others have done extensive research and have put more precise estimates into the playing field suggesting that 95% coverage using a combination approach consisting of anti-malarials, indoor residual spraying, and insecticide treated bed nets for Africa alone at approximately $1 billion10. This cost, while substantial does not cover all associated costs of implementing an International Anti-Malaria program. Additional funds would need to be allocated to account for funding the healthcare workers, for setting up adequate facilities and for maintaining these facilities. After taking all of these factors into consideration it is feasible to control the spread of malaria worldwide for less than $5 billion. This sum seems large until one considers the amount of money spent on the Iraq war, as of November, over $345 billion and rising by the second11. Several studies have been done in an attempt to weigh the cost/benefit ratio of a hypothetical anti-malaria program. While different numerical values have been obtained in each study, it seems that each concludes the same thing. The cost/benefit ratio is favorable. Some conservative estimates place the monetary benefits at 2.4 times as high as the costs, while others go as high as 146 times the cost. The possibility of the higher values makes the proposed anti-malaria programs extremely attractive. Even the lower values for the cost-benefit calculations make it competitive with other government programs12. In determining the cost/benefit ratios researchers looked at several different aspects. One area they looked into was a loss of productivity due to contraction of malaria. One study found that malaria reduced the value of labor productivity by 12%13. An economist reported that persons suffering from malaria miss between 5-20 days of work14. Both of these statistics are staggering. If we were to aid the nations endemic with malaria, we could possibly see an upswing in those nations economies. The benefits of this occurrence could be several fold. First these countries would rely less on foreign aid, as they would be able to fund their own aid programs themselves, both health related and non. Secondly it is possible to think that these new thriving economies could become valuable trade partners with the United States. Finally it is plausible that some of these nations, particularly nations with large Muslim populations, may become strong United States allies, or at the very least no longer be enemies of the United States. In President Bush's State of the Union address in January 2003, he promised the nation and world that the United States would significantly increase the amount of money that went to fight HIV/AIDS worldwide. President Bush pledged $15 billion to help fight the disease.15 His program termed PEPFAR is one that seeks to help those worldwide afflicted with HIV/AIDS. Given that this program distributes funds in a way that discriminates against programs that are not in line with the moral viewpoint of the President, it would seem more beneficial from a political standpoint to give money to programs associated with a disease that has no connection with sexual intercourse in any way. The president could justify reallocating funds simply on moral grounds if he could find no other justification16. It is hard to determine which program should take precedence in funding over the other, however a hypothetical example illustrates why an Anti-Malaria program should be funded at this time17 This example illustrates a very crucial point. First of all both HIV/AIDS and malaria are important diseases in the world and deserve attention on an international scale. However, it has been shown that a minimal amount of money per person can be incredibly effective in controlling, treating and possibly eradicating malaria. At this juncture it would seem more practical to focus our attention and funds on a problem that is more manageable. If we ignore the instances of malaria throughout the world we will undoubtedly be faced with a graver challenge in the future when the disease is able to evolve into something more ferocious and difficult to combat.

BIO.G0.24.1,Varying Infectivity of Diplostomum Flexicaudum in Fish Species of Douglas Lake,Biology,Report,"The metacercarial stage of Diplostomum sp. causes a disease in fish known as diplostomatosis or eye fluke disease (Palmieri et al 1977). This disease shows a negative correlation between parasite abundance and fish condition and has been associated with blindness, cataracts, and in some cases, even death (Marcogliese 1962). In a former study undertaken by Ewing (2004) at the University of Michigan Biological Station, Diplostomum flexicaudum was shown to reduce the survivorship of infected fish, both directly and indirectly. The metacercariae decreased the ability of the fish to recognize a food source and three of the fish exposed to high levels of cercariae died, as compared with no deaths from the control group (Genter 2004, Ewing 2004). The metacercariae in the eyes also affects the fishes' behavior by making them less active and affecting their ability to school, separating them from safety and making them more vulnerable to predators (Fortner 1995). The pathogenic effects of this disease in particular are of great interest because it is so common. Cort (1957) referred to Diplostomum flexicaudum as the most common trematode species in the snails of the Douglas Lake region of northern Michigan. Diplostomum flexicaudum is a digenetic trematode with a three-host life history (Figure 1). Freshwater fish serve as the secondary intermediate host, harboring the metacercarial stage in the lens of the eye. When infected fish are eaten by the definitive host, most commonly gulls, mergansers, or loons, (Marcogliese et al 2001) the adult fluke will develop in the intestine in less than a week (Davis 1936). When the definitive host defecates, the eggs are transferred to the water via the feces. The miracidia hatch in the water approximately three weeks later, and penetrate various species of aquatic gastropods of the family Lymnaeidae including genera Stagnicola and Fossari (Cort et al. 1957). Miracidium give rise to the first intramolluscan stage, the sporocyst, which asexually gives rise to daughter sporocysts in a form of embryonic amplification. Approximately three weeks after the miracidium penetrates the snail it begins shedding hundreds of furcocercous cercariae per day (Becker and Brunson 1966). These fork-tailed cercariae, easily identified by their bent stem, penetrate the skin of various species of fish; traveling to the lens weeks later. Past studies have shown infection levels of Diplostomum sp. in fish to increase with both the age and the length of the fish; it has also been demonstrated to depend on the species of fish and the habitat in which the fish are found (Marcogliese 1962). Differences in the number of metacercariae between the right and the left eye has been investigated and shown to have no difference in mean abundance (Marcogliese 1962). Although various aspects affecting the infectivity of Diplostomum sp. in species of fish has been shown in a variety of locations (Marcogliese 1962, Mamer 1978, Valtonen and Gibson 1997), it has never been sufficiently examined in fish of Douglas Lake, Michigan. In this study, various aspects of the morphology of fish, different species and locations around Douglas Lake were considered as factors that may affect the infectivity of Diplostomum flexicaudum in the fish species evaluated. The locations were picked to vary habitat and evaluate the importance of proximity to the definitive hosts of D. flexicaudum. It was hypothesized that the number of metacercariae in the eye would increase with length and weight of the fish, as well as the weight of the eye. It was further proposed that the fish caught near where the definitive host congregates would have the highest mean abundance of metacercariae. The present experiments were conducted in Cort Laboratory and Lakeside Laboratory at the University of Michigan Biological Station (UMBS) in Pellston, Michigan (Emmet Co.) from the 16th of July until the sixth of August. All species examined were obtained in one of the seven locations chose around Douglas Lake: Hook Point, Fairy (Pells) Island, Sedge Point, bay south of East Point, boat well on UMBS campus, by the dock on UMBS campus and in front of the teachers' cabins of UMBS (Figure 2). Minnows were obtained with wire minnow traps and by seining, while larger fish species were obtained by line and hook method. The total sample size included 32 Notropis stramineus (sand shiners), 23 Perca flavescens (perch), 11 Notropis cornuta (common shiners), ten Ambloplites rupestris (rock bass), three Micropterus salmoides (largemouth bass), one Ictalurus sp. (catfish), one juvenile Catostomus commersoni (white sucker) and two Lepomis gibbosus (pumpkinseed). Figure 2: Locations fish were caught and trapped on Douglas Lake, Pellston, MI Each time a minnow trap was set out the depth of water was measured to the nearest cm; a GPS reading was taken at each of the seven locations. The weather conditions during collection were recorded and the habitat of each location noted. The length of collected specimens was measured (mm) and each was weighed (g) using a scale accurate to three decimal places (Denver Instruments XL-410 Denver, CO). The right and left eyes were then removed, placed in cold-blooded ringers and weighed individually. Each eye was dissected separately in a Petri dish (Pyrex) by teasing apart the eye with dissecting prongs and carefully popping the lens. The number of metacercariae were counted, using a dissecting microscope (Baush & Lomb, Rochester, NY .7x-3x). The number of metacercariae in each eye was recorded by removing each metacercaria individually with a glass pipette to get the most accurate result possible. The larger fish species were sexed before disposal; however this was not possible with the juveniles or minnow species. The smaller fish were numbered and frozen for further reference and data collection. The frozen fish were used to identify the species of minnow and juveniles that were collected over the course of the study and this information was recorded (personal communication with Amy Schrank, Ph.D.). All analyses were run in Microsoft Office Excel, 2003. One-way analysis of variance tests (ANOVA) were run to test species versus total number of metacercariae in the eye, location versus total number of metacercariae in the eye, and weight versus location. Regressions were run to test length or weight versus the total number of metacercariae. A t-test assuming unequal variance was run to compare the number of metacercariae in the right eye to the number of metacercariae in the left eye. A significant correlation between the species and total number of metacercariae in the eye was found (F=13.659, p=0.000298; Figure 3). The perch had a mean abundance of 170.739 metacercariae in both eyes with 100 percent prevalence. The total number of metacercariae in the eyes of perch ranged from 12 to 701. The common shiner had a mean of abundance of 2.626 metacercariae in both eyes with 81.81 percent prevalence. The mean intensity, mean number of metacercariae per infected fish, for the common shiner was 3.22. The mean abundance for the sand shiner was 3.562 metacercariae with 90.63 percent prevalence and a mean intensity of six. The range of metacercariae for the common shiner and sand shiner were both zero to thirteen. Every rock bass that was sampled had zero metacercariae in the eyes. The other species dissected also had zero metacercariae in the eyes but the sample size was deemed to small to be considered real results. The total number of metacercariae did not show a significant correlation with the weight of the fish when all species were considered because non-infected adult species with comparably considerable weights were included (Figure 4). However, when only the infected species of fish (perch, common shiners, and sand shiners) were considered together, the total number of metacercariae in the fish did show a significant positive correlation with the weight of the fish (F=78.498, p=9.935E-13; Figure 5). Weight versus total number of metacercariae for individual species showed the strongest positive correlation for perch (Figure 6) but also showed a positive correlation for common shiners and sand shiners. The total number of metacercariae was shown to increase with length when the infected species of fish were considered together (F=89.63, p=8.709E-14). Each species individually also showed a positive correlation between length and the total number of metacercariae observed. Sand shiners showed the strongest positive correlation while perch and common shiners showed about the same strength positive correlation (Figure 7 & 8). Location versus the number of metacercariae was shown to be significant for perch (F=14.23, p=0.0005; Figure 10), as it was for both species of minnow. However, weight versus location for all species individually was also shown to be significant. The results showing location as significant were more likely because of the weight of the fish caught at a specific location than the actual location or habitat. Figure 9: Bar graph showing average number of metacercariae in perch by location. As expected, the number of metacercariae in the right eye was not shown to be significantly different from the number of metacercariae in the left eye. However, the total number of metacercariae in the eye was shown to correlate significantly with the total weight eye weight of the fish when looked at for all infected species together (F=121.91, p=1.84E-16). It was also significant for perch and common shiners individually, but not for sand shiners. The results confirm that there is a large variation in the number of metacercariae among fish species, ranging from non infection of the rock bass to heavily-infected perch. Many of the other species that were examined appeared to have a zero percent infection rate as well, such as pumpkinseeds and largemouth bass; however their sample sizes were not large enough to make a conclusion. Since such a large variation was shown in the number of metacercariae between the adult species, as well as the minnow species, size cannot be considered the only source of variation. Because it can be assumed that all fish species examined were exposed to the cercariae of Diplostomum flexicaudum, there must be another factor affecting the distribution of the metacercariae among the fish species. Variation among fish species could simply be due to the differences in host physiology and/or anatomy. An unlikely possibility could be that the parasite itself is host specific and will preferentially infect only certain species of fish. It is also possible that the species of fish with zero percent prevalence has evolved a resistance to D. flexicaudum. Three of the fish species considered in this study with a zero percent prevalence of infection are from the same family-Centrarchidae: the rock bass, pumpkinseed and largemouth bass. It may be that this family as a whole has acquired a resistance to the parasite. This should be further evaluated with more fish species and greater sample sizes, while controlling for location. All of the rock bass considered in this study were collected from the same location which may affect the results obtained. It would also be of interest to conduct a study in the laboratory with these species of fish to determine if they can be infected experimentally. This would show whether it is the fish species that prevents the infection or a different factor that affects the distribution of metacercariae among the fish. Although the length, weight, and the eye weight of the fish were shown to be insignificant when all species of the sample were considered, they were shown to be important when just the infected species of fish were evaluated as a group. As the size of different morphological characteristics, such as the length, increased in the fish so did the number of metacercariae in the eye. It is hypothesized that the metacercariae increase as the weight and length of susceptible fish increase because there is more surface area for the cercariae to utilize while penetrating the fish. The increase of parasites with eye weight could be because of the increased space in which the parasites are able to reside, or possibly because of a greater availability of resources provided by a larger host. A study carried out by Cort (1957) showed that the abundance of sporocysts of Diplostomum flexicaudum also increases as the size of the first intermediate host increases. Although these finding could be a consequence of fewer resources available to the parasite in smaller hosts, it is also possible that the metacercariae, like the sporocyst stages, are able to differentiate between the sizes of hosts. Parasites that have been associated with hosts over a long period of time usually show a reduced virulence as a consequence of coevolution with the host (Ridley 2004). The obligatory relationship between the host and parasite make it beneficial to the parasite not to decrease the survivorship of the host to the point of death. Diplostomum flexicaudum may have evolved a mechanism allowing it to reproduce less in smaller hosts, thereby reducing the number of fatalities. Furthermore, the fish species found to have a zero percent infection rate may have evolved host defenses against D. flexicaudum faster than the parasite was able to adapt to the fish, causing the metacercariae to be ineffective in those fish species. This study also found location to be a possible factor in the level of infection in the fish. Unfortunately, because of time constraint and bad weather conditions, the sample size was too small to know if the positive correlation between the number of metacercariae and location was due to the actual location or the weight of the fish caught at the different sites. Many factors could affect whether or not habitat location has an impact on the number of metacercariae infecting any one fish. This study hypothesized that the hosts with the largest parasite abundance would be found in close proximity to area where the definitive host frequents. Because only one fish was caught at Fairy Island, where gulls often congregate, the results are inconclusive. Making the highly unlikely assumption that sample size did not affect the results, the low number of metacercariae in the fish eye could be explained by a lack of snails in the area. Even if the definitive host is present in abundance, all other species of the life cycle must be present as well in order for the parasite to perpetuate. It would be useful to do a snail survey in the areas where fish were caught, including an assessment of how many were shedding cercariae. Assuming location is not significant to the distribution of metacercariae in fish, one might consider the migration capabilities of fish species. If the fish migrates a great deal between locations it would be assumed that the site would not have an effect. Different habitats could also be looked at in further studies to determine if the fish species preference for certain surroundings affect the infection rates of Diplostomum flexicaudum. Although the sample size for this study limited the significant results, many of the findings can be expanded upon in further investigations of the relationships between Diplostomum flexicaudum and its varying infectivity of fish species.

I also thank David Gonthier for his assistance planning the project and time helping collect samples from Douglas Lake and Amy Schrank Ph.D. for help with identification of fish species. Funds and materials for the project were provided by the University of Michigan Biological Station. The metacercarial stage of the digenetic trematode Diplostomum flexicaudum causes a disease commonly known as eye fluke disease in the eye lens' of fish. This study investigates the variation between this parasite and a variety of characteristics such as the weight, length, and species of fish. Weight, length, and eye weight were shown to be positively correlated with number of metacercariae found in infected fish species. More studies with larger sample sizes are needed for a conclusive result with regard to the species of fish and location around Douglas Lake.

BIO.G0.25.1,Malaria in the Twenty-first Century,Biology,Report,"I. Malaria Disease and Transmission Malaria is caused by a parasite with the genus Plasmodium. There are only four known species of Plasmodium that cause malaria: P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale and P. malariae. The vectors that transmit malaria are female mosquitoes of the genus Anopheles. There are over 430 known genus species of Anopheles, but only about 30-50 of them can actually transmit the parasite. Normally malaria is a curable disease, but only if treated properly. After an infectious bite there is an incubation period in the host that varies depending on the species of Plasmodium, before there is an onset of symptoms. The symptoms of malaria that a human host will go through can be categorized as either uncomplicated or severe. With uncomplicated malaria, the symptoms last between 6-10 hours and include a cold stage, a hot stage and then finally a sweating stage. Symptoms occur in a mixture of fever, chills, sweats, headaches, nausea, vomiting, body aches, and general malaise. Severe, or complicated, malaria occurs when a human host is infected by P. falciparum and it is complicated by organ failure or irregularity in the host's blood or metabolism. This kind of infection usually occurs in patients that have little or no immunity to malaria, this most often occurs to those who live in an area with low (or no) malaria infections. Relapses can occur in P. vivaxand P. ovale infections. This is because they have dormant liver stage parasites, called hypnozoites that may reactivate months or years later. There are no symptoms between relapses, and there is also treatment to avoid such occurrences. The life cycle of Malaria consists of two hosts: humans and Anopheles mosquitoes. In humans, the parasite grows rapidly in the liver cells at first and then moves to the red blood cells. During this growth, the red blood cells are destroyed and release daughter merozoites that will go on to invade more red blood cells. It is during this blood stage that the symptoms of malaria are present. When a human infected with the malaria parasite during this blood stage a female Anopheles mosquito takes a blood meal from the human host and it can pick up a certain forms of blood stage parasites. The parasite then proliferates in the mosquito and after 10-18 days the parasite exists as a sporozoite. When the mosquito goes to take a blood meal from another human, the sporozoites are injected with the saliva of the mosquito and thus infecting the human. There are about 300-500 million malaria cases per year throughout the world resulting in 1.5 to 2.7 million deaths. It is one of the leading causes of sickness and death in developing countries. Forty percent of the world's population, about 200 billion people, is at risk in over 90 countries. In the 1960s, only ten percent of the world's population was at risk for malaria. The risk rose to forty percent as mosquitoes developed resistance to pesticides and malaria parasites developed resistance to treatment drugs. Although prevalence of malaria has increased substantially worldwide since the 1960s, in recent years it has begun to stabilize slightly. In the early 1990s, many countries tried a new strategy against malaria that ended up causing higher rates of incidence. Since these countries went back to using pesticides, malaria incidence has decreased dramatically. In conclusion, the problem is worse overall, but it has improved in recent years. Malaria control does not aim to eliminate malaria permanently because right now it is not realistic. A program for malaria control would have to include treatment to individual cases using antimalerial drugs, vector control, bed nets and treatment for pregnant women. Vector control is a successful method of control, and it lead to the eradication of malaria in the United States, USSR and southern Europe between the 1940s and the 1960s. The insecticide most widely used for house spraying has been DDT, although it has been banned from us in some countries. DDT is known as a carcinogen, but there is no solid evidence that it causes significant harm to those exposed. DDT has substitutes such as organophosphate or carbamate insecticides and pyrethroids. Bed nets are another form of vector control while people sleep, but they can be less effective when mosquitoes can bite through. Therefore, bed nets are then treated with pyrethroids to add a chemical barrier. It has been found that bednets treat with pyrethroids are more effective than those that are not. Malaria was once very rampant in the United States, until the 1940s where DDT was used to eradicate it in this country. The mosquitoes that transmit malaria (Anopheles genus) are still very widespread in the US. While there are approximately 1,200 cases of malaria in the United States per year, all but five were contracted from other countries before entry into the US. The five that were contracted here show that malaria can without doubt be once again prevalent in the US. If the United States government allows incidence of malaria to continue to grow in other countries, then it is very possible that the US can once again have malaria circulating here. A U.S. International Anti-Malaria Program can be very costly, yet it must be done in order to protect the United States from the disease itself. Funding for malaria control in developing countries has been decreasing due to fewer donations, which are needed due to the miniscule budget these countries have to work with. Developing countries cannot yet afford the alternatives to DDT, and they are having enough trouble as it is affording DDT as insecticide to spray homes. Between 1993 and 1995, many countries in Africa and South America (not Ecuador) significantly decreased the amount of spraying done in their countries. They implemented a new malaria control strategy which did not call for vector control at all. Afterwards however, the incidence of malaria rose tremendously in these countries. Ecuador, however, increased the amount of spraying of DDT and they were the only country to accomplish a decrease in malaria incidence in 1994. Removing vector control has a high cost of increased incidence rates of malaria; therefore vector control is the most imperative element of malaria control. Insecticide spraying is recommended for the Anti-Malaria Program due to its cost efficiency. DDT will mainly be used, but pyrethroids will be used in cases of DDT resistance because they are the least costly after DDT. A malaria control program in South Africa alone in 2002 was $102,000 US dollars (Tren and Bate, 2004). In order to protect the United States, I would recommend that one million US dollars per year be spent on vector control in South Africa and South America. Since spraying is only involved with the homes, rural areas do not need as much as urban ones. Spraying an entire continent sounds unreasonable, but in perspective is it not. Also one million dollars per year should be spent on treatment of malaria, primarily because it cannot be transmitted if there are not sick people. Another million dollars will be used to treat those coming into the United States from S. America and S. Africa to avoid transmission in our country. This bring the total cost of the plan to three million dollars, far less than what our government is currently spending. There should be a plan to support malaria control for many years, in order to keep it stabilized. Currently the United States is involved with The President's Malaria Initiative, which is the President's plan for malaria relief. This initiative has the same basic points as the plan I have suggested; vector control through spraying homes, insecticide treated bed nets, administer treatments for those ill, and treatment for pregnant women. The main difference between the plans is that the President's initiative is dramatically more costly. According to usaid.org, the President's initiative is spending 1.2 billion dollars over five years, which equates to 240 million dollars per year. The plan I have proposed is much more cost efficient, more aimed at hitting the problem dead on. The President's plan only targets certain countries, such as Angola, Tanzania, Uganda Malawi, Mozambique, Rwanda, and Senegal. With my plan, all of the countries in S. America and S. Africa will be targeted, continuously over many years. The President's initiative does not mention using DDT, nor does it have an alternative in the cases of DDT resistance (or other insecticide resistance). It is not known right away when DDT resistance occurs, which is one drawback to the plan to use an alternative. The plan that I have proposed will not involve agents from the United States to go over to these countries. US involvement internationally will purely be a donation aspect. The plan will call for the US to purchase the treatments, DDT (along with supplies needed for spraying) and the pesticide treated nets. The treatments for those traveling into the United States will be purchased and administered in the US by agents of the US government. Though it may not seem reasonable to just send the supplies over without having US officials monitor their use and administration, it is much more cost efficient. The President's initiative has such an enormous cost mainly because it is incorporating the funding for US agents to administer the treatments and insecticides. Malaria is a problem in these developing countries, but it is also a looming problem. It has been there for a while, and it will still be around for a while. There are bigger issues at stake in the US than malaria and able bodied people can be put to better use. One such issue is the war in Iraq, where many soldiers are still needed. Another issue would be the Hurricane Katrina disaster. Many people are still without a home and there is only a few months left before they have to return their FEMA trailers. I strongly urge that there is an anti-malaria program, but it should not be costing as much American dollars as the President's Initiative and we should not be sending Americans over to help at this time.

BIO.G0.26.1,"Case Analysis for Jean ""Redhorse"" Osceola ",Biology,Report,"Our case analysis focused on a seventeen year old Navajo female, Jean 'Redhorse' Osceola, with Depersonalization Disorder. This analysis will begin with an in-depth summary of the disorder followed by an investigation into Jean's situation. This disorder is the third most common psychological disorder in the United States after anxiety and depression. Depersonalization Disorder can cause the person suffering to have anxiety, due to feeling detached from oneself. Additionally, feelings of anxiety can sometimes lead to Depersonalization Disorder. Depersonalization Disorder is a dissociative disorder that causes sufferers to experience feeling disconnected from their bodies. Individuals with this disorder state that it feels as if one knows what is happening during an episode but feels as if she is not the one experiencing it, as if she has dissociated from her own body. Occasional moments of depersonalization are not a threat to one's mental health, but a consistent feeling of depersonalization can interfere with daily life. Brief periods of depersonalization are brought on by acute stress, lack of sleep, or a combination of the two factors. The disorder often begins in the late teens to early twenties and usually resolves itself before the individual reaches age thirty. Depersonalization Disorder is quite concerning to the individual struggling with the mental illness, however, it is of no risk to society since the individual's grasp on reality is not harmed. Although Depersonalization Disorder is included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, some professionals remain skeptical to whether the disorder actually exists. The issue at the heart of this debate is the concept of dissociative identities and whether or not they are a direct product of social influence. Skeptics believe that dissociative disorders, such as Depersonalization Disorder, do not exist but are a manifestation of the social environment one is in. Some skeptics go as far as to say that those diagnosed with these disorders have ulterior motives and many simply have attention-seeking personalities. Clinicians often have a difficult time differentiating symptoms of Depersonalization Disorder from symptoms experienced by those diagnosed with schizophrenia, panic disorder, acute stress disorder, and recreational drug use. Jean was referred to her high school's social worker after she confided in one of her teachers that she felt like a robot and at times felt as if she could see herself standing outside of her body or floating above her body. When the social worker called in her mother to attend a meeting, the mother tossed out the idea of anything being seriously wrong with Jean. The mother believed Jean simply was not eating a good breakfast and that these periodic spells were insignificant. Jean, on the other hand, expressed concerned about these re-occuring episodes. The social worker questioned whether Jean was experimenting with recreational drugs and Jean replied with a no. Her mother then went on to explain how it is unacceptable for Navojos to drink giving the social worker some insight into Navajo cultural beliefs. I believe that the social worker responded properly to the information Jean confided in her teacher. By calling her mother into the conference, the social worker would be able to grasp a better understanding of where Jean was coming from and what her support system was like. However, as soon as the social worker realized that the mother was extremely skeptical that anything was wrong with Jean it would have been beneficial to end the conference and then meet solely with Jean. The way the mother stated how it is unacceptable for Navajos to drink was a clear sign of the societal pressure Navajo individuals, such as Jean, faced. Rather than go on asking Jean about alcohol or recreational drugs, the social worker could have spent more time talking to Jean about the diverging daily pressures she faced from her fellow Navajos and from her friends or classmates. Gaining a better understanding of the dominant cultural and societal factors that Jean deals with may have been a more appropriate strategy for understanding her mental illness. Nevertheless, the social worker did do a good job of diagnosing Jean with Depersonalization Disorder based on her episodes and her lack of hallucinations, voices, and feelings of depression. Most likely the social worker would have referred Jean to a professional who would have either given her weekly therapy sessions, prescribed her medications, or both. Although there is no particular drug or drug cocktail that is approved specifically for treating those with Depersonalization Disorder, those who are prescribed drugs usually receive antidepressants and psychotrophic medications. However, most drug cocktails focus on the anxiety, mood swings, and depression that are associated with Depersonalization Disorder. They focus on managing the disorder's symptoms and not the disorder itself. Consequently, medications may not be the best solution to Depersonalization Disorder since they do not deal directly with the issue at hand and therefore the chance of a full recovery is quite unrealistic. Like many mental illnesses, Depersonalization Disorder can serve as a kind of coping mechanism or defense mechanism that evolved during times of high stress or abuse, physical or mental. In this sense, therapy can be incredibly beneficial in empowering the individual suffering with the disorder. Therapy can help a person to acknowledge the pain they suffered and recognize that the abuse they experienced was not in any way their fault. It can validate repressed feelings and help a person realize their own potential and ability to be independent. Specifically, behavioral therapy can help one gain the confidence necessary to begin the process of recovery. Practicing acting out emotions and feelings rather than suppressing them allows one to gain the skills necessary to overcome this disorder. A full recovery from Depersonalization Disorder is far more realistic when the disorder itself is the focus of the treatment being administered, such as through a more feminist approach. A feminist approach would not see drugs as the solution to Depersonalization Disorder, but would acknowledge who Jean is and where she is coming from. Jean is Native American and a young women growing up in a society dominated by white, heterosexual males. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders fails to take into account the fact that she is more than just a female experiencing depersonalization spells. A professional might take the information he learns about Jean after one or two visits, match her symptoms up to the checklists listed in the DSM, and diagnose her with a mental disorder. The feminist approach, on the other hand, would reject this snapshot diagnosis. It refuses to accept that someone's current feelings and physical symptoms construct a complete representation of her entire mental condition. Instead, a feminist approach would take into account various events that occurred in one's life and interpret the influence they had on forming that person's self-identity. A feminist therapist would work with Jean to create a personalized model of recovery. The therapist's goals would include empowering Jean by focusing on ways that she feels oppressed and what stressors exist in her life. Growing up in a society that is dominantly white could be hard for a member of any minority and must be especially hard for someone of a stigmatized minority, such as Jean. The fact that Navajos are a self-respecting group of individuals who look down on things, such as drinking, considered the norm by the dominant culture could be a huge stressor in Jean's life. The feminist therapist may take into account the fact that she feels as if she is representing her people whenever she is out of her home. One part of her may feel the need to fit in and assimilate to the dominant culture while another part of her may feel committed to being a respected Navajo. Being this cautious of her own actions and always feeling as if she is the token for her minority could be a major influencing factor when it comes to her mental health. Her self-scrutiny could be reflected in her depersonalization episodes as her constant self-analysis is symbolized in the actual removal of herself from her physical body. The feminist therapist could use this knowledge to help empower Jean and provide her with the support to become comfortable with exploring her two identities. After gaining a better understanding of Jean's internalized struggles, the therapist can begin to help her redefine herself as an appreciated and productive member of both of her worlds. By explaining to Jean that she has already overcome so many obstacles, the therapist can focus on providing Jean with coping skills. Acknowledging that Jean is a women living in a male-dominated society forces Jean to recognize that she has already triumphed over incredible adversity and she has done this on her own. Additionally, the therapist can encourage Jean to see how far she has come regardless by providing her fact such as how the poverty rate among Native Americans is more than double that of the United States as a whole (25.9% versus 11.3% according to the 2000 Census) with a 46% unemployment rate. Jean needs to be empowered and the therapist can help her perform a positive self-assessment though the use of a feminist lens. When it comes to dealing directly with Depersonalization Disorder, the feminist therapist can provide Jean with connections to various support groups and Depersonalization Communities including those that focus on women. There is a great deal of advice out there written specifically by women for women who have suffered from Depersonalization Disorder. Some of it pertains to the effect hormones, due to PMS, pregnancy, Menopause, or the Pill, have on the emotions of someone suffering from this disorder. One piece of advice that has consistently proved beneficial is the keeping of a daily journal. This daily journal can track one's emotions as well as her Depersonalization symptoms. As a result, one's natural hormone cycle can be tracked and directly linked to intensified periods of depersonalization episodes, depression, and anxiety. This enables one to know what to expect and when, enabling someone living with or recovering from Depersonalization Disorder to live a more productive and less hindered life. Additional support can come from various counseling centers such as NAMI, the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill. NAMI is located in downtown Ann Arbor and provides confidential services to those suffering with a mental illness and friends and family members of persons with mental illness. NAMI support group sessions are facilitated by professional NAMI members who provide free of charge services to anyone interested.

BIO.G0.29.1,Sexual Selection and Male Sacrifice:  From Darwin until Now,Biology,Report,"In order to elicit copulation from females, males will often offer mating gifts as an enticement. Mating gifts, such as a juicy fly, are ultimately given to lengthen the time for sperm transfer, increasing the chance for paternity (Thornhill 1976). Andrade has shown that in Australian Redback spiders (Latrodectus hasseiti), the male gives the ultimate mating gift - his own body. There has been some resistance to the idea that being consumed during copulation could be an adaptive strategy for the male. This is not simply the case of a more dominant female overcoming the weaker male during copulation. A somersault behavior that has been observed in the field, in which the abdomen of the male is placed directly under the females mouthparts, has shown the males complicity in the cannibalism (Andrade 1996). This apparently suicidal behavior actually gives an adaptive advantage to the male and is favored by sexual selection for the paternal advantages gained (Andrade 1996). This review will show how the idea of sexual selection has been shaped throughout the past century and half since Darwin. It will follow Darwins idea through time, and show how it has allowed Andrade to come to the conclusion that male copulatory suicide is in fact an adaptive strategy, and further, will show how Andrade has come to influence the evolutionary community today. Sexual Selection was originally proposed by Darwin in The Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection in 1859. He stated that [Sexual selection] depends, not on a struggle for existence, but on a struggle between the males for possession of the females: the result is not death to the unsuccessful competitor, but few or no offspring. Sexual selection is an immediate competition for females in the ultimate battle to perpetuate ones genes. In 1871 Darwin expanded on this idea. He reasoned that in the struggle for mates, any characteristic that grants success will have a sexually-selective value. This sexually-selected trait will be perpetuated regardless of the natural-selective value of this same trait. Sexual selection could occur during female choice between rival males using male display-characters (otherwise known as inter-sexual selection) or could occur during combat between rival males (or intra-sexual selection) (Darwin 1871). Darwin had indirectly shown the two different selective forces acting during reproduction: natural selection and sexual selection. Sexual selection, unlike natural selection, has the ability to select for characteristics that are no longer advantageous for survival, but that have a high sexually-selective value. Fisher, in 1930, expanded upon Darwins ideas and predicted that when there is a display-based intra-sexual advantage among males, the reinforcement by female selection for this trait will initiate a run-away evolutionary process which will sometimes lead to characters deleterious in the general struggle for existence (Fisher 1930). According to Fishers run-away model, then, deleterious genes are able to evolve when females preferentially select for specific display-based characteristics via sexual selection. Huxley, in 1938, pointed out that the more intense the intra-sexual competition, the more likely it will be that characteristics that are deleterious to existence will evolve. This is because the intensity of selective advantage is more sharply graded by intra-sexual competition than by any other type of selection (Huxley 1938). This can be attributed to what he calls the fractional reproductive advantage, where the fitness of a trait is limited by the reproductive capacity of a singe female or to the all-or-nothing mating advantage where some individuals fail to secure mates at all. The all-or-nothing model has two components. The successful males may only obtain one mate, as in monogamous species, or they may be able to obtain more than one mate, exemplified by polygamous and promiscuous species. Only in the latter can characteristics that are deleterious to existence evolve (Huxley 1938). Although it may seem that natural selection would be able to eliminate such deleterious characteristics, they do in fact occur in nature (exemplified by the Australian Redback spider). In these cases, the genetic benefit gained by this characteristic (an increase in ones fertility) outweighs the phenotypic cost incurred (the loss of ones life). According to Bateman (1948), because a males fertility depends on the number of matings he gets, there would be selection for polygamous tendencies in males, producing an indiscriminate eagerness in mating. Females, on the other hand, would show a discriminating passivity (Bateman 1948). This can be seen in sexual selection. In a polygamous species there will be competition for these discriminate females. This can lead to characteristics that are sexually advantageous, but deleterious to existence, as previously hypothesized by Huxley. As a result of considerable competition for females, male parental investment will decrease while mating effort increases. Trivers, in 1972, hypothesized that because parental investment will lower the number of copulations a male can obtain, intra-sexual selection will offset the selection for increased parental investment, therefore decreasing male parental investment (Trivers 1972). Females, on the other hand, make a greater initial investment in their offspring and will have a greater selective pressure for parental investment. Discord between selection for low paternal parental investment and female preference for increased male parental investment has resulted in nuptial feeding (Thornhill 1976). The male can then occupy a female with the consumption of his mating gift, granting him an increased chance of a successful mating. An extreme example of nuptial feeding would be the mating gift of ones own body, as in sexual cannibalism. Although at the time there were not much empirical data, Buskirk in 1984 predicted that sexual cannibalism would only be observed in species where males normally expect few matings and in which cannibalism would increase the number of offspring produced from a mating. This is exemplified by the male copulatory suicides of the Australian Redback spiders (Latrodectus hasseiti). It was found by Andrade in 1996 that cannibalized males were able to copulate longer than those that were not eaten. When the female submits to copulation, the male performs a somersault behavior, in which the abdomen is placed directly under the females mouthparts (Andrade 1996). The female then proceeds to consume the male while copulation continues. This act of copulatory suicide is simply an extension of a mating gift; females will permit longer copulations when they are occupied by eating the male, therefore giving the male a longer time for sperm transfer to occur. Further, females were less likely to mate with another male after consumption of their first. This apparently suicidal behavior gives an adaptive advantage to the male. Because males are unlikely to be able to mate more than once even if they do survive copulation, the cost of being eaten is low and sexual cannibalism has been favored by sexual selection for the paternal advantages gained (Andrade 1996). Even though there is a direct benefit to the male, with a cost as great as ones life to mate, one would predict there to be selection for traits to allow them to escape cannibalism. Fromhage (2005) showed experimentally that opportunistic mating with females who are already feeding greatly reduces the risk of cannibalism. As a further benefit, when it is mechanically possible to copulate with a female that has already mated, the chance of fertilization of that females eggs is over 60 percent. This is an incredible success rate and one has to wonder why this strategy has not been selected for, and how there is such a high success rate given the shortened copulation duration. Snow in 2004 tested the assumption made by Andrade that sperm transfer is limited by copulation duration. Snow surprisingly discovered that the majority of sperm was transferred in the first five minutes of copulation. Increased paternity due to copulation duration could therefore be due to the transfer of nongametic ejaculatory substances or cryptic female choice. According to Snows research, cannibalism itself may even play a role in sperm transfer (Snow 2004). From the first idea of sexual selection proposed by Darwin only 150 years ago, Andrade was able to come to the conclusion that an action that seemed to be male copulatory suicide was actually an adaptive strategy to perpetuate ones genes. This idea, as well as that of Darwin and his predecessors, has already had its hand in further research. Further studies will need to be done to determine why opportunistic mating does not occur more often in nature if it is coupled with such a high success rate and exactly why copulation duration coincides with increased paternity when sperm transfer is limited to the first five minutes. Through this paper one can see - much like many of the complex behaviors that we observe today - how dramatically a single idea can evolve throughout time.

BIO.G0.30.1,Assessing selection hypotheses for the CCR5-delta32 mutation in Europeans,Biology,Report,"The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the causative agent leading to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), has become a pandemic that has devastated many regions of the world. Yet in some European populations, there is a mutation called CCR5-32 that confers almost complete protection against HIV in homozygotes and partial protection in heterozygotes. Many scientists suggest some force other than HIV has exerted positive selection for this mutation allele. Several hypotheses and models have been proposed as to how this mutation arose as well as how its frequency may have increased over time. This paper seeks to investigate the cause(s) of positive selection proposed by these hypotheses and models. The hypotheses and models of interest include: Duncan et als plague hypothesis, Galvani and Slatkins smallpox hypothesis, Balanovsky et als ecological factors model, and a Bronze Age hypothesis suggested by Sabeti et al and Hedrick and Verrelli. CCR5 is a transmembrane chemokine receptor that strains of HIV-1 use to enter immune cells such as macrophages and CD4 T-cells. A 32 base-pair deletion in CCR5 (called CCR5-32) prevents the expression of the CCR5 receptor on the cell surface (Duncan et al, 2005). The CCR5-32 mutation allele thus interferes with the ability of HIV-1 to infect immune cells. Other mutations in the CCR5 gene and genes of the chemokine receptor gene family also reduce infection rate, but their effects on HIV infection are significantly less compared to the effects of CCR5-32 (Balanovsky et al, 2005). Individuals homozygous for CCR5-32 have almost complete resistance to HIV-1 infection (Galvani and Slatkin, 2003; Balanovsky et al, 2005; Duncan et al, 2005). Heterozygous individuals for CCR5-32 have partial resistance conferring a 70% reduced risk of HIV infection compared to individuals without the mutation allele (Duncan et al, 2005). Heterozygous individuals who do become infected with HIV have a slow progression towards AIDS where onset is delayed for two to three additional years (Balanovsky et al, 2005). The frequency of CCR5-32 is estimated to be about 10%, on average, in European populations (Galvani and Slatkin, 2003; Balanovsky, 2005; Duncan et al, 2005). In addition, there is a north-south gradient in allele frequencies with the highest allele frequencies in northern European populations  about 16% in Finnish and Russian populations  and the lowest in southern European populations  about 4% in Sardinia (Balanovsky et al, 2005; Duncan et al, 2005). The CCR5-32 allele is found in low frequencies in regions neighboring Europe such as North Africa, the Middle East, and Central Asia (Balanovsky et al, 2005), but is absent in East and South-east Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and indigenous American populations (Balanovsky et al, 2005; Duncan et al, 2005). According to Balanovsky et al, this pattern is unusual for genes in human populations. In 1998, Libert et al determined the CCR5-32 mutation to be about 2000 years old using microsatellites linked with the CCR5 gene. Another study that same year by Stephens et al found strong linkage disequilibrium between two microsatellite markers and CCR5-32, showing the CCR5-32 mutation to be only about 700 years old (Balanovsky et al, 2005; Duncan et al, 2005; Sabeti et al, 2005). Despite this seemingly wide range in age estimates for CCR5-32, 95% confidence intervals in both cases span a few thousand years (Balanovsky et al, 2005). Some of the studies assessed in this paper appear to use the age estimate of 700 years old. Most studies on CCR5-32 believe this mutation has a single and recent origin in Europe where the frequency of this mutation increased dramatically from 0% to 10% in a historically short period of time. Balanovsky et al also state that such a dramatic increase in allele frequency in a large population cannot be due to random genetic drift. As a result, most studies also believe positive selection should be considered (Galvani and Slatkin, 2003; Balanovsky et al, 2005; Duncan et al, 2005). In 1998, Stephens et al hypothesized that a plague epidemic caused the rapid increase in the mutation frequency (Balanovsky et al; 2005). The Black Death between 1346 and 1352 killed up to 40% of Europes population and has been suggested to be this single plague epidemic (Galvani and Slatkin, 2003; Duncan et al, 2005). The bubonic plague was assumed to be the cause of the Black Death pandemic and after the Black Death, plague epidemics occurred approximately every 10 years for about 400 years (Duncan et al, 2005). A second pandemic known as the Great Plague in 1665 and 1666 killed 15-20% of Europes population, but after this pandemic the plague declined in Europe and virtually disappeared from Europe in 1750 (Galvani and Slatkin, 2003). Furthermore, the area where CCR5-32 is found today corresponds with the range of the plagues (Duncan et al, 2005). Because the plagues resulted in high mortality, there would be significant selection for any inherited plague-resistance-inducing factor (Balanovsky et al, 2005). While this hypothesis and model for the dramatic frequency increase of CCR5-32 is largely accepted, it has also recently fallen under heavy criticisms. Balanovsky et al point out that this hypothesis relies heavily on statistical analyses and that it has not been proven clinically or molecularly. According to Duncan et al, the Black Death would at most double the frequency of CCR5-32 from an initial frequency of 5x10-5 to 10-4. Galvani and Slatkin suggest that the indirect transmission from rodent reservoirs to humans via fleas explains the intermittent emergence of plague epidemics, and that this may further limit positive selection. Furthermore, the pathogen that causes the bubonic plague, the bacteria Yersinia pestis, does not use the CCR5 receptor to infect (Duncan et al, 2005). Duncan et al have thus hypothesized a modified version of the plague model. They suggest that an unknown virus that causes hemorrhagic fever with a 100% case mortality was the true pathogen responsible for the Black Death. This virus enters immune cells via the CCR5 receptor and the regular plague epidemics of Europes Middle Ages serve to dramatically increase the frequency of CCR5-32. The results of Duncan et als modeling show how the frequency of CCR5-32 could be dramatically increased from 10-5 to todays 10% through continuous selection pressure over 320 years due to this hemorrhagic fever virus. While the age estimate of 700 years coincides with the Black Death, Duncan et al acknowledge that the original CCR5-32 mutation likely arose much earlier. They mention a study where the rates of crossing over between the IRI3.1 microsatellite and CCR5-32 occurred about 3500 years ago, though they suggest the CCR5-32 probably appeared over 2500 years ago. Duncan et al also indicate that sporadic outbreaks of plague before the Black Death could have partly accounted for the increase in the CCR5-32 mutation allele. Finally, the plague largely disappeared in Europe after 1670; without any selective pressure, the frequency of CCR5-32 would decrease over the next 300 years as a result of genetic drift (Duncan et al, 2005). According to Duncan et al, smallpox and sustained plague in northeastern Europe could have accounted for its continued high frequency. Since the Myxoma poxvirus, a relative of smallpox, uses the CCR5 receptor to enter the white blood cells of rabbits, CCR5-32 would likely have provided at least partial resistance to smallpox in the 17th and 18th centuries, maintaining selective pressure almost until the emergence of HIV (Duncan et al, 2005). Furthermore, there is evidence that the hemorrhagic plague proposed by Duncan et al may have persisted in Scandinavia and Russia well after 1670, thus maintaining selective pressures in that region of Europe. This could also explain why the CCR5-32 allele is found in higher frequencies around Scandinavia and Russia. Although Duncan et als hypothesis appears plausible, it is very difficult to prove. Due the rapid decline of plague in Europe around the 18th century, the unknown virus that caused the plagues of hemorrhagic fever presumably no longer afflicts humans. Furthermore, there is not sufficient proof to support that the plagues ravaging across Europe for centuries was indeed due to this virus and not the bubonic plague. The greatest weakness in Duncan et als hypothesis, however, is that it is based on speculations about a virus that no longer exists and thus cannot be studied. Galvani and Slatkin proposed an alternative to the plague hypothesis. They believed that the plague epidemics and outbreaks occurred too intermittently to have applied consistent selective pressure to dramatically increase the frequency of CCR5-32. Galvani and Slatkin state that, while the plagues killed a significant percentage of Europes population at a given time, the total mortality from the plagues only impacted a small percent of Europes overall population across time. Thus, they suggested that smallpox is the selective pressure that caused the dramatic increase of CCR5-32. Galvani and Slatkin first stated that the direct person-to-person transmission of smallpox provided a far more continuous selective pressure. Smallpox epidemics were frequent and mostly affected children under ten-years-old; it was thus considered a childhood disease (Galvani and Slatkin, 2003; Balanovsky et al, 2005). Furthermore, smallpox had approximately a 30% fatality rate (Galvani and Slatkin, 2003) and since it affected children, the allele frequency changed over generations more effectively (Galvani and Slatkin, 2003; Balanovsky et al, 2005). Therefore, whereas the plague would result in strong but interspersed selection, smallpox results in weaker yet continuous selection. Galvani and Slatkins model shows that the age range of an affected population can affect the selection of a resistance allele when the population is afflicted episodically by a disease with a high mortality. A crucial point was that the initial frequency of CCR5-32, p0, was the same for both the bubonic plague and smallpox. When they assumed the resistance allele was dominant, the 400 years of bubonic plague epidemics did not provide sufficient selective pressure to drive the frequency up to 1%. In contrast, the more continuous smallpox mortality on European children could provide the necessary selective pressure in that time. When incomplete dominance was assumed, Galvani and Slatkin calculated that 1135 years of smallpox epidemics would have been required; this is well within the 95% confidence interval of the age estimate of 700 years provided by Stephen et al. Galvani and Slatkin further state that heterozygous fitness was important to how quickly evolution occurs in the case of a resistance allele, as most of the selection is through the heterozygotes when the frequency of the resistance allele is initially very low. Galvani and Slatkin thus believe the original CCR5-32 mutation originated 1000-2000 years ago in northern Europe and was then dispersed across Europe down a continuous gradient to the south via Viking conquests as proposed by Lucotte in 2001 (Balanovsky et al, 2005). Interestingly, smallpox also affected Scandinavia more than the rest of Europe, which could lead to its higher frequencies of CCR5-32 (Galvani and Slatkin, 2003). And again, smallpox is clinically more likely than the bubonic plague to cause the dramatic increase of CCR5-32 because of the differing modes of infection. Poxviruses enter immune cells via chemokine receptors like the CCR5 receptor, whereas the bubonic plague pathogen does not (Galvani and Slatkin, 2003; Duncan et al, 2005). But the smallpox hypothesis is not without criticisms. Balanovsky et al argue that the smallpox hypothesis also relies heavily on statistical analyses from historical accounts, and is not based on real clinical or molecular genetic data. Duncan et al mentioned that a lethal variant of smallpox did not arrive until around 1628 and before that date, smallpox was not reputed to be a serious malady. Thus the continuous selection provided by smallpox could only have been effective between about 1700 and 1830, and according to Duncan et als modeling, over 600 years of smallpox epidemics would be required to increase the frequency of CCR5-32 to 10%. A third hypothesis looked at ecological factors and what role they may have had in the distribution of the CCR5-32 allele. Balanovsky et al reasoned that some ecological factors, such as climate, could provide selective pressures in differing parts of the world. Balanovsky et al thus compiled a global database on CCR5-32 using data from 51 published sources, totaling 36,436 samples from 264 populations. They also included 3,784 samples from 35 populations in Russia, Ukraine, and Moldova for the first time. With such a large sample size, Balanovsky et al were able to construct an updated and more detailed map of CCR5-32 frequency distributions. In addition, Balanovsky et al also gathered data on the spatial distribution of atmospheric pressure, temperature, and precipitation for the first half of the 20th century before global warming. Based on this more detailed map of CCR5-32 distributions, Balanovsky et al found the highest frequency of CCR5-32 to be in the areas surrounding the Baltic Sea and subsequently decreasing gradually in all directions away from that region. Additional modeling modified the map distribution of CCR5-32 according to the clinal hypothesis and the diffusion from one center hypothesis. Balanovsky et al found strong correlations between the initial map and the maps modified for these two hypotheses. Additional correlation analysis found the correlation between temperature and CCR5-32 to be higher than all other climatic parameters. Balanovsky et al also further tested the second hypothesis by obtaining correlations between frequencies and the studied populations and their geographic distances from the CCR5-32 origin. Balanovsky et al admit that their study might be better used to reject, rather than prove, some hypotheses. As they acquired new data on CCR5-32 distribution, Balanovsky et al found that the correlation with climate actually decreased, though it still remained significant. They reason that, while the relationship between CCR5-32 and climate is not straightforward, it may play a part in selection, for example having an effect on plague in colder climates. Furthermore, Balanovsky et al asserted that gene flow, genetic drift, and migration cannot explain the continued high frequencies of CCR5-32 across Europe. While the Viking dispersal across Europe might have initially resulted in the gradient spread of CCR5-32, selection would have been required to maintain the frequencies in the European populations (Balanovsky et al, 2005). It is difficult to determine how much of an effect, if any, ecological factors had in the selection of CCR5-32. Balanovsky et al provided no mechanism or convincing reason why certain environmental factors would cause the frequency of CCR5-32 to increase over time, or what effect climate had on plague or smallpox. They also did not explain how the frequency of CCR5-32 could have been maintained after the Viking dispersal across Europe. Certainly, the hypothesis proposed by Balanovsky et al is weaker compared to either the plague or smallpox models. In a radical break from previous hypotheses asserting a single and recent origin, a study by Sabeti et al found CCR5-32 to be less remarkable as a mutation, whereas a study by Hedrick and Verrelli found CCR5-32 to be far older than previous thought. Sabeti et al carried out SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) genotyping around CCR5 in multiple populations. When the data was compared against the human genome and genetic maps, Sabeti et al found CCR5-32 was not unique in terms of genetic diversity relative to other variants at CCR5 or even throughout the human genome. They then assessed the high CCR5-32 frequencies by looking at the heterozygosity about CCR5 to further determine its genetic diversity; if a selection sweep has occurred, diversity would decrease, but if balancing selection occurred, then diversity would increase (Sabeti et al, 2005; Hedrick and Verrelli, 2006). If CCR5-32 was subjected to a selection sweep by positive selection, it would remove linked variants as its frequency increases in a population (Sabeti et al, 2005; Hedrick and Verrelli, 2006). Thus heterozygosity in SNPs near CCR5 should decrease, but when analyzed for recent directional positive selection and multiple selection sweeps at a locus, Sabeti et al did not find this to be the case. They assert that while these tests found no evidence of positive selection, it cannot be wholly ruled out. Furthermore, if the dramatic increase in CCR5-32 frequency was a relatively recent event, there should be high linkage disequilibrium near CCR5-32 (Sabeti et al, 2005; Hedrick and Verrelli, 2006). The linkage disequilibrium in regions distal (further away) to CCR5 showed similar frequencies to other CCR5 haplotypes, but regions proximal (near) to CCR5 showed higher disequilibrium (Sabeti et al, 2005; Hedrick and Verrelli, 2006). This may suggest that although the CCR5-32 allele might have increased recently, it might also be much older than previous studies. By analyzing DNA samples, a study by Hummel et al found similar frequencies of CCR5-32 in Bronze Age skeletons 2900 years ago and in modern Germans (Hedrick and Verrelli, 2006). In addition, Hummel et al did not find reduced CCR5-32 frequencies in a sample of 14th century plague victims, and thus might not have provided any protection against the plague. Using a new genetic map with 32 SNP markers closer to CCR5 increased the estimate age of CCR5-32 to about 5075 years, consistent with the Bronze Age data (Hedrick and Verrelli, 2006). Hedrick and Verrelli assert that the CCR5-32 allele was present long before either plague or smallpox could have exerted positive selection. The studies by Sabeti et al and Hedrick and Verrelli suggest that CCR5-32 is not as unique a variant as popularly believed and may in fact be older than previous estimates. While these two studies conclude that the original selection for CCR5-32 is older than previously thought, and with a lack of evidence for positive selection since, nothing can be ruled out. Furthermore, the findings by Hummel et al in 14th century plague victims who also possessed the CCR5-32 mutation allele does, however, support Duncan et als modified plague hypothesis or Galvani and Slatkins smallpox hypothesis in that CCR5-32 probably conferred no protection against the bubonic plague. More than anything, the data from these two studies present questions rather than answers. Each of the five studies addresses different hypotheses for the origin of CCR5-32 and its continued high frequencies in European populations. All the studies agree that the bubonic plague is probably not the source of selective pressure for CCR5-32. In refutation of this widely accepted hypothesis, each study attempts to create a new hypothesis and model that better explains the high frequency of CCR5-32 as well as its age estimate. All of the five studies have some compelling evidence to support their hypothesis, but can a synthesis between all five unite them into a single hypothesis? It certainly may be possible that each of the hypotheses represents only a piece of the whole. Both Sabeti et al and Hedrick and Verrelli state that nothing can be conclusively ruled out given CCR5-32s unique nature, despite its lack of uniqueness in terms of genetic diversity. Also, as CCR5-32 is a null allele that causes a loss in gene function, it would normally be subjected to purifying selection and removed from the population (Hedrick and Verrelli, 2006). CCR5-32 is, however, a unique null allele due to its selective advantage against HIV-1 although Sabeti et al found no evidence of positive selection before the emergence of HIV. Assuming CCR5-32 is about 5075 years old as reported by Hedrick and Verrelli, the original selection for CCR5-32 predates both the plague and smallpox. Duncan et al mentioned examples of several episodes of plague epidemics prior to the Black Death. Assuming the pathogen of these plague epidemics up through the 1700s is a virus that causes hemorrhagic fever with 100% fatality, as suggested by Duncan et al, it is plausible that this plague may have provided the original selective pressure. Selection could have been further affected by ecological factors such as a cold climate that may have altered the selection from plague epidemics, as suggested by Balanovsky et al. In addition, if CCR5-32 originated in the Baltic Sea area, it could very well have been dispersed by Vikings, providing the initial north-sound gradient. The intersection of the emergence of smallpox with the disappearance of the plague in Europe might have provided the required selective pressure to maintain CCR5-32 at high frequencies until the 20th century. The evidence cited by Duncan et al and Galvani and Slatkin, in which plague and smallpox persisted longer in northern European regions, could provide a means by which the north-sound gradient in CCR5-32 frequencies could have been sustained well after the Viking conquests.

BIO.G0.32.1,Mangrove Deforestation,Biology,Report,"Aided by the mass media, environmental groups and their celebrity endorsers have rallied public support for campaigns to end the destruction of two beautiful tropical ecosystems, the rainforests and the coral reefs. Likely due to the aesthetic sensory overload that these biomes deliver, Save the Rainforest and Save the Reefs movements enjoy substantial social prominence, and their logos are seen everywhere from tee-shirts to Ben-and-Jerrys ice-cream flavors. Meanwhile tropical mangrove forests, perhaps because their most abundant animal species are mud-dwelling crabs and the dominant plant-life consists of stubby trees, receive little attention, although the level of habitat degradation they experience is analogous to other tropical ecosystems. Virtually unnoticed by the public, approximately 35% of mangrove stands have been deforested since 1960. Already plant and animal communities have felt the direct consequences, and undoubtedly humans will soon. Mangroves refer to the shrub-like trees of the Rhizophoraceae family that uniquely inhabit the tropical zone between the latitudes of 25� N and 30�S, where they grow on the narrow coastal fringes between estuaries and the sea. By virtue of their location, large portions of their trunk and buttress-like aboveground root systems are daily submerged in water for the hours of high tide. These areas also serve as mixing grounds for river and ocean water, and subsequently the nutrients and organisms derived from the two ecosystems that are picked up and carried by these currents. This unique and nutrient-rich habitat has evolved to form a highly productive and extensive ecosystem which is estimated to cover 18 million hectares of the globe (Bowen et al. 2001). Scientists have classified 3 functional zones in every mangrove stand, which are each characterized by a different variety of mangrove. Fringe mangroves occupy tidal zones and therefore grow in full strength salt-water and daily receive the full brunt of the tides. Riverine mangroves grow along river banks and are flooded by freshwater and ocean currents. Basin mangroves grow behind the other zones and are less subject to tidal inundation. Because of this high water turnover mangrove forests teem with rich supplies of both land and sea-derived nutrients. Elevated levels of soil matrix aeration also arise due to constant mixing of river and sea currents. Several studies show that this aeration process results in the formation of a sponge-like soil complex which traps large quantities of sediment and nutrients. It follows that mangrove forests effectively intercept land-derived nutrients and pollutants and suspend them in the soil matrix, thereby preventing these compounds from reaching the ocean before being processed by nutrient-fixing bacteria. This cycle gives rise to a variety of different services, including high levels of nutrient processing and providing food for resident species. The services that mangroves provide are essential for preserving the integrity and biodiversity of this dynamic habitat. The diverse fauna that inhabit mangrove forests include: many fish and shellfish taxa, hundreds of species of birds, all sizes of reptiles, snakes, and even tigers (India) and manatees (Florida) (Bowen et al. 2001). In addition to supporting resident animal species, mangrove forests also provide several invaluable services to neighboring ecosystems. The spongy soil matrix and thick mesh-like root systems of mangrove trees also prevent the tides from eroding the coastline. Furthermore, their mere presence impedes destructive floodwaters from approaching inland areas. Mangroves also serve as buffers against the powerful winds of tropical storms, thereby sheltering inland ecosystems and coastal developments. As previously mentioned, mangrove forests absorb large quantities of bio-hazardous compounds from land sources that seep into rivers through groundwater runoff, thereby preventing these compounds from damaging nearby marine ecosystems like seagrass beds and coral reefs. In addition, the viability of these delicate marine ecosystems may actually be dependent on mangrove forests high productivity (Bowen et al. 2001). In their study of the link between mangrove forests and coral reef systems in the Caribbean, ecologist Peter Mumby and his colleagues discovered that large quantities of processed (i.e. digestible) organic material in the form of nutritive detritus are exported by mangrove forests via returning tides. Currents carry this detritus to local seagrass beds and coral reefs, where consumers have come to depend on their availability in order to feed. Mumby supports the hypothesis that coral reefs depend on the functionality of nearby mangrove forests by two key observations. First, per unit of biomass, mangrove forests have productivity levels similar to that of rainforests. Unlike rainforests, however, throughout the entire year mangrove forests maintain very low levels of leaf litter. Much of this detritus, Mumby determined, is washed out into the ocean, along with large amounts of nutrients. The second observation that supports the dependence hypothesis is that among the ten largest reefs in the Mesoamerican Coral Reef System (extending from Mexico to Belize) Mumbys team observed that the reefs that were the largest and had the highest levels of biodiversity and productivity were those with the strongest links to coastal mangrove forests. The strength of the link between the two communities was determined by the reefs proximity to the mangrove stand and the level of nutrient and organismal exchange between the two habitats (Arias-Gonzalez et al. 2004) However, despite the numerous benefits that functional mangrove forests provide and the evident inter-connectedness between mangroves and neighboring biomes, the deforestation of mangrove forests for land development and aquaculture (i.e. fish and shrimp farms) reasons has steadily increased over the last forty years. Ecologists currently estimate that global mangrove forest cover has decreased by 35% since 1960. Their destruction poses real dangers to both human and non-humans alike. The interruption of food webs due to habitat destruction has already caused the local extinctions of several fish and crustacean species. Furthermore, research suggests mangrove deforestation is likely to affect the functionality of dependent reef ecosystems. Coasts become vulnerable to sediment washout and increased levels of shore erosion. Large scale eutrophication in coastal marine environments where substantial areas of mangrove coverage have been cleared has already occurred, as levels of nutrient and land contaminant inputs increase, and loads of unfiltered chemicals are exported into the ocean, provoking harmful algal blooms which leave large anoxic dead zones in their wakes. The potential negative impact to human societies is great, as land developments and coastal cities are left exposed to receding shore lines, flooding, and the violent winds of tropical storms (Kaly 1998). Unfortunately, restoring devastated mangrove forests has proven difficult. Mangrove-based ecosystems are structurally complex, and have evolved over millennia around specific geographic components. For this reason, once a mangrove forest is cleared, restoring previous tidal patterns is difficult. This makes recreating and sustaining the salinity conditions to which previous mangroves and animal communities had acclimated also difficult. Finally, after a mangrove stand has been cleared for some time, the make-up of the soil (fundamental to ecosystem functionality) is irreparably altered. Presently, little work has been done to restore deforested mangrove stands. The majority of proposals to do so require the development of advanced biotechnologies. These efforts will undoubtedly go beyond the planting of several trees and may include: the reshaping of coastlines, chemical treatments to the soil, and purposeful reintroduction (in stages) of certain animal species (Farnsworth 1997). Because of the obvious difficulties that mangrove forest restoration poses, conservation efforts are clearly the best option. If we want to save coral reefs (and coastal cities), we should invest in saving the mangroves.

BIO.G1.03.1,Dispersal: a Review and Synthesis,Biology,Report,"Dispersal, the movement of individuals across a landscape, is an important process at multiple levels of ecology. The proximate and ultimate causes of dispersal are of interest to behavioral ecologists, who consider how dispersal may have evolved and the differential aspects of dispersive and non-dispersive individuals. The consequences of immigration and emigration on population dynamics are of import to population ecologists, exemplified by classic source-sink dynamics in which dispersal from a source population can maintain populations in sink habitats. Furthermore, community ecologists are interested in how dispersal allows species coexistence, and note that dispersal plays a key role in the development of community structure such as in succession. Population geneticists and evolutionary biologists also view dispersal as a critical process. Gene flow has various consequences, introducing genetic variation and preventing drift, homogenizing populations, and countering differential selective forces favoring local adaptation. Such evolutionary standards as founder effects require dispersal and colonization of new habitats, yet continued dispersal can prevent reproductive isolation between populations and subsequent speciation events. Conservation biologists are interested in dispersal from both an evolutionary and population ecological viewpoint. When the long-term goal of conservation is to maintain genetic diversity in populations in fragmented landscapes, the maintenance of dispersal and corresponding gene flow is crucial. Conservationists are often concerned with preserving appropriate habitat corridors to allow the rescue effect, or a trickle of dispersers serving to forestall extinction, in isolated populations (Brown and Kodric-Brown 1977). However, high rates of movement within a system may increase extinction risk by synchronizing the dynamics of local populations and thus increasing the probability of simultaneous crashes (Heino et al. 1997). Effective management of fragmented populations thus depends on an understanding of the processes and parameters of dispersal (MacDonald & Johnson 2001). Dispersal, in general, is the spreading of individuals away from each other (Begon et al. 1996). However, the definition of a specific dispersal event is confused in the literature, and often depends on an arbitrary scale (Johnson and Gaines 1990). For example, individual foraging movements are not considered dispersal, although the scale of the movement blurs this distinction (Bowler and Benton 2005). Consider, for example, a situation in which the next-closest foraging patch is a significant distance away; is the resulting change of locality a foraging movement or a dispersal event? Dispersal may also be contrasted with migration, which is a round-trip mass movement of individuals from one location to another (Sinclair 1983; Begon et al. 1996). However, many theoretical models use dispersal and migration interchangeably (Johnson and Gaines 1990). A definition of dispersal that was widely accepted in earlier ecological literature is the permanent movement an individual makes from its birth site to the place where it reproduces or would have reproduced if it had survived and found a mate (Howard 1960). Such a definition only refers to pre-reproductive movements of juveniles. Various authors have further made the distinction between natal and breeding dispersal (Greenwood and Harvey 1982, Li and Kuan 2006); natal dispersal is the movement from the site or group of birth to the site or group of first potential reproduction, and breeding dispersal refers to any subsequent movements between reproductive attempts (Greenwood & Harvey 1982). In this paper, I am going to focus on aspects governing natal dispersal, specifically regarding active emigration from a site. I will begin with a discussion of the costs of benefits of dispersal, followed by a catalogue of the proximate causes of dispersal and their corresponding ultimate selective pressures. I will discuss the nature of variation in dispersive behavior within a population, and conclude with suggestions for the future study of dispersal. All organisms disperse, although some species are more dispersive than others (Begon et al. 1996). The variation in dispersiveness of species depends not only on species' capability for movement, but also upon the selective forces favoring dispersal and those that make dispersal costly. Both individual and environmental factors play a role in determining the conditions under which an organism is likely to disperse (Ims and Hjermann 2001). The benefits of dispersal vary depending on the ultimate selective forces favoring dispersive individuals in different species. Gadgil (1971) discusses the evolution of dispersal, saying that in a very general way, the factor favoring evolution of dispersal would be the chance of colonizing a site more favorable than the one that is presently inhabited ⬦ An organism should disperse if the chance of reaching a better site exceeds the loss from the risk of death during dispersal or the chance of reaching a poorer habitat. Theory generally agrees with the prediction that the degree of movement is determined by the survival of dispersers relative to non-dispersers (Johnson and Gaines 1990, Gandon and Michalakis 2001). Gadgil's better sites may be defined by factors such as lower competition, more food, more reproductive chances, or less relatives. These environmental conditions will be discussed in more detail below. However, individual condition also determines dispersal capacity, usually through and individual's ability to overcome the costs of dispersal. Dispersal costs generally consist of reduced reproductive output or increased mortality (Rankin and Burchsted 1992). In making the decision to disperse, organisms may have to invest resources in dispersal morphologies, such as winged morphs (e.g. Sloggett and Weisser 2002). Furthermore, dispersive individuals face risks during the dispersal event, such as increased probability of predation or decreased availability of resources. The matrix through which the individual is moving also presents challenges if composed of unsuitable habitat, and mortality may occur before finding a suitable patch. The size of the patch, cues associated with suitable habitat, and the presence of conspecifics all may determine likelihood of finding a new patch (Lima and Zollner 1996). Finally, even if an individual survives a dispersal event, consequences such as loss of body weight may negatively impact reproductive fitness. Although the various selective forces on dispersal have received much attention from theorists, few empirical studies have actually quantitatively measured the costs and benefits of dispersal (Johnson and Gaines 1990). Indirect measures, such as counts of immigrant and emigrants, are often used to infer mortality rates (Waser et al. 1994). Tracking individuals is difficult, and often such studies do not consider how increasing distance increases the cost of dispersal (but see Baker and Rao 2004). The costs and benefits of dispersal depend not only on the occurrence of a dispersal event but also on the distance traveled (Baker and Rao 2004). In order to fully understand the selective advantages and disadvantages of dispersal, as well as how individuals make dispersal decisions, we need to develop methods and use empirical systems in which measuring the costs and benefits of dispersal is not intractably challenging. Intraspecific interactions, such as competition for food or mates, can select for dispersal in organisms. Increasing population density has been shown to increase emigration propensity in various organisms (positive density-dependent dispersal; e.g. Lena et al. 1998). Competitive interactions, including both exploitative and interference competition, reduce individual fitness in crowded populations (Greenwood and Harvey 1982, Bowler and Benton 2005), and positive density-dependent dispersal has been suggested as an outcome of such competitive interactions (McCarthy 1999). Deteriorating habitat quality may also select for positive density-dependent dispersal. For example, experimental food supplementation decreases the emigration propensity of juvenile northern goshawks (Kennedy and Ward 2003), and heavy host defoliation inflicted by high densities of goldenrod beetles seems to induce flight (Herzig 1995). Interestingly, a handful of studies have also found negative density-dependent effects on dispersal (Kuussari et al. 1996, Roland et al. 2000), suggesting that dispersal might be adaptive when the benefits of living in a group, such as diluted predation risk or facilitated foraging, exceed the costs of increased competition. Allee effects (Allee 1931), which cause a decline in fitness at low population densities, could also select for negative density-dependent dispersal (Bowler & Benton 2005, Travis et al. 1999). Positive density-dependent dispersal may also evolve in order to ultimately prevent kin competition, which would decrease inclusive fitness, as well as inbreeding (Gandon 1999). Hamilton and May (1977) used evolutionary stable strategy models to demonstrate that avoidance of kin competition may select for parents who enforce some offspring dispersal even under very high dispersal costs. Subsequent models (reviewed in Johnson and Gaines 1990) show that dispersive individuals both colonize empty sites and avoid inbreeding and competing with kin, which select for substantial dispersal in temporally stable environments. Thus, high relatedness between interacting individuals can be a proximate cause of dispersal (Bowler and Benton 2005). Such a cue requires the capacity to recognize relatives, especially the opposite-sex parent and siblings. For example, the mango shield scale (Milviscutulus mangiferae), a parthenogenic scale insect, experiences a reduction in reproductive fitness when two females share a host leaf; Kasuya (2000) showed that emigration rates increase significantly when two sisters are placed on a leaf together. Other studies have similarly shown that dispersal decisions are related to presence of kin in various taxa (e.g. Pusey and Wolf 1996, Lena et al. 1998). Sex ratio also may influence dispersal if mating success varies across patches due to differences in the number of mates, or if asymmetrical competition exists between males and females (Bowler & Benton 2005). For example, males of the hummingbird flower mite Proctolaelaps kirmsei have been shown to respond to stochastic changes in the local sex ratio by moving from male-biased groups to female-biased groups (Colwell and Naeem 1999), which would increase the males' chances of acquiring mates. Similar to intraspecific effects, interspecific competition may select for dispersal by reducing resource availability. In addition, interactions with other guilds, such as parasites or predators, may determine the fitness of an individual in a particular patch (Weisser et al. 2001, Bowler and Benton 2005). For example, alate (winged morph) production in the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum can be induced by the presence of a predators (ladybirds) as well as parasitoids (Aphidius ervi; Sloggett and Weisser 2002). Such enemy-induced dispersal has not been considered for many species (Bowler and Benton 2005). One of the earliest models that explored condition-dependent dispersal as an adaptive strategy showed that high spatial variability in habitat quality selects for density-dependent dispersal (Gadgil 1971). Temporal variability in the environment can also be a selective factor for dispersal (Gandon and Michalakis 2001). Longer habitat persistence decreases dispersal propensity (Travis and Dytham 1999). In addition, patch size and shape are important proximate causes for dispersal. Patch size often displays a negative correlation with emigration rate (e.g. for butterflies, Baguette et al. 2000), and is thought to influence dispersal via edge-to-size ratios: likelihood of emigration from a small patch increases because individuals encounter edges more often in small patches (Stamps et al. 1987). Patch size is also correlated with carrying capacity, which may explain greater emigration from small patches; Andreassen and Ims (2001) showed that dispersal from a patch was greater when population density was low and more variable, which may be indicative of a lower carrying capacity due to a low quality habitat. Although a single species' dispersal ability and propensity can often be generally characterized, there is considerable variation within species as to which individuals disperse. Sex-biased dispersal tends to be the norm in many bird and mammal species, with female birds and male mammals undergoing dispersal (Greenwood 1980). As mentioned previously, dispersal may be sex-biased in order to avoid inbreeding (Perrin and Goudet 2001). In this case, there may be selective pressures to disperse before sexual maturity, meaning that the developmental stage of an individual changes its propensity to disperse (Bowler and Benton 2005). Dispersiveness of an individual also depends on differential costs and benefits to dispersing at different life stages, for example, younger individuals may be inferior competitors and therefore more likely to emigrate to a new, lower-density patch (Bowler and Benton 2005). Finally, body condition is an important factor in an individual's dispersive ability. Smaller, competitively inferior individuals may emigrate first to escape competition (Lena et al. 1998). Often, however, dispersal success depends on the organism having adequate resource reserves, and thus larger individuals in better condition are more physically capable of dispersal (Lena et al. 1998). In addition, large individuals may better be able to enter a new competitive patch as a dominant individual. These differences among individuals highlight the importance of considering the traits of dispersers in the context in which they are moving (Bowler and Benton 2005). Most approaches so far have focused on either the causes or consequences of dispersal, but few studies consider what happens during the dispersal event (Wiens 2001). The path organisms take during dispersal is essential to understanding how landscapes modify dispersal behavior, especially in light of habitat fragmentation. Individual-based simulation models of dispersal in spatially complex landscapes (e.g. With and Crist 1995) have advantages for the development of empirical hypotheses as well as in conservation applications, but such models require data for accurate parameterization. For example, failure to account for changes in search tactics and dispersal speed can change the implications of management strategies in fragmented landscapes (Zollner and Lima 2005). An emphasis on empirical studies of the dispersal process, including the influence on landscape on decision-making, should be encouraged. We need to know how organisms cope with risks encountered during dispersal and how conditions at various scales influence their probability of success (Wiens 2001). As Lima and Zollner (1996) suggested a decade ago, we need to develop a behavioral ecology of ecological landscapes, in which behavior is considered on a landscape-level scale, in order to determine how an organism uses the information available in the environment to make decisions regarding movement in that environment. A better awareness of the behavior of dispersing animals will allow a determination of the factors that limit dispersal success and ultimately improve how we understand the ecological and evolutionary consequences of dispersal.

BIO.G1.06.1,Temp effects on nitrogen mineralization,Biology,Report,"Temperature increases due to global warming have the potential to seriously impact the function, productivity, and composition of ecosystems. In order to gain a better understanding of the potential changes caused by warming, it is necessary to understand the impacts on essential processes, especially soil processes. Here we analyzed the impact of warming on the rate of nitrogen mineralization across biomes to help provide a framework to predict changes in NPP and NEP. Regardless of ecosystem type, increasing temperatures result in increases in N-mineralization rates provided that water is not limiting. Nitrogen will then become more available to plants, and is predicted to lead to increases in NPP, especially in currently N-limited ecosystems. Ultimately, to predict with certainty the ecosystem impact on a global scale, more research is needed on a greater number of biome types, and also on interactions between soil and plant processes. While the phenomenon of global warming is gaining increasing support in both the scientific realm and in the media, uncertainty exists about the possible effects of temperature shifts on a global scale. Theory and models have proposed changes on the scale of nominal to catastrophic in many areas of biology, including major effects on climate and weather patterns, losses of biodiversity, drastic changes in community structure and ecosystem composition, and changes in ecosystem function. It may even act to alter speciation and extinction rates, and alter evolutionary trajectories of plants and animals due to the expected changes in environment. Global warming has been predicted to increase average temperatures from 1 to 3.5 degrees Celsius over the next 50 to 100 years [1]; although some predictions are much higher. Temperature is a key factor for soil processes such as decomposition and nitrogen mineralization, as well as plant processes such as photosynthetic rate, plant productivity, and nutrient uptake. Temperature effects from global warming are predicted to be more variable in space and time than the effects of elevated atmospheric CO2, as temperature will be more heterogeneous on the landscape level. Factors such as local geography, latitude, and elevation will impact temperatures, whereas the atmospheric CO2 concentration is roughly uniform. Additionally, a stronger response to warming is predicted to occur in higher latitudes, or ecosystems that are currently colder [1, 2]. Temperatures also fluctuate on daily and seasonal scales, further adding to the variability in temperature-related impacts on processes such as N-mineralization. Variability in temperatures (and the resulting impact on ecosystem processes) highlights the need for a large amount of site-specific research. Because so many variables will be altered, a holistic approach to understanding and predicting these consequences is impractical. In order to begin to appreciate how an increase in temperature may affect ecosystem structure and function, it is necessary to start at the ground level by examining soil processes that control net primary productivity (NPP), which in turn controls net ecosystem productivity (NEP). Specifically, it is imperative to understand the direct effect of temperature and the indirect effects of related changes in soil moisture and CO2 concentration on rates of nitrogen mineralization. In most ecosystems, nitrogen (N) is the key limiting resource, thereby exerting direct control over NPP and influencing NEP. Human activity, through fertilization and the burning of fossil fuels, has both contributed to increased additions of N into terrestrial nutrient cycles, and spurred global warming. Because ecosystems vary in so many biological and geochemical aspects, and results from warming experiments are so varied, to fully understand the effects on NPP and NEP due to elevated temperatures and N-mineralization, it is useful to categorize the data into biome-groups. Here, we examine temperature effects on N-mineralization in high-N (tropical forests), medium-N (temperate forest and grasslands), and low-N (arctic tundra and boreal) ecosystems [3] in order to gain insight into the possible effects of increased temperature from global warming on NPP, which will ultimately contribute to changes in NEP and ecosystem biodiversity. We predict that while there will be a large amount of variation in ecosystem response, overall NPP will increase under elevated temperatures due to increases in N-mineralization rates. Overall nitrogen availability may increase (possibly to excess), which has the potential to lead to very negative impacts, such as nitrogen saturation, shifts in dominant species and reduction of species diversity, and also shifts in ecosystem type (for example, from species-rich heathlands to species-poor forest or grasslands); species losses have the potential to make the system less stable or resistant to disturbance, such as drought or fire [4]. Both experiments and models have been used to understand the effects of elevated temperature on N-mineralization, but predictions for ecosystem response are difficult due to the long-term scale of the change, and the complexities of the underlying interactions. The nitrogen cycle is inherently complex due in part to the highly specific microorganisms involved in N-mineralization; this has given rise to variation and discrepancies in reported results of simulations [2, 5]. Additionally, models differ in their underlying assumptions of the relative importance of plant physiological processes versus soil nutritional processes. Those emphasizing the former predict a decrease in plant productivity under warming due to a decreased stomatal conductance, whereas those emphasizing the latter predict an increase in productivity due to greater N-mineralization [2]. Here we will focus on experiments and models emphasizing soil processes, as we propose that N-mineralization is the most important process determining changes in NPP in response to global warming. The general consensus of experimental results and models shows that with increasing temperature, rates of N-mineralization will increase. There is however, a large amount of variation in the magnitude of the effect, and some studies do not support this trend [1, 2, 5-7]. Of great importance for predicting response are the initial conditions of the ecosystem: primarily, soil moisture content, and the dominant form and relative availability of nitrogen in the soil. For example, in the results of their model, Medlynet al[2] showed an initially large increase in NPP, then a smaller but long term increase in NPP. Plant physiological responses were shown to be important for the short-term increase in NPP, but the medium and long-term increases were due to stimulated N-mineralization rates from increases in both soil and air temperatures. However, the study made the assumption that water availability was not limiting NPP. In a meta-analysis of 32 warming experiments from a variety of latitudes, Rustadet al[1] found that overall, warming contributes to increases rates of N-mineralization. Warming significantly increased rates of N-mineralization across ecosystem types, which led to significant increases in above-ground biomass. Different types of ecosystems responded quite differently, with increases in productivity highest in tundra and lowest in grassland. Rustadet al[1] also found that there were significant positive relationships between mean net N-mineralization, mean annual precipitation, and mean temperature, highlighting the importance of soil moisture for sustaining increases in mineralization rates. Additional studies also demonstrate the importance of soil moisture on rates of N-mineralization. Niklinskaet al[6] found that the rate of organic matter decomposition of forest ecosystems depends primarily on temperature and humidity, and N-mineralization rates were positively correlated to temperature. Leiroset al [5] also found that increased temperature and moisture levels increased N-mineralization rates and that the temperature-moisture interaction significantly influenced mineralization rates. It was also noted that the effect of a 2-degree increase in temperature was roughly countered by a concurrent 10% decrease in soil moisture content. Clearly, in ecosystems with water limitations, this coupling between increased temperature and decreased moisture will have strong impacts on mineralization rates, and therefore on NPP. Pendallet al[7] also found N-mineralization rates to be stimulated by increases in temperature, and proposed that this may act as a positive feedback on plant productivity. However, the extent of the increase of mineralization was dependent on the type of soil: upland soils were likely to experience drying, which could result in mineral immobilization and reduction of decomposition. In contrast, in wetlands, drying could result in increased aerobic respiration and decomposition as water tables were lowered. But, in any type of system, drying could be alleviated if elevated CO2 reduces transpiration rates. Most models agree that elevated temperatures will decrease soil moisture, whereas elevated CO2 will increase moisture. It is unclear how their interaction will affect actual moisture availability, but it is likely to depend on both ecosystem type and species composition. While temperature has been shown to increase N-mineralization rates, there is a maximum to the effect. Twenty-five degrees Celsius has been shown to be the optimal temperature for maximizing N-mineralization [5]. So, while there are many areas and ecosystems where there would be a net increase in NPP due to increased N-mineralization rates, areas where the temperature was pushed beyond 25 degrees Celsius may experience a net decrease in mineralization rates. Additionally, some ecosystems could experience a shift from net immobilization (i.e. negative net mineralization) to zero or positive net mineralization due to global warming. Niklinskaet al[6] found that experimentally warming soils from northern European Scots pine forests caused a switch in one site from net immobilization to net mineralization. The ramifications of this type of biochemical shift are potentially very strongin this forest system, there could be more than double the current rate of nitrogen turnover during the growing season. Nitrogen-rich ecosystems are typically tropical forests or agricultural systems. It is crucial to understand the impacts of temperature increases due to global warming on tropical forests as they account for approximately 43% of global NPP, and 27% of the carbon stored in forest soils [8]. However, relatively little research has been conducted to determine temperature effects on N-mineralization rates in tropical soils, perhaps due to the general belief that the larger effects of global warming will be seen in higher latitudes and colder ecosystems. However, the high rates of soil respiration in tropical systems are very sensitive to small changes in temperature, so large effects could be seen even if the temperature increases are relatively small [9]. In humid or wet tropical systems, the climate is nearly constant throughout the year, so even minor temperature changes could have drastic impacts, and in the dry tropics, temperature changes could alter the frequency of disturbance (drought, fire), which would have large impacts on both NPP and N-mineralization rates [8]. In tropical forests, N-mineralization rates have been shown to increase with increasing temperature [10]. However, in these systems, phosphorous tends to be the limiting resource for plant growth, not nitrogen [8]. Therefore, when phosphorous is limiting, increases in N-mineralization rates will not lead to increases in NPP. Townsendet al[9] found increases in the turnover times of soil organic carbon in tropical forest systems, and models for the Amazon basin predict increases in carbon storage [11]. However, trees grown under elevated CO2 showed no increase in concentrations of lignin, nitrogen or carbon, and there was no effect on decomposition (temperature itself was not tested; [12]. It has been predicted that for tropical systems, if NPP does initially increase under global warming conditions, those increases could lead to changes in litter quality, reducing the nutrient content and ultimately leading to a reduction of NPP [8]. Currently, there are tropical forest systems that are both water and non-water limited. Projections on the effects of global warming on climate and weather patterns are varied so it is not clear if increased temperatures will cause lower water availability. Increased temperatures themselves are predicted to decrease soil moisture availability and rainfall, which would therefore lower N-mineralization rates; however, CO2 fertilization can increase water use efficiency in plants, and may therefore increase soil moisture [8]. Dry tropical forests could experience prolonged drought, which would also reduce N-mineralization rates; both factors would therefore lower NPP. However, there could be an increase in precipitation, which would then increase N-mineralization and NPP [8]. Another problem with predicting rates of N-mineralization under higher temperatures for tropical systems stems from the problem of weather pattern shifts. Hurricane frequency, for example, may increase or decrease, but both possibilities will impact successional states of the forests, which will in turn impact nutrient cycling: N-mineralization tends to increase through secondary rainforest succession [13]. Lastly, human use of tropical forests, specifically slash-and-burn agriculture, will change nutrient availability in the system, which will then impact the rates of N-mineralization. These practices ultimately remove nitrogen from the system, which would have the obvious impact of slowing mineralization rates. In summary, it is very difficult to predict the impact of global warming on NPP for tropical forests. N-mineralization will increase with temperature, but due to phosphorous limitations, and potentially large changes in water availability and climate patterns (we will ignore human use at this point), it is difficult to know the magnitude and direction of change for NPP. In many cases temperature, moisture availability and substrate properties may play a more important role in controlling soil respiration rates than area vegetation type [14]. This is not to say that vegetation type is unimportant. Respiration rates do vary with vegetation, and it has been shown that vegetation affects soil respiration through influences on soil microclimate and structure, the quantity and quality of detritus supplied to soil, and by the overall rate of root respiration [14]. The studies reviewed by Raich and Tufekcioglu [14] indicate that soil respiration rates vary among different temperate forest types. In the studies reviewed, soil respiration rates in coniferous forests were found to be lower than those in broad-leaved forests existing on the same soil types. Rather than a direct effect of temperature though, this study suggests that the difference is likely due to the variation in plant litter quality (N and lignin content). Both mechanisms could operate within a single system, but over different time scales. One example of this scenario is the temperate forest warming study in Harvard Forest, MA. Initially, with a 5� C increase in soil temperature, soils experienced faster decomposition and overall C loss [28]. Over the long-term, however, N is taken up by biomass with a higher C:N ratio than soil, resulting in C storage but no change in ecosystem N. This is due to the ammonium economy of the system; mineralized N that becomes nitrified has the potential to be leached from the soil. Finally, without extraneous inputs of N, the system reaches equilibrium such that biomass no longer accumulates, and increases in respiration may result in overall C loss. Existing scientific literature also strongly points to the influence of soil temperature and moisture content on respiration rates, such that changes in precipitation induced by global warming can alter C and N cycles. Ultimately, primary productivity and decomposition rates are strongly linked processes that are controlled by primarily by temperature, moisture availability and substrate quality [14]. There is strong evidence suggesting that forest disturbances influence nutrient availability (C and N most significantly) in the ecosystem. Climate change will likely have an impact on forest disturbances in various and unpredictable ways. Alterations in temperature may mean greater variability in annual climatic events. Some models predict more and prolonged periods of drought. Other models suggest that we may expect heavier rainy seasons with increased flooding and landslides. This range of possible increased numbers and severity of disturbance events may lead to unpredictable results [15]. For example, when an ecosystem experiences combinations or series of disturbances, it may not have sufficient recovery time from an initial disturbance before the next disturbance occurs. This phenomenon of reduced recovery time may lead to new and unforeseen long-term conditions. Increased variability in wet/dry season fluctuations may lead to a big increase in biomass in some years that experience higher than normal precipitation. Then, if several drought years follow, there is an unusually large amount of dead organic matter as a consequence of decreased NPP, decreased decomposition resulting in the potential for massive forest fires which may lead to a net loss of nutrients in the ecosystem. Increased temperatures may lead to increased rates of evapotranspiration, causing moisture stress in the forest ecosystem. Some models suggest that this mechanism may cause future increases in drought in the Southeast, Southern Rockies and parts of the Northwest in the United States. Some fire history studies though suggest that there may be a decrease in fire disturbances if precipitation rates increase but high precipitation rates can lead to increased landslides and flooding as well. High latitude tundra and boreal ecosystems are considered nitrogen poor environments. In these regions low temperatures and wet soil conditions inhibit decomposition, and it is the slow release of N and P from organic matter that limits NPP [16-20]. Despite low NPP, high latitude soils account for a third of the worlds terrestrial organic carbon [21]. The size of this carbon sink is directly proportional to rates of change in NPP and carbon residence time as controlled by decomposition [21]. With warmer conditions decomposition rates should increase, thus these stores represent a potential positive feedback for global warming if they are decomposed and respired into CO2 and CH4 . Rates of N mineralization have been shown to increase with temperature as well [22]; since both decomposition and plant productivity are nutrient limited, warming has the potential to further stimulate decomposition and increase NPP [23]. However, this simple framework does not account for the long-term effects of plant community composition on rates of decomposition and N-mineralization. Several long-term studies at Abisko, Sweden and Toolik Lake, Alaska have demonstrated that fertilization, which increases nutrient availability to plants, elicits significant changes in tundra plant communities in either NPP or in structure and function [24-27]. For example, Alaskan tussock tundra systems are typically dominated by roughly equal biomass of graminoids, deciduous shrubs, evergreens, and with intertussock areas covered by mosses [28]. However, fertilization of tussock tundra for several decades has led to an increased abundance of deciduous shrubs, and a decrease in mosses and evergreen shrubs [24, 25]. Similar long-term experiments at Toolik Lake have directly manipulated temperature; the effects on plant communities are less extreme, but generally follow the same trends as the fertilizer experiments, with species shifts presumably driven by increased nutrient availability [24, 29]. Plant community composition is an important determinant of decomposition and nutrient cycling rates: In Alaskan taiga systems, faster decomposition rates in birch versus spruce forests were observed despite warmer temperatures in the birch forest, and differences in decomposition rate among tundra species can be greater than the effect of a 6� C increase [18, 21]. Therefore, replacement of relatively high quality litter, such as that from graminoids, by more lignified low quality litter, like shrub stems, may negatively affect decomposition rates and nutrient cycling in contrast to the positive effects of temperature, rendering the effects of warming on NEP and carbon storage uncertain [18, 24]. Furthermore, even if soil organic matter turnover and N mineralization increases with warming over the short term, there is potential for redistribution of nitrogen from soils (low C:N) to shrub biomass (high C:N) over the long term, resulting in net C storage [30]. It must be noted that warming-induced plant community composition shifts across the Arctic are not ubiquitous; in contrast to the tussock dominated tundra systems, plant response to warming in the low biomass Arctic heath system at Abisko was an increase in NPP without any significant changes in species composition [27]. There are numerous other factors besides shifts in plant community composition that further confound our ability to predict the long-term effects of global warming on NEP in high latitude regions. Warming is anticipated to increase permafrost depth, allowing microbes access to deeper stocks of organic material, but the degree and distribution of permafrost thawing remains uncertain. Climate models universally predict an increase in temperatures across the Arctic, but there is no consensus on whether summer precipitation will increase or decrease. Precipitation is important because soil moisture influences the responsiveness of decomposition to temperature [31]. Decreasing soil moisture, particularly in saturated wet meadow tundra habitats, would increase decomposition rates and N-mineralization as soils become oxygenated [32]. Another consideration is the effect of warming on seasonal nutrient and carbon dynamics. One effect of temperature on seasonal dynamics occurs through increased winter snow cover brought about directly through changes in precipitation or indirectly through shrub growth, which trap snow beneath them [33]. Snow insulates the ground and elevates soil temperatures, resulting in unfrozen water pockets that in turn stimulate microbial activity and enhance N-mineralization [34]. This phenomenon may provide a positive feedback for shrub growth as well, since higher nutrient availability following the spring thaw favors shrub growth [24, 35]. Ultimately, to predict the effects of warming on NEP we must better synthesize our knowledge of plant physiology, soil processes, temporal and spatial dynamics, and changes in climate patterns. Across ecosystem types and biomes, research has shown that increases in temperature (and CO2 concentration) cause increases in rates of N-mineralization (although there is variation and contradictory results). However, these rates are limited by other factors such as moisture availability and quality of the substrate. Clearly, such increases can potentially lead to increases in NPP and therefore NEP. There is, however, a maximum to these increases; ecosystems with temperatures pushed past the optimum temperature for mineralization will likely show decreases in NPP and NEP. With these changing conditions and changes in NPP, community structure is likely to change due to the relative competitive abilities of plants under different light, temperature, and nutrient conditions. Currently our predictive powers are limited: interactions among different soil and plant physiological processes are quite complex, and little is known about the outcomes of these interactions. N-mineralization is one process, which in nature does not act alone; mineralization rates will be impacted by other processes, and these effects may not be linear (and therefore difficult to predict). Weather patterns are predicted to become more variable and severe; drastic changes in amounts of available precipitation and disturbances will greatly impact ecosystem function and productivity, which will obviously change NPP and NEP. As always, there is a need for more research, both on the effects of interactions between processes, and on processes in more ecosystem types (for example, little work has currently been conducted in desert systems).

BIO.G1.08.1,"Boc, sonic hedgehog and commissural axons",Biology,Report,"Scientists discovered that Shh could function as a diffusible attractant similar to Netrin-1, but its binding receptor was unknown. Cdon and Boc were very good candidate receptors in terms of their protein structures, expression period, mutant phenotypes and properties of homologue proteins in Drosophila. In this paper, the authors examined the two candidates and found that Boc was expressed by commissural neurons and disruption of Boc in mouse resulted in the misguidance of commissural axons. In addition, Boc could bind specifically to Shh and RNAi knockdown of Boc prevented the rat commissural axons from turning towards an ectopic source of Shh in vitro. Therefore, the authors concluded that Boc was a receptor for Shh in the guidance of commissural axons. First, the authors examined the expression pattern of Cdon and Boc in E11.5 mouse spinal cord. They examined RNA expression by in situ hybridization in normal mice and reporter-gene expression in Boc and Cdon mutant mice. They found that Cdon and Boc were expressed in dorsal ventricular zone and Boc extended more ventrally and laterally. The overlap of expression sites of Boc and Robo3/Rig-1 revealed that Boc expression encompasses the region where commissural interneurons initiated their differentiation. In addition, PLAP reporter driven by Boc promoter labeled the axons projecting to the floor plate and was co-expressed with TAG1, which also suggested that Boc mRNA was expressed in differentiating commissural neurons. Moreover, they labeled Boc protein expression in cell bodies, axons and growth cones of dissociated commissural neurons in vitro using antibodies against Boc. Then, they tested the commissural axon guidance in Cdon and Boc homozygous mutant mice E11.5 embryos. Cdon mutant mice had normal axon projections, while Boc-/- mice had similar phenotype with the mice after conditional removal of the Shh signaling mediator Smo in the commissural neurons, the axons of which were dispersed and invaded the ventral spinal cord with ectopic projections extending over the motor columns. This suggested that Boc might in the same pathway as Smo to guide commissural axons in response to Shh. In addition, they examined whether Boc could bind directly to Shh. First, they expressed Boc-GFP and a variety of control proteins in COS cells, assaying them for binding to Shh and the results showed that Boc could bind to Shh specifically. Then quantitative assessment of the affinity of these interactions using Shh-AP revealed a Kd similar to that between netrin-1 and DCC. Besides, purified N-Shh bound to the affinity-purified ectodomains of Boc with the same affinity as to COS cells expressing Boc, suggesting the interaction between Shh and Boc is direct. Furthermore, deletion analysis implied that Shh-binding activity of Boc was attributed to the third FNIII domain. Moreover, they tested the function of Boc in Shh-mediated axon turning in vitro. The siRNA against rat and mouse Boc was electroporated into dorsal region of rat spinal cord explants, which later co-cultured with COS cells expressing Shh or netrin-1. Commissural axons from explants transfected with siRNA against Boc responded normal to netrin-1 source, but did not turn towards Shh source. In addition, co-electroporation of human Boc rescued normal Shh-mediated attraction. Collectively, I think the results convincingly demonstrate that Boc is required as a receptor for commissural axons to respond to the chemoattractive effect of Shh. It is a pity that the paper can not test the Boc protein expression on commissural axons in vivo and in the last commissural axon turning assay, it can not examine directly on explants from Boc mutant mice that previously used. Besides, it might be more convincing if they can show more merging pictures of Boc-/- with co-expression PLAP reporter and TAG1 as shown in Fig2 and supplementary Fig2f. Because although they did statistic data on TAG1/total area in 10 sections, no statistic data were shown to prove that in all examined TAG1+ axons were supposed to express Boc mRNA. In addition, it might be more convincing to directly calculate the proportion of axons that did not reach the floor plate instead of proportion of area. However, I guess it is very difficult. The paper opened several interesting questions. For instances, how Boc mediates the Shh signaling pathway during axon guidance? What is the role of Smo in this pathway, if any? Besides, since we now know that netrin-1 and Shh are responsible for attractive effect in spinal cord during development, are two of them sufficient? To answer this question, we could make mice with double knockout Netrin-1 and Boc to see whether the embryo spinal cord still have commissural axon projection toward floor plate. We could also RNAi knockdown one gene expression in mutant mice with another gene KO and use the in vitro axon turning assay, if it could be successful in mutant mouse explants. Last, since Shh contributes both to cell fate specification and axon guidance, are these two roles related to each other? For instance, is that possible that the binding of Shh on Boc also induces the signaling pathway that further strengthens the original cell fate? Or is that possible that Shhs effect on cell fate specification meanwhile inhibits the expression of Boc, which block the guidance effect of Shh on them?

BIO.G2.02.1,Modularity and the Evolution of Complex Systems,Biology,Report,"In my first paper for Complex Systems this term, I discussed Kauffman's theory of autocatalytic sets, which proposes, among other things, that given enough different pre-organic molecules floating around in the puddles and ponds of the early earth, it was nearly certain that life would emerge from the brew. By strength of numbers, even the limited catalytic potential of unevolved peptides or polynucleotides would eventually pass a collective critical threshold and produce a self replicating system.i In this framework, each and every molecule in the system is a necessary cog - at the outset, the loss of any one produces a catastrophic failure. As time went on, this set of unique and individually critical components could evolve in response to changes in the environment and, over time, perhaps produce life as we know it. Life as we know it, however, does not consist of a system of completely interconnected, equally indispensable parts. Rather, organisms, especially multicellular organisms, consist of rough hierarchies, wherein components at a given level interact more often and more strongly with each other than with components at higher or lower levels in the hierarchy.ii This concept, termed near decomposability by Herbert Simon, but more often called modularity in the biological literature, can be shown to contribute to the evolvability of complex systems. In turn, the prevalence of modularity itself can be explained by evolution.iii Furthermore, an explanation of how modularity can arise in the context of genotype-phenotype mapping leads to the prediction of two other commonly observed properties of biological systems that are not well accounted for by the Darwinian mechanisms of random heritable mutation and natural selection: namely, punctuation and irreversibility.iv As mentioned above, near decomposability (ND) or modularity is a property of systems which contain hierarchies of components, and where the components at one level of hierarchy interact more strongly with each other than with components at other levels. ND does not in any way prohibit interactions across levels of the hierarchy, but asserts that these interactions will be either less frequent or weaker than interactions among components at the same level. This idea of ND is sensitive to time scale. This is shown in the metaphor prosed by Simon of a building with several large rooms, each of which is divided up into cubicles. If some disturbance produces large temperature variation between each of the rooms and each of the cubicles, and between the inside of the building and the outside, the temperature of all the cubicles in a room will fairly rapidly return to equilibrium, relatively unaffected by the temperatures in other room or outside the building. The cubicles are thus analogous to components at a particular level of hierarchy, interacting more strongly with each other than components at other levels. However, at a longer time scale, the rooms of the building will come to an equilibrium temperature despite the thicker walls between them, and this will, of course affect the temperature of the cubicles in those rooms. Eventually, the entire building will come into equilibrium with the outdoor temperature. Nonetheless, in the short run, the effect on the cubicles of other rooms can be ignored. This concept of modularity implies that components at a given level can be studied by scientists without taking into account the minor effects of components at other levels, at least on certain time scales, which is certainly reassuring, given the amount of effort that has been put into reductionist science over the centuries. Simon claims that the ND property of biological systems also has certain implications for evolution. Next, I will discuss several of the specific claims he makes. Simon first proposes that: This assertion relies on the idea that the independent elements, once combined, remain at least mostly independent. However, it seems entirely plausible that in evolving biological systems, the elements, once combined, may form close interdependencies that destroy the original modularity. The question of how modularity arises and how it evolves will be addressed in more detail later, but I will provide one example here of an ambiguous modularity. The theory of endosymbiosis is well known and well supported - it proposes that the origin of the mitochondria and chloroplasts found within eukaryotic cells originated as free living prokaryotes, which formed an endosymbiotic relationship with their host. Presumably, at first, these new residents in the eukaryotic cell were quite independent of the cell they inhabited, but stayed due to some advantages provided - perhaps protection, or access to nutrients. In turn, the ancestor of today's eukaryotes must have been a fairly successful creature, but found that hosting the proto-mitochondria provided an advantage in energy production, and the photosynthetic chloroplast captured the energy of the sun and yielded sugars that the host could burn, store, or convert to structural components. Over evolutionary time, however, both organelles lost most of their genomes to the host nuclear genome and are no longer capable of even semi-autonomous existence. On the other side, even small errors in mitochondrial processes can produce devastating effects of disease in humans and other modern day eukaryotes. It is clear both that these components were once independent, and that they no longer can be described as such in any meaningful sense. Depending on the rate at which independent components become so interdependent as to no longer merit their ND status, the prevalence of ND systems observed may not be as high as Simon suggests. To illustrate the relevance of the ND property to evolution, Simon introduces the parable of two watchmakers.v Hora and Tempus both make fine watches, but their methods of manufacture differ extensively. Hora creates each watch as a combination of ten stable sub-assemblies, each of which, in turn, consists of ten sub-sub-assemblies of ten individual parts each. Thus each watch has a total of 1,000 parts. Tempus's watches also contain 1,000 parts, but there are no sub-assemblies - each watch must be assembled start to finish, and if the process of assembly is interrupted before the final piece is put into place, the entire watch falls apart. This is somewhat like Kauffman's autocatalytic sets - all the pieces must be in place to function at all. Importantly, each of Hora's sub- assemblies and sub-sub-assemblies, once put together, can be safely set aside until it is later incorporated into the next level of the watch-making process. Here's the problem: since each of these manufacturers produces such fine timepieces, their phones ring constantly with new orders, which interrupts the construction. For Hora, this is a minor inconvenience - on average, perhaps 5 pieces of assembly are lost to each new order. But for Tempus, if the interruption comes just as the 990th piece is put into place, the loss is much greater. It is clear that Hora will be able to assemble more watches than will Tempus in a given time with a comparable number of interruptions. Simon concludes from this that watches built as ND structures will be fitter than those built on other architectures and will win out in evolutionary competition. (Simon, 200, p 591) However, in this passage he is discussing the origin of complex systems by evolution, not their subsequent reproductive capacities. It may be correct to then infer that biological systems can arise more quickly by employing ND architectures than otherwise, but this in no way implies that their fitness once they have arisen will be any better than those with other architectures. It is just as easy to imagine that Tempus's watches are better than Hora's as it is to conceive of the reverse. We have said nothing (so far) about the inherent fitness of ND architectures in a particular fitness landscape. I will discuss later work by Wagner and Altenberg that implies modularity is a phenomenon that applies more to the subsequent evolution of biological systems than to their origin. At this point however, I will offer a few examples that might stabilize the non-ND modes of evolution. Just as Tempus might hire an answering service, so biological systems often arrive by chance or by evolution at mechanisms to avoid interruptions of growth and of evolution. For the origin of life, enclosure in a lipid membrane or a small cavity in a rock or some other sheltering space may have provided the time necessary for molecules to interact without being swept away from each other in the currents of the ocean. For the origin of new species, an island often serves as an incubator, away from the pressures of competition on the mainland. And, in the reproductive processes of existing species, gestation often occurs in a protected space, be it the pouch of a daddy seahorse or a bird's egg snug in its nest with mama bird sitting on top ready to bring worms as soon as baby hatches. All of these examples show that mechanisms do exist which protect processes that, like the manufacture of Tempus's watches, must be undertaken from start to finish without interruption. Simon also claims that existing ND systems will evolve faster than ND systems of comparable complexity. Here he uses that parable of a clicking safe. If a safe has 10 dials, each with 100 possible settings, the problem of finding the correct combination of settings on each dial is nearly impossible. If, on the other hand, each dial clicks when the right setting is found, the problem of opening the safe is relatively easy. However, if the correct setting for any one dial depends on the settings of the other nine - that is, if you find a correct setting, but then change one of the other dials, the setting you found is not correct anymore - then it is no easier to open that safe than one that doesn't click at all. The safe that's easy to open is like an ND organism, that can find the best solution for each of its ten modular parts (or genes), without dependence on the states of the other modules. On the other hand, the clicking safe where the correct setting of each dial depends on the settings of all the others, is a completely interdependent architecture. A change in any one of the dials perturbs the other parts of the system and removes them from whatever local optima they had previously attained. Simon states that ND systems are able to improve their fitness quickly, and although they may not attain global maximum fitness, they can out-compete non-ND systems that have excessive interdependence among their parts. This makes sense, given that no evolutionary algorithm guarantees global maxima, and that evolution frequently takes the form of an arms race where one species must constantly evolve new defenses or new attacks to keep up with the changes in its predators or its prey. It is not the globally optima that win these races, but rather satificing strategies that aim for immediate improvement. The truism that possession is nine-tenths of the law also applies here - if a species has occupied a niche with a good enough strategy, it will be more difficult for any other species to come along, even with a more optimally evolved fitness, and oust the already resident species from its niche. So, from the point of virew that ND architecture speeds up evolution, it does seem to be an asset to biological systems possessed of such an architecture. However, there are inherent trade-offs to ND architecture as well. Egidi and Merengovi discuss the sub-optimality of ND architectures in the context of decision making, but their analysis is equally applicable to biological evolution. While decomposition may result in more manageable problems, to which solutions can be more rapidly found by evolution, it also imposes a sort of overhead, whereby the parts must be coordinated in order to produce a coherent whole. This coordination of the parts may take the form of inputs and outputs. In order to not disrupt the whole system, the input and output of any one component must be constrained within a given range. Simon suggests that this can be achieved by a process analogous to top-down computer programming by focusing on the I/O and not micro-managing the detailed internal structure of the modules. In this way, he suggests, efficiencies can be made at the intra- modular level without disturbing the balance of the system. In general, this may be true, however, if the word efficiency is interpreted to mean the rate at which inputs are changed to output, say in metabolism, then changes in the efficiency of a part may increase the rate of output in time, or may increase the output quantitatively if, for example, waste in the internal process is reduced. Therefore, simply restricting the module-level changes to efficiencies may not have the desired result of maintaining stable I/O. Although the concept of modularity is not without its problems, it does seem to exist quite commonly in biological systems. So, we may ask if it is an intrinsic property of life as we know it, or if it is something that evolved later. This question is addressed by Wagner and Altenberg in some detail. It has been observed that taxa with more independently variable traits are found more recently in the fossil record. That is to say, taxa that have more modular characters evolved more recently, so modularity was an evolved property. Furthermore, Wagner and Altenberg distinguish between two modes by which modularity might arise: by parcellation, where characters that were previously highly interdependent become less so, and integration, where characters that were once independent become somewhat independent, thus forming modules. Although integration clearly occurs, as in endosymbiosis, since the fossil reocrd shows more variation as time goes on, rather than less, it seems parcellation is the dominant force. There are several plausible ways in which evolution might promote this process of increasing modularity. First, similar to the clicking safe, when one character is free in constraints placed on it by other characters, it can more easily find optimal states. This can occur when developmental constraints are broken, leaving individual modules free to vary and find better optima than would be possible if every change in one developmental process impacted all other such processes. Second, if a given process depends on fewer others, say it depends on 10 genes rather than 100, then it may take fewer mutations to make improvements, leading to faster response to environmental conditions. Finally, and most convincingly in my opinion, the known process of gene duplication often results in the decay of one copy of the gene to a pseudogene with no effect on the fitness of the organism. The decay into a pseudogene will likely occur if the extra copy has no effect (neutral), or if its effect is deleterious. A gene that is tightly linked with many others is more likely to produce a deleterious effect on at least one of those others. A gene that is tightly controlled by many others is more likely to have no effect at all. Therefore, those genes that are only linked to a few others (say in a module) is most likely to be fixed in the genome, where it can then mutate and acquire new functions. Thus, genomes grow the parts that are modular, whereas the highly interconnected genes may remain more stagnant. It is clear that the evolution of modularity is at least plausible. What types of modules should we expect to see? This question is addressed in part by Stadler, Stadler, Wagner and Fontana in their review of the possible patterns that evolution can produce. Phenotypes are produced by the action of the genotype in a given environment. It is often assumed that any random mutation in the genotype can produce and equivalent change in the phenotype, but in fact, some changes in genotype are silent - producing no change in phenotype, whereas some (likely rare) mutation can produce large jumps in phenotypic space. Thus, certain phenotypes are relatively stable to mutation, but nonetheless, we may expect to sometimes see big changes in a short period of time. Furthermore, some phenotypes may be closer together in mutational space than others, and these distances are not necessarily symmetrical. For example, it may be an easy thing to disrupt a delicate protein structure by a single point mutation, but more difficult to by chance arrive at the single mutation that, from a precursor state - will build that same delicate structure back again. Taken together, these properties of genotype-phenotype mapping predict stable modules, as well as punctuated equilibria and irreversibility in evolution. Although my discussion here has been focused on biological systems, the concept of near decomposability of modularity is certainly applicable more broadly in the study of complex systems. In physics, the hierarchical structures of particles and atoms and molecules exhibit the same sort of interactions that are strong at the same hierarchical level and weaker between levels. In business and economics, similar forces are at work. The name near decomposability hints at the limitation of the concept - the modules in any of these systems are not completely independent, and the complexity of the systems arises in part of the interactions of the modules at different levels. Nonetheless, analysis of complex systems in terms of modules is likely to be a profitable approach as it can simplify some problems and make modeling or experimentation more practical.

BIO.G2.05.1,Application of Microarray Analysis in Drosophila,Biology,Report,"Microarray, also known as DNA array, is to have a collection (at least at a magnitude of thousand) of DNA fragments, whose sequences are known, being arrayed on a solid supporting substance, such as plastic or silicon chip. Usually those probes (i.e. the DNA fragments on microarray) are derived from genes of interest. Therefore, microarray is also called gene chip, or gene array. The basic idea of microarray evolved from Southern blotting. Researchers prepare their sample by labeling DNA molecules in query with substrate which is either fluorescent or radioactive, and then blot the microarray with labeled sample. DNA in query will hybridize to the matching probe on microarray, if there is, otherwise it will be washed away. After hybridization and washing, signals from the label of hybridized DNA will be detected and recorded by reader instruments such as photometer. And data will be compiled and analyzed by software finally. The appearance of microarray allows us to do thousands of southern blotting in parallel. However, that doesn't mean the importance of this technique only limit to speeding up the way we do southern blotting. In fact, the capacity of microarray to test thousands of genes at once make it the most appropriate way to show gene expression profile at certain development stage, compare expression profile between cells in disease and healthy cells, and test the change in the transcription network controlled by certain transcription factor etc. While researcher taking advantages of this technique, they must be careful about its down side. One down side of microarray, which has been improved to some extent, is that mismatching between samples and probes leads to false-positive results. Another thing that researcher should be care of is that how they standardize and statistically analyze the data. Improper data processing will lead to misinterpretation of the data. At last but not least, microarray is still a relatively costly experiment. Proper design of experiment in ahead will avoid waste of money. One year after White, K.P. et al published their work (White K.P. et al. 1999) of analysis of gene expression pattern in Drosophila during metamorphosis by microarray, a group of University of California in San Francisco studied, by microarray, the genome-wide response of aging and oxidative stress in Drosophila melanogaster (Zou, S. et al. 2000). To monitor the change of expression pattern over aging, the authors collected male flies at different ages, and then compare the gene expression pattern of 3-day-old males to others of 10, 25, 30, 40, and 50 days old. Also they fed flies with paraquat, which is a free-radical generator, and compare their expression profile with that of non-fed flies, to test oxidative stress responses. From these experiments they discovered that the transcription level of genes involved in reproduction, metabolism, and protein turnover goes down with aging, while genes of detoxification and chaperones are up-regulation. More surprisingly, they also found that more than 60% of the age-regulated genes showed no response to oxidative stress, and 80% of the oxidative response genes showed no changes over aging, which are interesting and anti-intuition results. An example of how researcher apply microarray in decipher transcription network came from a PNAS paper published by a Swiss group in 2003 (Beltran, S. et al. 2003). By comparing the transcription profile of ash2I1, which is a mutant of transcription factor ash2, with WT by microarray, they attempted to identify putative target genes of ash2. 235 gene were identified, some of which are of great interest to the researches. Microarray is the best way so far to monitor changes in transcription/expression levels. Without the microarray technique, the first paper would be impossible, and the second group would have input much more effect to achieve the same result. In the meanwhile, researches have also expanded the application of microarray into other areas, providing alternative to some conventional approaches. A paper published in 2003 (Sun, L.V. et al. 2003) used microarray to study protein-DNA interaction. The microarray they used is a little bit different from the ones used in first two papers. They were using genomic tiling microarray, which was constructed with genomic DNA fragment covering both coding and non-coding sequences. They set GAF as the query protein and identified 169 putative binding sites. Five of those binding sites as well as seven non-binding sites were verified by ChIP, which is the conventional approach to study protein-DNA interaction (also is possible alternative way for this study). The results showed a good correspondence between the microarray data and ChIP data. The test set in verification seems not large enough to me though. Recently, some other array, such as protein array and tissue array, also evolved, and have been applied into research. High false-positive rate is still a drawback of microarray technique.

BIO.G2.05.2,Assignment: Subcellular Protein Localization,Biology,Report,"Assignment for subcellular protein localization 1. Name of chosen protein: HWP1 Organism: Candida albicans Locus: CAU64206 NCBI Nucleotide accession #: U64206 NCBI protein accession #: AAC96368 2. Predicted function: HWP1 possibly functions as an adhesin in Candida albicans. It has also been demonstrated to play a role in the morphological change (from yeast form to hyphae form) of Candida albicans. 3. The adhesin function of HWP1 implies that it localizes to the cell wall. I did not find any data directly proving this though. In addition, I think it would be interesting to check the change of HWP1 localization during the morphological change of Candida albicans. 4. Results from different protein localization: I.

Comparing the results from two programs, we can see that they gave same/similar results in most aspects. Both programs said that HWP1 doesn't seem to have an N-terminal signal peptide. HWP1 looks more like a peripheral protein rather than an integral one, with single trans-membrane sequence near its C-terminus and its N-terminus facing inside the cell. Nonetheless, those two programs gave controversial results of HWP1 localization. PSORTII suggests that HWP1 localizes to nucleus, while WOLFPSORT predicts HWP1 localizes to extracellular space or cell wall. Given adhesion function of HWP1, the result of WOLFPSORT makes more sense. And it is consistent with the result of TargetP (Because WOLFPSORT has been updated?) However, we can not rule out the possibility that HWP1 may localize to nucleus. 5. HWP1 were overall predicted to be a peripheral membrane protein by all the programs. I further used iPSORT to do an AAindex Analysis, and got Based on this Hydropathy Index of HWP1, I would predict a trans-membrane sequence at its N-terminus. (If I have understood the hydropathy index correctly) I don't know why both PSORTII and WOLFPSORT predict a trans-membrane sequence at the C-terminus of HWP1. 6. Although either PSORTII or WOLFPSORT did not find any N-terminal signal peptide, iPSORT does find a signal peptide in the N-terminus of HWP1. This is consistent with and further consolidates the result of TargetP, which says HWP1 has a signal sequence and is likely a secretory protein. 7. Base on the results of prediction programs, as well as previous data in literature. I would propose that HWP1 has a low expression level in the yeast-form cells of Candida. The expression of HWP1 will be induced during Candida cells change from yeast-form to hyphae-form, and HWP1 will localize to the cell wall. 8. Considering the expression level may affect a protein's subcellular localization, I would take the advantage of homologous recombination in Candida, and replace the endogenous gene of HWP1 with a fusion gene in which HWP1 being tagged with a fluorophore. In this case, the fusion gene will be expressed under endogenous promoter of HWP1, and hopefully has a similar expression level as HWP1. Some better-known adhesion (e.g. ALS3) will be used as cell wall marker. I expected to see dim or no fluorescence from fusion protein in yeast-form cells. After shifting conditions and cells becoming hyphae, I expect to see strong signal and the fluorescence localizes to the cells' surface. If I also tagged ALS3 with another fluorophore, I expect to see co-localization of HWP1 and ALS3. A possible problem is the fluorophore may affect the localization of HWP1. An alternative way to get around is to use HWP1 antibody (which we already have) to do immuno-staining. The down-side of this approach is non-specific binding and staining. Both approaches may require certain amount of HWP1 to exist inside cells. If HWP1 keeps being expressed at a low level, we can make Candida cultures, do cell fractionation. Use HWP1 antibody to detect the amount of HWP1 in each fraction.

BIO.G2.07.1,Biofuels and Biodiversity,Biology,Report,"Biofuels have often been considered renewable, carbon-neutral, green alternatives that could alleviate many of the environmental problems associated with fossil fuels. Increasingly, however, biofuels have been viewed with skepticism by scientists and others for their potential impacts on atmospheric carbon (McLaughlin and Walsh 1998, Hill 2007), world food prices (Runge and Senaur 2007), biodiversity (Hill 2007, Koh 2007), and rural culture (Widenoja 2007). There are many aspects of biofuel agriculture that one could consider, from subsidies and food prices to energy budgets and efficiency. For brevity, this paper will first review the potential impacts of biofuel expansion on biodiversity and habitat. The second part of the paper will give special attention low input, high diversity (LIHD) biofuel systems as a possible alternative to avoid some of the environmental problems caused by conventional biofuel production methods. In his 2007 State of the Union address, President Bush announced his wish to replace 15% of gasoline with renewable fuels by 2017, creating a flurry among politicians and investors to push biofuel research and production (Lewis 2007). While this is perhaps a welcome deviation from the Bush administrations unabated support of fossil fuels, biofuels are not without serious environmental problems. One fundamental concern is that there is simply not enough land area to grow biomass to meet the growing demand for biofuels. By one estimate, about 130 million hectares of biomass production would be needed to supply the United States with transportation fuel, which equivalent to the area of land occupied by all cropland in the late 1980s (Cook et al. 1991). Koh (2007) estimated that if 50% of the worlds cultivated land area were converted to biomass for biodiesel, it would still fall 60% short of the world demand for biodiesel in 2050. Of course, these figures do not predict how or where the displaced food would be produced. Though few are advocating for a complete conversion to biofuels, there is no doubt that the increasing demand for biofuel production will cause serious land use conflicts between food production, biofuel production, and natural ecosystems. There are three main classes of biofuels derived from herbaceous biomass: biodiesel, corn ethanol, and cellulosic ethanol. All types of biofuels share common ecological challenges, but each biofuel class also has unique features that complicate their usefulness and put biodiversity at risk. Biodiesel is largely derived from rapeseed, sunflower seed, oil palm, or soybean. Rapeseed is the source of 84% of the global market in biodiesel, but soybean and oil palm production is rapidly expanding. The United States currently is the largest producer of soybeans in the world, and soybeans account for the majority of the biodiesel production in the U.S. (Ash et al. 2006, EPA 2006). Competition with food crops and an increased interest in corn ethanol production in developed countries has pushed soybean production to the tropics, especially in Brazil and Southeast Asia where land is readily available and labor is cheaper (Koh 2007). Increased biodiesel production in these sensitive tropical areas has devastating consequences for biodiversity. In Brazil and Argentina, 91 million acres of forest and grassland have been converted to soybean production, driven largely by the demand for biodiesel in Brazil (Altieri and Holt-Gimenez 2007). In Indonesia, clearcutting for oil palm plantations has replaced illegal logging and fires as the leading cause of deforestation (Nellman et al. 2007). In Malaysia, 90% of deforestation is attributed to clearing for biofuel production (Lewis 2007), and by 2022, it is estimated that 98% of the tropical rainforest in Indonesia and Malaysia will be gone. If the current rate of deforestation for oil palm plantations continues, the orangutan, not to mention countless less-well-known species, may become extinct as soon as 2012 (Williams 2007). Undoubtedly, corn ethanol has been one of the most-heralded types of biofuels in the developed world, but it has also received much criticism. One major problem with corn ethanol is that it is highly inefficient to produce. Corn ethanol production is in general greatly dependent on nonrenewable fuel inputs, yields only a small or even negative net gain of energy, and can result in a net increase of CO2 emissions (Ulgiati 2001, DeWulf et al. 2005). Clearly, this exacerbates global warming, which is the very problem biofuels are trying to alleviate. The growth of corn ethanol also leads to socio-economic absurdities, such as the likelihood that Iowa will become a net corn importer by 2008 (Runge and Senaur 2007). Beyond inefficiency and social issues, the increased production of corn for ethanol also has a suite of problems related directly to habitat loss. Corn ethanol production is growing rapidly in the United States. The rising demand for corn ethanol has caused an increase in corn prices, from around $2 per bushel in 2005 to up to $4 a bushel in 2007 (Widenoja 2007). This dramatic increase in corn prices, in addition to prompting a cascade of food-affordability problems in Mexico and other areas, has also created less incentive for farmers to participate in the Conservation Reserve Program and other federal conservation measures. Currently, the USDA is accepting no new signups for the CRP, and may allow farmers to terminate their CRP contracts early for the expressed purpose of producing more corn (Ringleman 2007). In Iowa alone, up to 500,000 acres of CRP land, or one-quarter of the total, will likely be farmed in 2008 due to the increased market value of corn (Widenoja 2007). The loss of habitat patches and corridors in heavily farmed regions such as Iowa could pose a serious threat to regional biodiversity. To boost production for ethanol, corn is increasingly being grown without rotation with another crop (often soybean), leading to greater soil erosion and a heightened dependence on chemical fertilizers (Hill 2007). Even without further intensification, corn production is generally more reliant on pesticide and fertilizer inputs and contributes more to soil erosion than other biofuel crops. Runoff from cornfields often contains high levels of sediment, nutrients, and chemical pesticides, all of which have well-known detrimental effects on aquatic biodiversity. Retaining CRP land can mitigate some of the problems associated with polluted runoff, especially when located around streams and waterways (Mulkey et al. 2006). However, since increasing corn prices act as an incentive to cultivate CRP lands, the future of maintaining terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem health in corn-producing areas is doubtful. Cellulosic ethanol is derived from the structural tissue of an array of plant materials including corn stover, sugarcane, woodchips, willow (Salix sp.), and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum). In the United States, perennial grasses, especially switchgrass, have received the most attention and research for their ability to produce high yields quickly and sequester carbon in the soil. From an energetics perspective, cellulosic ethanol from perennial grasses is up to 15 times more efficient to produce than corn ethanol, resulting in a net reduction of atmospheric CO2 (McLaughlin and Walsh 1998). Perennial grasses also cycle and store nitrogen and other nutrients efficiently, reducing the need for inorganic fertilizers (Anex et al. 2007). The extensive root systems of many grasses, including switchgrass, have been utilized in CRP lands to reduce runoff and soil erosion generated from intensive agricultural production, mitigating the damage to aquatic ecosystems (Mulkey et al. 2006). Despite the benefits of switchgrass and other sources of cellulosic ethanol, these systems are subject to the same land use constraints of all other biofuel types. Additionally, fertilizer use can be minimized by using native perennial grasses, but annually removing aboveground biomass from the system necessitates the use of at least some fertilizer (Mulkey et al. 2006). Monocultures of switchgrass or other grasses provide few niches for natural predators that feed on crop pests, so chemical pesticides are often applied. The desire for weed-free stands of grasses also encourages the use of chemical pesticides. Although perennial grasses have been planted on CRP land for erosion control and wildlife habitat, the harvesting of biomass every year, or even twice a year, severely reduces the habitat value to birds, arthropods, and other wildlife (Bies 2006). Patches or strips of grasses could be left unharvested each year, although small patches of monospecific grass may provide only marginal habitat value. Alternately, biomass could be harvested in late fall to avoid some impacts to wildlife, but decomposition and physical matting of the grass may create problems with harvesting. It is also unclear how cutting and removing the biomass will affect nutrient cycling and carbon sequestration (McLaughlin and Walsh 1998, Mulkey et al. 2006). Switchgrass has received most of the attention for cellulosic ethanol production, but other perennial grasses such as big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii) and reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea) are being investigated for their biofuel potential (Hill 2007). These species utilize nutrients efficiently, grow rapidly, and have few pests or diseases, all traits that are trademark characteristics of invasive species (Raghu et al. 2007). Though all native to the United States, switchgrass, big bluestem, and reed canary grass are relatively aggressive species with a high potential for becoming invasive if introduced to new areas. Reed canary grass in particular has caused major setbacks in wet prairie restoration projects across the U.S. (Adams and Galatowitsch 2006), and big bluestem and switchgrass are readily capable of reducing grassland biodiversity without careful management (Wedin and Tilman 1990, Smith et al. 2004). If natural invasive potential is not enough to cause concern, very fast-growing varieties of switchgrass are being bred for ethanol production, essentially increasing its capacity for invasion (Altieri and Holt-Gimenez 2007). The next step in modern agricultural improvement is genetic modification, which could further exacerbate the problem of invasiveness. New fast-growing, highly productive varieties of switchgrass or other biomass crops, whether modified genetically or by artificial selection, may have a competitive advantage over native genotypes. Cellulosic ethanol is perhaps the most environmentally benign form of biofuel agriculture because of its energetic efficiency and the use of native, perennial grasses. Some of the ecological problems associated with cellulosic ethanol production can be alleviated if nonrenewable energy and chemical inputs could be decreased and the species diversity of the system could be increased. The idea that perennial grasses grown in a polyculture can produce energy for human use is not new, as prairie-like agroecosystems have been researched by Wes Jackson and others at the Land Institute for many years (Jackson 2002). However, the idea that biofuel systems could mimic natural ecosystems was formally introduced by ecologist David Tilman and colleagues in 2006. The low-input high-diversity (LIHD) model described by Tilman et al. (2006) offers an agroecological framework that could be useful for reducing biodiversity loss associated with biofuel production. By planting, harvesting, and monitoring grassland plots of varying diversity (1, 2, 4, 8, or 16 species) over a 10 year period, Tilman et al. (2006) showed that the plots with highest diversity produced significantly more usable energy per hectare than less diverse plots, and also produced more energy than corn ethanol or soybean biodiesel. Eighteen species from several functional groups were used in the study, including C4 grasses, C3 grasses, forbs, legumes, and woody species. All species were native to grasslands in the study area, although Poa pratensis is an aggressive cultivar that is frequently undesired in natural prairies. The diverse plots were designed to mimic a native tallgrass prairie, one of the most exploited and fragmented ecosystem types in North America. No fertilizers or pesticides were used to manage the plots, which significantly reduced fossil fuel inputs and completely eliminated negative environmental effects of excess nutrients and chemical toxins. The total energetic input into the system was about 15 times lower than needed for corn ethanol and about 4 times lower than soybean biodiesel, representing a significant decrease in carbon emissions. Additionally, over the 10 years of the study, the most diverse plots (containing 16 species) sequestered 31 times the carbon than did the monocultures, although the authors admitted that difference may narrow in the future as root growth in the diverse systems slows. The combination of low energy input and high carbon storage makes the diverse systems strongly carbon-negative. If LIHD could be adopted on a large scale, it would be much more effective at combating global warming than conventional biofuels. Clearly, this has benefits for biodiversity on a global scale. Moreover, the plots in the study were situated on degraded, abandoned, nutrient-poor agricultural land. If LIHD biofuel production could be successful on exhausted farmland, the pressure to grow biofuels at the expense food crops or natural ecosystems would be reduced. Where ecologically appropriate, LIHD systems could be established in lieu of CRP land, providing both ecosystem services and economic benefits to the farmer. From the perspective from biodiversity, LIHD is a hopeful proposal because it addresses the problem of biofuels on at least two levels. First, LIHD systems would directly increase the diversity in abandoned or marginal agricultural land by recreating a historically important plant community, which in turn would attract an array of associated biodiversity. Considering that less than 1% of the original tallgrass prairie is left intact in North America (Samson and Knopf 1994), there is a clear need for restoration and expansion of remaining areas. Secondly, LIHD would increase the quality of the agricultural matrix, that is, it would facilitate migration between existing habitat fragments, thereby lowering the risk of extinction (Vandermeer and Perfecto 2006). Even if LIHD systems fall short of completely reflecting the diversity and function of native tallgrass prairies, they could be quite valuable for reducing extinction in the historical tallgrass prairie region and in surrounding areas with mixed forest, savanna, and prairie. The LIHD concept described by Tilman et al. (2006) is a significant ideological advance which may resolve some of the problems of biodiversity loss and habitat destruction associated with conventional biofuels. Despite these benefits, the LIDH model has several problems that threaten its usefulness as a viable alternative to conventional biofuel systems.1 First, LIHD prairies are likely to thrive best in areas where tallgrass prairies existed historically, that is, in central North America where mollisols are the dominant soil type. Mollisols also occur in large regions of Eurasia and in Patagonia in South America (USDA Global Soil Regions Map, 2005), and those also may be appropriate areas for LIHD biofuel production. In North America and central Eurasia, however, most of those soils have been dominated by conventional corn, wheat, or barley production. There is simply not enough abandoned agricultural land in these areas to support widespread LIHD. By a generous estimate, even if all the abandoned agricultural land in the world were converted to LIHD production, it would produce only enough energy to replace 13% of global petroleum consumption (Tilman et al. 2006), and realistic estimates may be much lower (Russelle et al. 2007). Thus, if LIHD systems were to be widely adopted in the future as the most economically- and ecologically-sound alternative energy source, it would still result in significant displacement of food crops and natural ecosystems. It is also unclear if the results of the study, which took place in Minnesota, could be extrapolated to other parts of the world (Russelle et al. 2007). If increasing native biodiversity is a goal of LIHD, at the very least, new systems composed of locally native species would have to be developed for each region of the world. In forested areas that are threatened by conventional biofuel expansion, woody LIHD systems (i.e., agroforests) would have to be developed, because grasslands would not meaningfully address biodiversity loss either from a habitat fragment or matrix perspective. Developing new systems for different regions could be a major challenge to the widespread adoption of LIHD, requiring knowledge and expertise of local ecosystems and a great deal of research. This would be difficult to carry out in part because it directly contrasts the predominant industrial model of uniformity, efficiency, and commodification of the modern agricultural process. One of the advantages of LIHD systems is that they can be established on severely degraded land with low nutrient content. While it is true that tallgrass prairies can be established and restored on marginal land, the challenges of doing so may prohibit LIHD systems from being successful. Common problems of prairie re-creation and restoration may be further complicated by managing LIHD systems for biofuel production. For example, degraded fields can be so dominated by persistent invasive species such as spotted knapweed (Centuarea maculosa), Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis), and orchard grass (Dactylis glomerata) that increasing native diversity is nearly impossible (Blumenthal et al. 2003, Biondini 2007). Many sub-dominant prairie species, important for overall diversity, have conservative establishment characteristics that limit their ability to compete with invasives (Kleijn 2003). To reduce the dominance of invasives, harvest of the biomass should occur in early or mid summer, before many invasives go to seed. However, the greatest biomass, and thus the most energy, is available after the summer growing season. Furthermore, prairie re-establishment projects are often reliant on native propagules that have survived in the seedbank (Glass 1989), but in previously farmed areas, the seedbank may be destroyed by decades of tilling. Prairies created from seed can take several years for the plant community to stabilize, and the diversity after that time is often less than what was present in the original seed mix (Piper and Pimm 2002). Also, it may be unreasonable to expect farmers to establish LIHD systems and then wait several years before they reap any economic benefit. Finally, the supply of genotypically native seeds of the common warm-season grasses (such as Andropogon gerardii, Schizachyrium scoparium and Sorghastrum nutans), and especially rarer species, is small and unpredictable, and seeds are time-consuming to collect and process (Apfelbaum et al. 1997). There simply may not be enough seed available to plant LIHD systems on a large scale. Once established, native prairies must be carefully managed to maintain diversity, but new challenges arise if the biomass is removed annually, as in the case of biofuel systems. For example, diversity decreases in most cases when aboveground biomass is removed by annual burning (Gibson et al. 1993). Whereas some nutrients remain for uptake after a fire, annual harvesting leaves few above-ground nutrients available for next years growth, complicating nutrient cycles and leaving the sustainability of annually-harvested LIHD systems in question (Van Dyke et al. 2004, Mulkey et al. 2006, Russelle 2007). Since the ecology of prairie re-creation and restoration is complex, farmers can not be expected to take up this task without extensive training, a task which extension services and other agricultural assistance programs are not equipped to do. The LIHD concept faces similar problems of cellulosic ethanol when it comes to the invasive potential of some of the species used. Although LIHD is an ecological approach to biofuel production, seed companies would surely try to sell farmers new, fast-growing, high-yielding varieties of certain species. This would likely entail moving more of a plants biomass from the root system to the above-ground portions, limiting carbon sequestration and changing nutrient cycles in the soil. Worse, using improved varieties could limit genetic diversity in the LIHD field and in surrounding populations of genotypically native species. For nearly every major agricultural system in the developed world, the alteration and distribution of seeds has become controlled by a few large corporations such as Syngenta and Monsanto, which have close financial relationships with other members of the agro-petro-industrial complex. While these corporations are not necessarily anti-environmental, they are profit-seeking businesses with a poor history of encouraging sustainable agriculture and biodiversity conservation. Their involvement with LIHD could undermine some of the ecological benefits of diverse biofuel systems. Also of concern is that the technology for converting multi-species cellulosic biomass into fuel is in its infancy (Houghton et al. 2006). Assuming an efficient way to process multi-species biomass is discovered in the future, it is likely that processing plants would only be able to convert one kind of LIHD makeup at a time. That is, plants may not have the technological flexibility to process multi-species biomass of different species composition and relative abundance. The lack of uniformity in LIHD systems could be a major problem, even with plant material produced within a single field. For example, soil patches with high nitrogen may yield few legumes, while areas with slightly less nitrogen may have a greater abundance of legumes (Piper 1994). These affects would be amplified as the spatial scale increases. Temporal variations in species composition caused by changes in yearly weather patterns, invasion, and other unplanned disturbances could also compound efforts to produce ethanol from multi-species biomass. Even if the micro-scale and temporal problems were resolved in the future, either one type of LIHD system would be cultivated across a large region regardless of the native biota, or a series of small, local processing plants would need to be set up to accommodate different species mixes appropriate for each location. Given the current agro-industrial economic system and the scale at which biofuels are needed to be grown to meet fuel demands, the latter situation is unlikely. This leads to the conclusion that LIHD systems are subject to a paradox of scale. On one hand, LIHD systems require expertise and local knowledge to successfully establish and manage, and because of this, like other high-diversity agroecosystems, LIHD would work better at a small scale. However, in order for LIHD or any biofuel system to meaningfully alleviate our dependence on fossil fuels, a vast amount of land must be converted. In todays agro-industrial economy, it is much easier to establish large, monospecific fields maintained with pesticides and fertilizers than it is to carefully manage a high diversity tallgrass prairie. The paradox is this: LIHD, almost by definition, can not work on a large scale, but biofuels, due to their high demand, must. It is clear that conventional biofuel systems often complicate the problems they intend to solve, and pose a significant threat to global biodiversity. Biodiesel production is a major contributor to unprecedented rates of deforestation in large parts of the tropics. Corn ethanol, with its heavy dependence on fossil fuel inputs and high rates of soil erosion and polluted runoff, is perhaps the most wasteful and ineffective alternative energy source in use today. Switchgrass and other cellulosic ethanol sources are more environmentally sound, but still rely on pesticide and fertilizer inputs and are subject to the same land use conflicts as other biofuels. With the demand for renewable fuels increasing, a different approach must be taken. The low-input high-diversity concept presented by Tilman and others is a pioneering step in the right direction, but ultimately falls short of a workable solution. Clearly LIHD is not a dead-end proposition, and more research must be done to determine the ecological, technical, economic, and political feasibility of LIHD biofuel systems. Energy could be diverted from research on biofuel systems that will almost certainly be unsustainable over the long term, such as corn ethanol. One important area of research is to apply the LIHD concept to tallgrass prairies with different species compositions, and even to completely different ecosystem types such as forests. It would also be beneficial to make processing plants flexible as to what species mix and proportions they can use to make ethanol. Perhaps paramount is the need for research to increase the efficiency of the conversion process in order to get the most energy out per unit of biomass. Increasing efficiency would reduce the amount of land needed to produce biofuels, resulting in less competition with food crops and less ecosystem destruction. Even if efficiency increases, it is hard to imagine that there will ever be enough productive land available to heavily rely on biofuels, LIHD or otherwise. Biofuels must be combined with robust, truly renewable energy sources that are not agriculturally based to lessen the impact on global biodiversity.

BIO.G0.02.6,Genetic Analysis of Drosophila Melanogaster Mutants: To Determine Inheritance and Linkage Patterns,Biology,Research Paper,"Ore-R wild-type (+type) Drosophila melanogaster, the common fruit fly, phenotypically displays red-eyes, full wing venation (five longitudinal veins and two cross veins), and a tan body color. The true breeding culture U-5343, however, varies from this wild type with white eyes, terminating pre-margin longitudinal veins LII and LIV, and a black body color. Experimentation was undertaken to investigate these mutations. Through crossing with the Ore-R type, and three marker cultures of Drosophila (Marker I, Marker II and Marker III cultures) the genetic differences between the +type and U-5343 were determined to be the following: black-body color is controlled by one autosomal recessive gene (expressed symbolically as bb), located on autosome three, with the exact locus undeterminable; mutant wing venation is also a single autosomal recessive gene (tv) on autosome two, located at 3.8 mu; the white eye color is controlled by two autosomal recessive genes (a and b), both located on autosome two and interacting epistatically to generate three mutant eye colors: white (aabb), orange (a+_bb) and brown (aab+_). Gene a is located at 84.8 mu and gene b is located at 45.8 mu. This data was gathered via five initial crosses, followed by three F1 crosses and two male backcrosses. The specifics of these crosses are outlined below, but they will be distinguished as the follow: Cross A, Cross B, Cross I, Cross II, Cross III, F1xF1 of Cross A, F1xF1 of Cross B, F1xF1 of Cross I, Male Backcross II, and Male Backcross III. The genetic map of autosome two, including marker genes (Bl: bristle, L: Lobed, and Cy: Curly) was determined and is as follows: Drosophila melanogaster, or the common fruit-fly, offers the geneticist a near perfect organism to explore the models of inheritance via simple, straight forward, cross breeding experiments. Short living - with a fast generation time - easy to handle and maintain in cultures and female only cross-over events, make D. melanogaster most desirable in the lab. As result much is known about the fruit flies genome; however, on occasion new mutations are discovered and experimentation is undertaken to determine the exact genes involved in these new mutants. A true breeding culture of Drosophila, dubbed U-5343, is an example of such a scenario. The flies exhibit three genetically controlled novel phenotypic traits: black bodies, terminating pre-margin longitudinal veins LII and LIV, and white eyes. Ascertaining the nature of these mutations is an interesting problem and useful to the study of genetics in general. To answer questions, such as: what are modes of inheritance (dominant/recessive/sex-linked/autosomal); how many genes are involved; and, where are the genes located - cross breeding experimentation was undertaken. Specifically, five initial crosses and five secondary crosses were preformed in hopes of answering these questions. Two of these initial crosses were reciprocal crosses. Cross A (unknown virgin female x +type male) and Cross B (+type virgin female x unknown male) were done to determine if the genes are recessive or dominate and sex-linked or autosomal. The secondary crosses, F1xF1 of Cross A and F1xF1 of Cross B, were done to determine: the number of genes controlling the trait; these genes interaction, if multiple present; the segregation ratios for each gene; independent assortment between genes, by a �2 test; and, the map distances between linked genes. Answering these questions was accomplished by scoring flies of both F1 and F2 generations of the two crosses. Cross I (unknown virgin females x M-I males) and F1xF1 of Cross I were done to determine the relationship between the genes and the X-chromosome. The specifics of the marker type can be found in the MATERIALS AND METHODS section, however, these crosses were potentially helpful to determine if the genes are on the X-chromosome and, if yes, where they are located. Again, scoring F1 and F2 flies could be used to determine the loci of the genes on X-chromosome - it was important here to record gender in this scoring. However, if no genes are found on the X-chromosome (based on the results of Crosses A and B), then simply scoring F2 flies would be helpful to later determine the map distance between linked genes not on the X-chromosome. This is possible because if the genes are not sex-linked, then ignoring the secondary marker characteristics of the F2 would make them functionally the same as the F2's of cross A and B - since then they become equivalent to the wild-type flies. Finally, the Crosses II and III were done to determine where the genes were located in regards to the second and third autosome, with autosomal specific traits. Specifics of these marker types and their phenotypic expression can be found in the MATERIALS AND METHODS. In brief, however, these initial crosses, when scored would help show only if the mutant genes were dominant or recessive. A secondary backcross of the male progeny of these crosses with unknown virgin females was necessary to determine which chromosome the genes were on. Notably absent for all the crosses described here is an emphasis on autosome IV; since this autosome is so small it is not likely that these mutations' loci are there. The crosses and scoring were done over a series of seven weeks and all flies for all crosses were grown at 24� C. All flies were anesthetized using CO2 and inspected under a dissecting or stereoscopic microscope while on CO2 pads. The average time sedated was minimized to prevent sterility. Flies were handled with small brushes and prodding needles; for specifics on fly handling please see Jeyabalan (2005). In total five different cultures of flies were used: Oregon-R (Ore-R) type wilds, unknown culture U-5343, and marker stocks labeled M-I, M-II, M-III. Two Ore-R stocks and eight mutant stocks were initially provided. Two new cultures of U-5343 were made during the experiment to maintain the stock for later backcrosses. There was continuous access to all marker stocks. Wild-type flies were phenotypically described as: tan bodied, red eyed, full wing venation with straight wings, and normal straight bristles. U-5343 flies were observed to be black bodied with white eyes and lacked a complete LII and LIV longitudinal veins (failing to reach margin); they were wild-type for all marker genes. M-I flies were wild-type expect for the following traits: crossvienless (cv - X-chromosome @ 13.7) and forked, shortened bristles (f - X-chromosome @ 56.7). M-II flies were wild-type expect for the following traits: short-thin bristles (Bl - autosome II @ 54.8), small 'lobed' eyes (L - autosome II @ 72.0), and with curled wings (Cy - autosome II @ 6.1). M-II was a balanced-lethal culture so all flies showed a Bl L/Cy genotype. M-III flies were wild-type expect for the following traits: small 'smooth' eyes (Gl - autosome III @ 41.4) and short blunt bristles (Sb - autosome III @ 58.2) with the inversion known as LVM present (autosome III lethal balancing inversion), a non-phenotypically expressed trait. Again, M-III was a balanced-lethal culture so all flies showed a Gl Sb/LVM genotype. All cultures were true breeding. For more details about mark stocks and traits see Jeyabalan (2005) Concerning the crosses in general, when virgin females were needed all flies were removed from source bottle and, then, 6-8 hours later virgin females were harvested. For all crosses parent flies were removed from bottles 8-10 days after the cross and all flies were scored 14-20 days after the cross. All crosses were done in duplicate unless otherwise indicated. When scoring, body color, eye color, wing venation, sex, and relevant marker traits were all recorded. See appendix (skeletal report) for scoring data table structure. Cross A: unknown virgin females were crossed with wild-type males, F1 flies were scored. From the F1 generation, flies were collected and placed into a new bottle for the F1xF1 of Cross A. F2 flies were scored. Cross B: unknown virgin females were crossed with wild-type males, F1 flies were scored. From the F1 generation, flies were collected and placed into a new bottle for the F1xF1 of Cross B. F2 flies were scored. Marker Cross I: unknown virgin females were crossed with M-I males, F1 flies were scored. From the F1 generation, flies were collected and placed into a new bottle for the F1xF1 of Cross I. F2 flies were scored. Marker Cross II: unknown virgin females were crossed with M-II type males, F1 flies were scored. From the F1 generation, Bl L/Cy+ male flies were collected and crossed with unknown virgin females - a male backcross. Cross was not done in duplicate. Additionally, Bl+ L+/Cy male flies were collected and crossed with unknown virgin females - not done in duplicate. The first cross yielded offspring which were scored. The second cross yielded no offspring, so no flies were scored. Marker Cross III: unknown virgin females were crossed with M-III type males, F1 flies were scored. From the F1 generation, Gl Sb/LVM+ male flies were collected and crossed with unknown virgin females - a male backcross. The male backcross progeny were scored. After all the data was collected, the unneeded flies were euthanized and discarded in a humane fashion. In general, all but one of the crosses went as expected and there were no major problems with determining the nature of the genes involved in the U-5343 mutant culture. In the analysis below, to find any �2 calculations please see appendix (calculations); also, please see appendix (skeletal report) for raw data tables. Crosses A and B: Table 1: Cross A, F1 Table 2: Cross B, F1 These two tables are very revealing: first, since these crosses were reciprocal and there is no significant differences between male and female expressed phenotype, it is most likely that all mutations are autosomal in nature. Secondly, since no mutant types are present in any flies, it should be that the mutations are all recessive. These conclusions can only be drawn, however, because it was given that the unknowns were true-breeding homozygous mutants. Further analysis of the F2 generation helps confirm these initial observations. Qualitatively, in the F2 generation, mutant wing venation and normal wing venation were both observed. Additionally, mutant body color and wild-type body color were observed. However, four eye colors were observed: red, white, orange and brown - suggesting that more then one mutant gene is affecting eye color. The organized data of the F2 crosses are presented in Tables 3-6. These tables combine both Cross A with B, and ignores gender; there should be no differences in the F2 sexes where the genes are autosomal recessive. These tables were compiled from the raw data tables present in the appendix. Table 3 establishes the segregation pattern of the body color gene. The �2 here is .606 (0.455 < �2 < 2.706 for 1 df), thus 0.1 < p < .5. This confirms proper segregation of the blackbody mutant color - supporting the null hypothesis. The gene, then, for the black body color is bb. Table 4 verifies the segregation pattern of the wing venation mutation gene. The �2 here is 1.87 (again, 0.455 < �2 < 2.706 for 1 df), thus 0.1 < p < .5. This suggest proper segregation of the wing venation mutation - again, supporting the null hypothesis. The gene, then, for the mutant wing venation is tv. Table 5 helps determine the relationship between these two genes, tv and bb. Assuming a null of independent assortment, a �2 test reveals a value of 3.45 (2.366 < �2 < 6.251 for 3 df), yielding 0.1 < p < 0.5. Thus, one cannot reject the null hypothesis of independent assortment, signifying that no linkage exists between these two genes and they are on different autosomes. Finally, Table 6 explores the assortment of the two eye color genes. Qualitative observation suggests that two genes - a and b - interact epistatically to control eye color, thereby, producing four observed eye color possibilities: white (aabb), orange (a+_bb), brown (aab+_), and wild-type red (a+_b+_). To test for assortment, the �2 for the eye color genes based on cross A and B combined was calculated at 87.59, giving a p < .005 for 3 df of freedom. This a significant deviation from the expected results, implying that the two genes are indeed linked. Furthermore, here the orange and brown types represent a recombination event, allowing for the calculation1 of a mapping distance between the two genes at 37.4 mu. Observations of the male parent backcross help to reveal the autosome associated with the mutant genes. As aforementioned, the two marker crosses represent a balanced lethal system, where heterozygosity is maintained, even in the face of crossing over. With such marker systems, one can easily determine the autosome upon which an unknown mutation lies. Backcrossing the males (hybrid M-II, or M-III, and unknown flies) with the unknown female culture produces male backcross progeny. If the recessive mutation(s) is linked to the markers, then it will not show-up with the marker phenotype in the male back cross progeny - since crossing over does not occur in the male Drosophila. Alternatively, if the recessive mutation(s) does show up with the marker type, then it must be independently assorting and, therefore, on a different autosome than the marker. For the male backcross progeny observed here, compelling results allow for autosomal assignment of all mutant genes. M-II backcross progeny were observed phenotypically as bristle, lobed, and black bodied - showing that the body color is not on the second autosome, but on the third. Also, neither the wing mutation nor the eye color mutation were present with the markers in the M-II backcross progeny, implying their presence on the second autosome. However, the curly-type backcross did not produce any viable offspring; most likely because balanced lethal systems often create very fragile males, easily sterilized by overexposure to CO2. Nevertheless, the M-III backcross showed glued, stubbled, white-eyed, wing mutant flies, confirming the presence of these three mutant genes (a, b, and tv) on the second autosome and supporting the results of the successful M-II backcross. Additionally, the mutant body color did not show up with the marker phenotypes, also corroborating the assignment of this gene to the third autosome. In summary then, the mutant genes a, b, and tv are on the second autosome and the mutant gene bb is on the third autosome. Thus, using a three point cross and the combined data of the F2 progeny from crosses A, B, and M-I, one can complete2 the map of autosome two, by determining the mutant positions. However, from these experiments, the map of autosome three cannot be completed; though, a female parent back cross of M-III would allow for the missing mapping data to be scored. As all other crosses have indicated, no unknown mutations are present on the X-chromosome. This, however, does not mean that the M-I cross was done in vain - by ignoring the marker phenotypes, the M-I cross effectively becomes the same as the A/B crosses. Thus, by combining all of these crosses (table 7), a robust data set is created where a three point cross can determine the map distances between a, b, and tv. From the table then: a-b = (46+65+50+27)*2/975 = .386 or 38.6 mu (note: this is very close to the previous estimate of 37.4 from Cross A/B alone) a-tv = (46+65+46+88+50+27+46+27)*2/975 = .810 or 81.1 mu b-tv = (46+88+46+27)*2/975 = .420 or 42.0 mu From these map points, we see that the proper gene order is tv-b-a and we can now map the autosome. The mutation tv is was given at 3.8 mu. Therefore, b is 3.8+42.0 = 45.8 mu and a is 3.8+81 = 84.8. The map, with all marker genes included, is represented by image 1: Through well thought-out cross breeding experiments, the previously unknown genetic components of a true breeding Drosophila m. culture (U-5342) was determined. In all, four new genes were discovered and described, in brief, that control body color, wing venation, and eye color. The gene bb (black body) is autosomal recessive and located on the third autosome; further tests are needed to establish the exact location. The genes a and b epistatically controlling eye-color, they are linkage with a distance of about 38.6 mu. They express themselves in four ways phenotypically, red (a+_bb), orange (a+_bb), brown (aab+_) and white (aabb). And are mapped at the locations in the figure above. Finally, the gene tv (pre-terminating LII and LIV longitudinal veins) is autosomal recessive and on the second chromosome, also mapped above with a and b. Calculations: Body Color Segregation: �2 = (574-564.75)2 / 564.75 + (179-188.25)2 / 188.25 = .606 Wing Venation Segregation: �2 = (581-564.75)2 / 564.75 + (172-188.25)2 / 188.25 = 1.39 Independent Assortment of tv and bb: �2 = (439-421.31)2 / 421.31+ (142-140.45)2 / 140.45 + (131-140.45)2 / 140.45 + (37-46.81)2 / 46.81 = 3.45 Independent Assortment of a and b: �2 = (527-432)2 / 432+ (86-144)2 / 144+(73-144)2 / 144+(68-48)2 / 48 = 87.59 ! 2 * (73 + 67)/754 = 282/754 = .374 or 37.4 mu ; Given that tv is at 3.8 mu The Michigan Corpus of Upper-level Student Papers (MICUSP) is owned by the Regents of the University of Michigan (UM), who hold the copyright.

BIO.G0.03.1,Lab 3: Plant Competition,Biology,Research Paper,"The ability of a species to compete for limited resources is often central to its ability to survive in a given environment. Different species possess differential competitive abilities, which are often dependent upon environmental conditions. For all organisms, the effects of competition become more pronounced with an increase in density because more organisms are searching for resources in the same areas, depleting the resources to continually lower levels. One way that plants gain a competitive edge is by forming mutualistic relationships with other organisms, thereby working together to promote mutual survival. Rhizobium bacteria have a symbiotic relationship with the roots of legumes in which they fix atmospheric nitrogen and provide it to the plant in exchange for resources such as carbon (Begon, et al., 2003). In this experiment we examined how the presence of Rhizobium affected the competitive ability of red clover (Trifolium pretense) which is a legume, when grown with red fescue (Festuca rubra) which is not leguminous. We hypothesized that Rhizobium form a mutualistic relationship with legumes and provide it with nitrogen, and from this we predicted that red clover would compete better against red fescue (a grass) in environments with Rhizobium present. Our results did not indicate a difference in competitive ability of red fescue in the presence or absence of Rhizobium. This is illustrated by the fact that the confidence intervals in the linear regression graphs are broadly overlapping (Figure 1). The R squared values for the Rhizobium and no Rhizobium treatments of .810 and .778 respectively indicate that the best fit lines in the graph are accurate representations of our data. The p-values of .038 and .048 for the R square data indicate that it is statistically significant, which means there is a significant relationship between target weight and neighbor density and hence that competition is occurring. Our results did not support our prediction that red clover would compete better in the presence of Rhizobium. One explanation for this is the possibility that we made some incorrect assumptions as part of our experimental model. One important assumption we made was that nitrogen was a limiting resource which both plant species were competing for, which in reality may or may not have been the case. The nitrogen concentration may have been high enough in the soil that the additional nitrogen provided by the Rhizobium did not provide any appreciable advantage to the red clover. If this were the case, then the Rhizobium may have actually hurt the clover's competitive ability by taking its resources without providing necessary nutrients in exchange. If we were able to do the experiment again, it would be helpful to test the nitrogen content of the soil to ensure that it is in fact a limiting resource. Another important assumption we made was that red clover and red fescue shared the same traits apart from clover being a legume and fescue a grass. However, there is one other difference in that red clover is a dicot while red fescue is a monocot. Physiological differences, particularly in the root system, suggest that dicots are better at absorbing nutrients from the soil than monocots. Although this would imply that clover is still a better competitor, it is possible that there are other confounding factors which gave the fescue a similar competitive effect in the presence and absence of Rhizobium. A more practical aspect of our experimental design that could be problematic is that we looked at the biomass of the part of the plant above the ground only, by clipping it at ground level and then weighing it. If the effects of competition led one plant species or the other to divert more resources to the roots and away from stems and leaves, our data could be misleading. One other potential problem exists with our model in that it does not account for the proximity of plants to each other. While it is a logical assumption that with increasing density, proximity of plants increases, it is possible that in low density plots, seeds of competitors by chance happened to fall very close to the target seeds. The closer the plants are physically, the more their resource utilization areas overlap, and the stronger the effects of competition between them. Aside from the aforementioned problems with the assumptions of our model, the additive design of our experiment seems to be the best way to examine competition between species. An additional experiment we could have performed is a replacement series in which the proportion of the two species is varied while keeping the total plant density the same. The problem with this approach is that it is impossible to distinguish between intra- and interspecific competition (Park et al., 2003). Since for this experiment we are looking specifically at the interspecific competitive effects, the additive design is the better approach. Examining the competitive effects and responses of various plant species to interactions with other species has particular relevance to ecologists or conservation biologists trying to manipulate species composition. Over the long term, it would seem that competitive response is more important to a plant's ability to persist at a site. Unless the plant is the top competitor in an ecosystem, it is likely that with time other species which are good competitors will begin to grow at the same site and deplete the resource base to low levels. In order to persist, the plant will have to be tolerant of low resource levels; otherwise it will be outcompeted by plant species which are better able to absorb resources from the environment. Although some plants that have a strong competitive effect also have a strong competitive response, the two do not necessarily go together. It is possible that a plant which has a strong competitive effect is good at hoarding resources at a particular site and simply survives by preventing other species from establishing there. This experimental model also has relevance to the Lotka-Volterra model for competition. In order to test whether stable coexistence can occur (the effects of intraspecific competition are greater than interspecific), we would have to do an additional experiment in which the target and neighbor species were switched, because the current set-up only determines the effect of fescue on clover and not vice-versa. With data from both density experiments there are equations which make it possible to sort out the effects of intra- vs. interspecific competition (Park et al., 2003). Establishing the effects of plant species interactions has a lot of implications for farming (weed-crop competition), plant conservation and the management of invasive species. By understanding how different environmental conditions affect these interactions, ecologists will be better able to use this knowledge to their advantage in creating environments which allow for a particular target species to have the greatest competitive advantage. Figure 1: This graph plots the natural log of the weight of the legume (red clover) against the density of the competing plants (red fescue).

BIO.G0.03.2,The Effects of Motor Oil on Aquatic Insect Predation,Biology,Research Paper,"Abstract: Modern technology and urbanization have brought about some important consequences for freshwater ecosystems. Urban run-off has carried a number of new pollutants, including motor oil and other petroleum products, into urban and suburban ponds, streams and rivers. To date, not much investigation has been carried out in regards to the effects of this oil pollution on freshwater organisms. In this experiment I investigated the effects of different concentrations of motor oil on dragonfly nymph activity and dragonfly consumption of damselfly nymphs in laboratory microcosms. The activity level and predation rate was monitored in four different concentrations of motor oil (.1%, .5%, 1%, 2%) as well as in a control. Results indicated a significant relationship between predation rate and oil concentration, but no correlation was found between dragonfly activity level and oil concentration. These results have implications for maintenance of aquatic species diversity as well as trophic interactions beyond the aquatic system, as both dragonfly and damselfly nymphs are important predator and prey items in aquatic food webs. Pollution of aquatic environments by petroleum products is an issue of concern to many ecologists and environmentalists. While it receives a lot of attention after major commercial oil spills, this is not in fact the primary source of oil pollution. According to a report by the National Academies' National Research council, 29 million gallons of petroleum products enter North American waters annually from anthropogenic sources, 85% of which is from land runoff, oil-contaminated rivers, airplanes and small watercraft. All this is in addition to the 47 million gallons that naturally seep into waters through the ocean floor (Coleman, et al., 2003). Petroleum products can have several negative consequences for aquatic ecosystems. The major constituents of petroleum products are complex hydrocarbons, comprising 80-90% of unused motor oil (Irwin, et al., 1997). Of all these hydrocarbon groups, polycylic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are thought have the most toxic effects, as they attach easily to sediment surfaces and are relatively resistant to degradation (Vo, et al., 2004). Oil slicks formed at the surface can potentially limit oxygen exchange at the water-air boundary, decreasing the levels of dissolved oxygen in the water. Oil at the surface also has the potential to coat the gills of aquatic organisms, adversely affecting respiration (Bhattacharyya, et al., 2003). Not many studies have been done to investigate the effects of oil pollution on freshwater systems, as most large-scale oil spills occur in marine environments. However, studies on the effects of the more general category of freshwater pollutants, which include oils/grease, but also heavy metals and other toxic pollutants, have been done. In fact, aquatic insects are often used as an indicator of water quality, a concept known as biomonitoring. Benthic invertebrates are the most frequently used organisms in biomonitoring, as they are a diverse group of organisms which exhibit varying degrees of tolerance to environmental conditions (Merritt and Cummings, 1996). Insects of the order Odonata, which includes damselflies and dragonflies, are known to be moderately sensitive to environmental pollutants, and their absence from a particular habitat is frequently indicative of poor water quality. In an experiment investigating the effects of urban runoff on stream water quality, benthic organisms were surveyed upstream and downstream of an urban development. The prevalence of dragonflies was found to be significantly higher at upstream sites (22%) than at downstream sites (4%). It was concluded that this was a result of pollution and eutrophication decreasing the levels of dissolved oxygen in the stream sites downstream of the development (DeBarruel and West, 2003). Odonates are particularly sensitive to dissolved oxygen levels. According to Merritt and Cummings (1996) a major challenge for any aquatic insect is to obtain sufficient quantities of oxygen for its metabolic needs (36). For dragonflies and damselflies this is particularly true due to their closed tracheal systems; rather than obtaining oxygen through direct contact with air, their tracheal gills uptake oxygen dissolved in the water (Merritt and Cummings, 1996). Therefore any circumstance which decreases dissolved oxygen levels has negative repercussions for dragonfly and damselfly respiration. For this experiment, I set up a laboratory system to investigate the effects of different concentrations of motor oil on dragonfly nymphs and their predatory interactions with damselfly nymphs. The dependence of dragonflies and damselflies on relatively high levels of dissolved oxygen, and oil's effects on dissolved oxygen concentration led me to hypothesize that adding motor oil to simulated pond environments would affect activity levels in dragonflies. I predicted that an increase in concentration of motor oil would lead to lower activity levels in dragonflies. The activity levels of both dragonflies and damselflies have implications for predation. Both dragonflies and damselflies are predatory insects, but presumably due to size advantage, dragonflies prey on damselflies and not vice-versa. Dragonflies are generally ambush predators, waiting for prey to approach before attacking, but will occasionally switch to a more active foraging strategy if food availability is low (Gullan and Cranston, 2005). They rely primarily on tactile cues in searching for prey but also take advantage of visual cues (Resh and Rosenberg, 1984). As a corollary to my first hypothesis, I hypothesized that the addition of oil to the environments would have an effect on predation rates. A decrease in activity of damselflies (prey) would result in fewer visual cues for dragonflies and a decrease in activity level of dragonflies would lead to less active foraging behavior. Therefore, I predicted a negative correlation between oil concentration and number of prey eaten. I set up five clear plastic containers and filled each with 2 liters of pond water in an attempt to most effectively simulate a natural freshwater habitat. The first container was a control with no oil added, and the four successive containers were contaminated with increasing concentrations of unused motor oil (.1%, .5%, 1% and 2%). I collected dragonfly and damselfly nymphs from Willow Pond at Matthaei Botanical Gardens, and added one dragonfly predator to each container along with multiple damselfly prey. I performed two replicates of the experiment; two damselflies were placed with each dragonfly in the first replicate and six damselflies in the second. [Note: I misidentified several of the prey items I added to the containers in the 2nd replicate, meaning that some containers contained a mixture of mayflies and damselflies. However, I don't believe this should have an effect on the experiment as both are preyed upon by dragonfly nymphs]. After placing the insects in the containers, I collected data on their activity level by tracking their movement at ten minute intervals. Every ten minutes I marked the approximate location of the dragonfly and then noted whether it moved from that spot in the following time interval. I collected activity data a second time after the insects had been exposed to the oil for five days. During each collection I recorded data for five time intervals. In order to determine the predation rate, I counted the number of surviving damselflies after five days and then determined the number of prey eaten. I divided this by the initial number of prey items in order to determine the percentage of prey eaten. I used percentage of prey eaten rather than number of prey eaten to standardize the measurements for the two replicates, since they had different initial numbers of prey. Because I wanted to determine how a range of concentrations affected percentage of prey eaten, I performed a linear regression on the data. The graph of the linear regression examining the relationship between oil concentration and dragonfly activity showed a very weak negative correlation between the two variables (Figure 2). The very low R squared value (.034) reveals that the best fit line is not an accurate reflection of the data at all. Furthermore, the p-value is well over .05 (.612) meaning that the slope is not significantly different from zero. The graph of the linear regression relating percentage of prey eaten to oil concentration showed an overall negative correlation (slope = -.378) (Figure 1). The standard error measurement for the slope is relatively high as there are many data points which are quite far from the line. The R squared value of .527 indicates that the best fit line is a satisfactory representation of the data but is not exceptionally accurate. The low p-value (.017) denotes a significant relationship between the two variables. The results do not support my first prediction of a negative correlation between oil concentration and dragonfly activity. The high p-value suggests that the activity data are a result of random chance and hence no significant relationship exists between the two variables. There are several possible explanations for this. First of all, more data would be necessary to make any solid conclusions about the activity level of dragonfly nymphs. With such a small sample size (four data points in two replicates) results are unlikely to show concrete trends, as any outliers have a significant effect. Secondly, dragonfly nymphs may not be particularly active organisms in general, as they are sit and wait predators and do not resort to active foraging unless it becomes necessary for survival (Gullan and Cranston, 2005). Lastly, activity measurements were taken during the day, while dragonflies tend to be more active at night as an avoidance mechanism from predation by fish and other aquatic organisms (Merritt and Cummins, 1996). Taking more activity data over a longer period of time, with some collections being done at night would likely provide a clearer picture of the relationship between oil pollution and activity levels. It would have been helpful to measure the dissolved oxygen levels in the different environments, as the whole notion of the decreased activity levels was predicated on the notion that surface oil inhibits diffusion of oxygen through the water. Some studies suggest that it takes several months of exposure to oil before a measurable difference in oxygen concentration is detectable. Harrel (1985) studied the effects of an oil spill in a Texas stream, comparing the water quality of the contaminated stream with that of a nearby control stream. Four days after the initial oil spill, oil was visible on the water surface and there was a strong smell of hydrocarbons, but measurements of water quality did not differ much between the two streams. Not until six months later were decreases in dissolved oxygen concentration apparent (Harrel, 1985). If this were the case in our system, then no difference in activity levels would be expected after only five days. Though prediction 1 was not supported, prediction 2, regarding the relationship between oil concentration and predation rate, was supported. The regression line showed a statistically significant negative correlation between the two variables. The reasons for these results are not entirely clear, however, nor are the results free of statistical flaws. One of the biggest statistical problems I encountered was due to the fact that I had different numbers of initial prey items in the two replications. While I tried to standardize the predation measurements by examining the percentage of prey eaten as opposed to the number of prey eaten, this did not completely solve the problem, because there was not a continuous range of possible values for the percentage. For the first replicate, because there were only two prey, there were only three incremental possibilities for predation percentage, 0%, 50% and 100% while in the 2nd replicate there was a broader yet still incremental range (0, 1/6, 1/3, ½, etc). Statistically it would have been far better to have six initial prey items in both replicates. While my initial hypothesis that decreased oxygen levels would lead to less active foraging behavior from the dragonflies and fewer movements (i.e. visual cues) by the damselfly may still hold, it is called into question by the failure of prediction 1. An alternative possibility is that the thick, opaque film formed on the top of the water blocked a large portion of the incoming light and made it more difficult for the dragonflies to clearly see prey. It is also possible that ingestion of toxic water-soluble components of oil led to changes in the predator's ability to search for or attack prey. There is a compelling possibility that the number of prey eaten was more strongly correlated to predator size than to concentration of oil. I did not take quantitative data on predator size, but based on my observations, those predators that ate the largest percentage of prey also tended to be the largest of the predator group. This makes logical sense as large predators have higher energy needs and need to consume more prey in order to satisfy those needs. The size of predators and prey was not a factor that was controlled for and may have had a significant impact on the results. A second factor which was not controlled for but could have affected the results was the presence of secondary food sources. It was assumed that in this environment dragonfly nymphs would prey exclusively upon damselfly nymphs; however, dragonflies are generalists and will consume anything small enough for them to handle. Since pond water was used in the experiment, small prey items such as Daphnia and midges were present in unknown quantities, because their small size made them impossible to filter out. Smaller dragonflies may have preferred to go after these smaller prey items in lieu of damselflies, violating the underlying assumption of the experiment. Future versions of this experiment could be improved by using larger sample sizes and taking more measurements over a longer time period. It would be interesting to include the size of the predator as one experimental factor by measuring either the weight or length of the dragonflies, and examine the interactions between size and oil concentration, and how that effects predation rate, determining which factor seems to have the greatest effect. Also, future experimenters would ideally find a way to ensure that damselflies were the only food resource available to dragonflies. The results of this experiment have implications for those trying to maintain a species balance within aquatic ecosystems. If oil concentration does directly affect predation (in addition to other factors like size) it is important to put forth greater efforts to reduce oil pollution coming into ponds and rivers from everyday sources such as road run-off. Dragonfly and damselfly nymphs both play key roles in aquatic food webs both as predators and as prey. By changing predatory behavior and species composition at one trophic level, oil pollution has the potential to radiate throughout the food web, causing indirect effects up to the human level. Figure 1: Linear relationship between percent concentration of motor oil and percent prey eaten. The negative slope shows a negative correlation between the variables. Figure 2: Linear relationship between percent concentration of motor oil and number of dragonfly movements. Slope of the line indicates a slight negative correlation, but a high p-value makes the data insignificant.

BIO.G0.03.3,Comparison of Hypothesis Testing in a High vs. Low-impact Journal,Biology,Research Paper,"The development of a testable hypothesis is an important part of the scientific method and is a key characteristic of good science. Hypotheses help to define the focus of research and create experiments that can provide answers to meaningful questions. Without well-defined hypotheses researchers run the risk of making erroneous conclusions from data that was not collected in an experiment appropriately designed to test for those conclusions. In this study I examined the difference in frequency of hypothesis testing between two journals. I hypothesized that the best quality journals would be most selective in accepting submissions and therefore would be most likely to publish articles which strongly adhere to the scientific method. I predicted that the highest quality journals would have more articles with a clearly defined hypothesis than lower quality journals. As a quantitative measure of journal quality I used the journal impact factor which is defined by ISI as, a measure of the frequency with which the 'average article' in a journal has been cited in a particular year or period (Thomson Scientific website). The rating is calculated by dividing the number of times articles from the previous two years in the journal were cited in the current year by the total number of articles published in the previous two years. The use of the journal impact factor as an indicator of journal quality is controversial in the scientific community, as a number of concerns have been raised about it; however, for the purposes of this study it provides the best objective and quantifiable measure of quality. In order to test my prediction that articles from higher-impact journals would have clearer a priori hypotheses, I examined five articles from each of two different journals. For the high-impact journal I selected Ecology, which is in the top ten of ecology journals with an impact factor of 3.7. As a comparatively lower-impact journal I selected Plant Ecology, with an impact factor of 1.28. Articles were selected based on time of publication (2000-2005 only) and subject matter (invasive plant species). In evaluating each article based on the clarity of the hypothesis, I assigned each article a rating from 1 to 3. A rating of three is indicative of an indisputably clear hypothesis stated in the article abstract or introduction. A two signifies that some background theory and research questions were addressed, but no specific hypotheses were provided. A rating of one designates those articles that did not have any indication of a hypothesis being tested. Table 1 shows the ratings I assigned to each article as a quantification of the clarity of the hypothesis being tested in the experiment. Articles are numbered according to the order that they are presented in the literature cited section at the end. All five articles in the journal Ecology received the highest rating, indicative of clear hypotheses unambiguously stated in the article's introduction. Hypothesis testing in Plant Ecology varied from 1-3. The data appear to support the hypothesis and prediction, as all articles from the high-impact journal had clearly stated hypotheses compared with only two from the lower-impact journal. Admittedly, this is not a conclusive finding as the sample size used was quite small and the ranking system was not completely objective or scientific. For the articles given a rating of 3, hypotheses were explicitly stated, generally in the form we hypothesized that& or the typical if&then format. All of these articles addressed their hypothesis in the discussion, stating whether it was supported or contradicted. In all cases where the results were inconsistent with the hypothesis, alternatives hypotheses were proposed along with ideas for future investigation into the a posteriori hypothesis. The article that received a two (article 7) listed a series of questions the study was designed to address but did not suggest an answer to any of these questions a priori. In the discussion at the end, the authors addressed each question individually and proposed several a posteriori hypotheses based on the data they collected. Interestingly, this illustrated some of the problems associated with this style of experimentation. The authors acknowledged that they were unable to provide an answer to their first question because their experimental design was unsuitable for doing so. Similarly, few concrete answers were found for the subsequent questions as the authors were primarily only able to provide speculation based on data and observations. Had they designed experiments to test specific a priori hypotheses, perhaps they would have been able to make more definitive conclusions. The two articles that received a rating of one broadly defined the aims of their experiment but did not narrow the scope enough by providing a specific hypothesis. The introductions of article 10 and article 8 explained what they hoped to determine as a result of the experiment but did not provide any predictions or indicate any expected results. Both papers were more exploratory in nature but both achieved results which seemed to satisfy the objective of their study. All papers seemed to be logical and well-organized, partly due to the fact that all scientific papers follow a similar format: abstract followed by introduction, materials and methods, and so on. This essentially forces the author(s) to structure the paper in a way that is logical for the reader. The only way in which the presentation of papers might be improved is by making a more explicit connection between a hypothesis and the experiment designed to test that hypothesis. When papers have multiple hypotheses in the introduction and multiple tests described in the methods section, it would be helpful to know which test was done specifically to address a particular hypothesis. Hypothesis testing has always been presented as a cornerstone of science so it is surprising that a significant number of science articles are being published without clear hypotheses. The results of this study suggests that there is a possible positive correlation between a journal's impact factor and hypothesis testing within its articles, though more study needs to be done. In order to test this hypothesis more thoroughly it would be important to use larger sample sizes and select articles from additional publications with both high and low impact factors.

BIO.G0.04.2,Drosophila Lab Report,Biology,Research Paper,"Drosophila melanogaster is an ideal genetic model organism in several respects. Because of its small size it is easily manipulated, its short life cycle allows for genetic analysis over several generations in a short period of time, its few chromosomes simplify genetic analysis, and previous researchers have already identified and mapped many mutations. The overall purpose for this experiment was to map unknown heritable mutations in Drosophila to their chromosomal locations. The main hypothesis was that the three mutant traits, dark body color, white eye, and short longitudinal veins, were being inherited in a normal autosomal recessive pattern. Specifically, our aims were to cross unknown Drosophila stock to Oregon-R and to Marker flies, with previously mapped chromosomal mutations, to determine for each mutant trait the method of inheritance and the chromosomal location. Specific hypotheses are: that genes for body color are segregating normally, genes for wing venation are segregating normally, body color and wing venation genes are independently assorting, two genes determine eye color, the two eye color genes are independently assorting, and the eye color genes are linked to the body color gene. Cross A P: U-4033 female x Ore-R male Table 1 - F1 Results: Organized Data F1 were wild type for all three mutant traits, with no difference between male and female phenotype. Table 2 - F2 Results: Raw Data (Note: M=male, F=female, wt=wild type, m=mutant) F2 progeny had four distinct eye colors, with red the most frequent, but white, orange, and brown appearing with similar frequencies. Light body occurred more frequently than dark body. Cross B P: Ore-R female x U-4033 male Table 3 - F1 Results: Organized Data F1 were wild type for all three mutant traits, with no difference between male and female phenotype. Table 4 - F2 Results: Raw Data (Note: M=male, F=female, wt=wild type, m=mutant) F2 progeny had four distinct eye colors, with red the most frequent, but white, orange, and brown appearing with similar frequencies. Light body occurred more frequently than dark body. Table 5 - F2 Results of Crosses A & B: Organized Data More wild type phenotypes appear for both body color and wing venation. Table 6 - Eye Color Data from F2 of Crosses A & B Red eye color is the most frequent, and white, orange, and brown appear with similar frequencies. Table 7 - Cross II - F1 Male backcross progeny (wt=wild type, m=mutant) Dark body color shows up with Bristle Lobed; mutant wing venation never shows up with Bristle Lobed. Table 8 - Cross III - F1 Male backcross progeny (wt=wild type, m=mutant) With one exception, dark body color does not show up with Glued Stubble. Mutant wing venation does show up with Glued Stubble. Table 9 - Cross A, B, & I: F2 (wt=wild type, m=mutant) Red eye color appears most frequently, and white, orange, and brown appear with similar frequencies. Light body color is more frequent than dark body color. Wild type wing venation is more frequent than mutant wing venation. Crosses A and B were set up as reciprocal crosses in order to determine whether the unknown mutations were autosomal or sex-linked and dominant or recessive. From the Cross A - F1 results (Table 1), we conclude that the pattern of inheritance for all three mutations is recessive, because they do not appear in the F1 offspring, and autosomal, because the F1 males appear wild type. If any of the mutations had been sex-linked, F1 males would have received a mutant gene from the P female and a Y chromosome from the P male and would have presented a mutant phenotype. From the Cross B - F1 results (Table 3), we also conclude that the pattern of inheritance for all three mutations is recessive because they do not appear in the F1 offspring, but we cannot determine whether the mutations are autosomal. If all the mutations were autosomal, F1 progeny would have one mutant and one wild type copy of each gene and a wild type phenotype. If any of the mutations were sex-linked, they still would not show up in the F1 progeny because the females would have one X chromosome with a wild type copy of the genes, giving it a wild type phenotype, and the males would only have a wild type copy of the mutant genes on their X chromosome from the P female. However, since the reciprocal crosses produced the same results, we can conclude that the mutations are autosomal. If genes for body color are segregating normally as hypothesized, we expect a F2 ratio of wild type body color to mutant body color of 3:1. Based on the combined F2 results of A and B, we observed a ratio of 3.4:1 (Table 10). The X2 value for these results is 1.39, which corresponds to a p value greater than 0.05, and we can deduce that the mutant body color gene is segregating normally. A 3:1 phenotypic ratio corresponds to an autosomal recessive trait so we conclude that the body color gene is autosomal recessive. With the null hypothesis that genes for wing venation are segregating normally, we expect a F2 ratio of wild type wing venation to mutant wing venation of 3:1. From the combined F2 results of A and B (Table 11), we observed a ratio of 3.5:1. The X2 value for these results is 2.25, which corresponds to a p value greater than 0.05, and by the same reasoning as above, we deduce that the wing venation gene is autosomal recessive. We next hypothesized that body color gene and wing venation gene were assorting independently. With this hypothesis we expect a ratio for wild type body color and wild type wing venation: mutant body color and wild type wing venation: wild type body color and mutant wing venation: mutant body color and mutant wing venation of 11.9:3.5:3.4:1 (Table 12). We observed a ratio of 13.2:4.0:3.9:1.0; the X2 value for this set of data is 0.24, corresponding to a p value greater than 0.05, and we can deduce with that body color and wing venation are assorting independently. We observed red, brown, orange, and white eyes in a ratio close to 6:1:1:1 in the F2 progeny (Table 6). Based on this we propose that two genes (orange eyes, a, and brown eyes, b) are involved in the expression of eye color, because with the simplifying assumption that each mutant gene has two alleles, at least two genes are needed to produce four phenotypes. Our hypothesis of interaction is a parallel pathway where at least one wild type copy of each gene is needed to produce the wild type red eye (Fig. 1). Our null hypothesis for their association is that they are independently assorting. This gives a X2 value of 61, which corresponds to a p value less than 0.05 and a strong rejection of the hypothesis. Therefore the two genes for eye color are linked. F1 progeny were all a+b+/ab (ab received from the unknown parent and a+b+ received from the wild type parent). Because crossing-over during meiosis only occurs in female gametes, all male gametes were either ab or a+b+, and recombinant female gametes were a+b or ab+, producing the following recombinant genotypes and phenotypes: a+b/ab (brown), a+b+/ a+b+ (red), ab+/ab (orange), and ab+/a+b+ (red). Based on the frequency of these recombinant genotypes within the F2 progeny, the two eye color genes are located 45.4 map units apart. Overall the data from F1 and F2 of Crosses A and B did not present any problems and from it we concluded that the three mutant traits have a high probability of being autosomal, body color and wing venation have a high probability of assorting independently, and it is highly probable that two linked genes control eye color. Crosses II and III were set up with unknown flies crossed with Marker II and Marker III stocks respectively. Marker II and Marker III stocks serve as chromosomal markers because they carry dominant homozygous lethal mutations. Marker II has mutant alleles of the Bristle and Lobed genes and a wild type allele of the Curly gene on one copy of chromosome II and wild type alleles of the Bristle and Lobed genes and a mutant allele of the Curly gene on the other copy. Because these three mutations are dominant, these flies should present short bristles, curly wings, and small lobed eyes but the bristle phenotype does not show up in the Marker II flies we have. Marker III has mutant alleles of the Glued and Stubble genes and a wild type allele of the chromosomal inversion LVM on one copy of chromosome III and wild type alleles of the Glued and Stubble genes and a mutant allele of the chromosomal inversion LVM on the other copy. As these three mutations are dominant, Marker III flies have small, smooth eyes and short blunt stubbles (LVM has no mutant phenotype). Both marker stocks are true-breeding because any progeny that do not have the same genotype as the parents lethally receive two copies of at least one mutation (Fig. 2). In order to map body color and wing venation genes to chromosomes, we set up F1 male backcrosses for Crosses II and III. In a F1 male backcross, F1 males showing a marker phenotype are crossed to unknown females. In the backcross progeny, if an unknown mutant trait shows up with a marker, then the mutant trait and marker are on different chromosomes; if they do not show up together, they are on the same chromosome. For Cross II - F1 male backcross progeny, dark mutant body color shows up with both Bristle Lobed and Curly markers, indicating that the body color gene is not on chromosome II with them (Table 7). Mutant wing venation never shows up with Bristle Lobed or Curly, indicating the wing venation gene is on the chromosome II with those markers. For Cross III F1 male backcross progeny, dark mutant body color does not show up with Glued Stubble markers, indicating the body color gene is also on chromosome III (Table 8). Mutant wing venation does show up with the Glued Stubble markers, indicating that the wing venation gene is not on chromosome III. There is one exception of a dark bodied, Glued Stubble fly, but as it is only one fly, this is probably due to human scoring error or the presence of a random fly from the lab during scoring. Overall the Cross II and III F1 and male F1 backcross data strongly support the conclusion that body color gene is on the chromosome III and wing venation gene is on chromosome II. We set up Cross I between unknown virgin females and crossveinless forked Marker I males and carried the cross through the F2 generation. In the F1 generation we expected to see all phenotypically wild type females and all crossveinless forked males (Fig. 3). However, we saw wild type males instead of crossveinless forked males and Glued Stubble males and females. Possibly some Marker III males were among the parents, which would account for the presence of Glued Stubble. Since every F1 progeny should have received a mutant gene from the unknown parental female for crossveinless and for forked, all males should show both traits. We do not believe the absence of crossveinless forked males is from scoring error, as we checked many flies repeatedly. An alternate explanation is that the unknown females were not virgin when introduced and produced phenotypically wild type progeny, or that the parental females were not from unknown stock. As we determined from Crosses A and B, the eye color genes are autosomal. By the combined F2 data from Crosses A, B, and I (Table 9), if we hypothesize that the two eye color genes are independently assorting with each other, we get a X2 value of 98, which corresponds to a p value less than 0.05. So, we must reject the hypothesis and conclude that the two eye color genes are linked. The F1 progeny for all three crosses are all a+b+/ab (ab received from the unknown parent and a+b+ received from the wild type parent). Because crossing-over during meiosis only occurs in female gametes, all male gametes were either ab or a+b+, and recombinant female gametes were a+b or ab+, producing the following recombinant genotypes and phenotypes: a+b/ab (brown), a+b+/ a+b+ (red), ab+/ab (orange), and ab+/a+b+ (red). Based on the frequency of these recombinant genotypes within the combined F2 progeny, the two eye color genes are located 44.2 map units apart. In Table 9, mutant eye color and mutant body color appear together less frequently than mutant eye color and mutant wing venation (54 versus 126). In our skeletal report we interpreted this to mean that the wing venation gene and eye color genes were more independent than the body color gene and the eye color genes, and we assigned eye color genes to the chromosome body color is on, chromosome III. We used the body color and eye color data in Table 13 to calculate map distances of 65.9 map units between d (dark body color gene) and a, 67.3 map units between d and b, and 44.2 map units between a and b. This produced the final results seen in Table 15 (p. 15 of Skeletal Report) and Fig. 4 (p. 15 of Skeletal Report). The map in Fig. 4 for chromosome III does not make sense (we have the distance between d and b calculated directly as 67.3 map units, and indirectly by using the distances between d and a and a and b as 110.1 map units) because the eye color genes should really be on chromosome II (as clarified by Jessica Lehoczky). For this report we realized that we misinterpreted our data for the skeletal report. Since in the P generation, mutant eye color, body color, and wing venation all appear together, then linked genes will continue to appear together and unlinked genes will tend to appear separately. Since mutant eye color and mutant wing venation appear together more frequently than mutant eye color and mutant body color, eye color genes are linked to the wing venation gene on chromosome II. With this assignation in Table 14 we calculated map distances of 42.2 map units between sv (short longitudinal vein) and a, 86.4 map units between sv and b, and 44.2 map units between a and b. Table 16 and Fig. 5 show the final determined genetic map for our unknown Drosophila. Although the calculated map distances for sv, b, and a with respect to each other on chromosome II differ from the given values of sv (II:3.8), a (II:57.0), and b (II:104.5) (as clarified by Jessica Lehoczky), they are more logical than the distances found when body color and eye color genes are linked. The difference between our experimentally determined map distances and the actual numbers could be due to scoring error, crossing error, or an insufficiently sized pool. Looking at Table 16, we can see that in U-4033 Drosophila the unknown genes orange (a), brown (b), dark body (d), and short veins (sv) are all autosomal recessive, with genes a, b, and sv on chromosome II and gene d on chromosome III. The linked genes a, b, and sv are mapped on chromosome II with respect to each other as shown in Fig 5. To help further clarify our data, Oregon-R, unknown mutant, and marker stock Drosophila melanogaster were studied. Oregon-R have a wild type phenotype, unknown mutant have dark bodies, white eyes, and short longitudinal veins, and marker stocks have crossveinless wings with forked bristles, curly wings with small eyes and short bristles (although short bristle was undetectable), or small oblong eyes with short blunt stubbles. Flies were anethesized with CO2 or Fly Nap and manipulated with paintbrush or pick under the microscope. They were sexed, collected, crossed, and scored as described in the Biology 306 Introductory Genetics Laboratory Manual. Crosses A, B, I, II, and III were set up initially. Cross A had unknown virgin females crossed to Ore-R males and as a reciprocal cross, Cross B had unknown males crossed to Ore-R virgin females. The F1 progeny were used to deduce whether the unknown mutations were autosomal or sex-linked and recessive or dominant. F1 progeny in both crosses then produced F2 progeny to examine the relationship between the mutant genes. Cross I had Marker I males crossed to unknown virgin females and a subsequent F1 x F1 cross, Cross II had Marker II males crossed to unknown virgin females and a subsequent male backcross, and Cross III had Marker III males crossed to unknown virgin females and a subsequent male backcross. All of these crosses were used to assign the mutant genes to chromosomes, and the Cross I F2 progeny were used along with the Cross A and B F2 progeny to map the two eye color genes.

BIO.G0.04.3,Conjugation Lab Report,Biology,Research Paper,"Bacteria are unicellular, haploid organisms that are suited for experiments because they reproduce rapidly by binary fission, produce genetically identical progeny, and are genetically simple. Normal bacteria can grow on minimal media, media containing only water, a carbon source, and inorganic salts, but some mutant auxotrophic bacteria have specific nutritional requirements. These requirements can be used to select for or against specific strains. Some bacteria can transfer a copy of accessory DNA to another by conjugation. During conjugation, cells containing a sex factor, F+, unidirectionally transfer a copy of this sex factor to cells lacking the sex factor, F-, through a conjugation canal. Because the conjugation canal is easily broken, the entire F factor rarely transfers, and so genes closer to the origin of the F factor (the first point to enter the F- cells) will appear with greater frequency among the resulting progeny. Once the F factor has been transferred the new genes will be expressed if they are dominant, and recombination can occur between the new genes and the DNA of the recipient cell. This phenomenon can be used to map bacterial genes. The frequency with which a particular gene appears in exconjugant progeny depends on its distance from the origin, and the number of recombinant progeny can be used to determine relative map distance between genes. In this experiment we conjugated F+ and F- cells with different genotypes and plated the resulting exconjugants onto different selective media plates. Our purpose was to determine the order of the genes involved with the selected traits relative to the point of origin, and to determine relative map distances between genes if possible. From the media 1 replica plates, we counted a total of 144 colonies, with the most on media 1, followed by media 5, media 2, media 3, and media 4 (with zero colonies). From the media 2 replica plates, we counted a total of 137 colonies, with the most on media 2, followed by media 5, media 3, media 1, and media 4 (with zero colonies). The tabulated results are in Tables 1 and 2. Plate 1 lacked threonine-leucine and selected for TL+, plate 2 lacked proline and selected for pro+, plate 3 lacked glucose and contained lactose and selected for lac+, plate 4 lacked glucose and contained galactose and selected for gal+, and plate lacked methionine and selected for met+. Plate 3 selected for lac+ and plate 4 selected for gal+ because each of those plates selected for bacteria that could utilize lactose and galactose as the sole carbon source, respectively. Among the media 1 replica plates, colonies 1, 2, 4, 10, 20, 23, and 36 did not grow on the media 1 plate, and therefore could not be taken into account for any of the other plates since we could not tell if these colonies on other plates did not grow because of the specific media they were on or because they were plated improperly (Table 3). Among the media 2 replica plates, colonies 1, 6, 34, and 35 did not grow on the media 2 plate, and therefore could not be taken into account for the other plates (Table 4). With these adjustments, the total number of colonies on media 2 replicate plates was 134 and the total number of colonies on media 1 replicate plates was 130. More colonies grew overall on media 2 replica plates than media 1 replica plates, indicating that more colonies received the pro+ gene to survive on the pro- media than received the TL+ gene to survive on the TL- media, and that the pro gene must then come before the TL gene on the F factor. To determine the order of the other genes with respect to each of these markers, for each set we ranked the plates in order of most colonies grown due to received DNA. For plates 1, 2, 3, and 4, this was the number of colonies grown, but for plate 5 this was actually the number of colonies that did not grow since the original F- bacteria were met+ (Tables 3 and 4). So, F- bacteria grew on plate 5, but exconjugant bacteria that received the met- gene did not. For the media 1 replica plates, the colonies grew best on media 1, followed by media 2, media 3, media 5, and media 4. Based on these results, the gene map is: TL, pro, lac, met, and gal (Fig. 1). For the media 2 replica plates, the colonies grew best on media 2, followed by media 3, media 1, media 5, and media 4. Based on these results, the gene map is: pro, lac, TL, met, and gal (Fig. 2). The map based on media 2 plates is better because we know from above that the pro gene is closer to the origin than the TL gene. Since the two maps are inconsistent, we have to modify map 2 to take into account map 1. Based on the example in lecture notes, the modified map is lac, pro, TL, met, and gal (Fig. 3). On this map, the pro and lac genes are closer to the origin than the TL gene, so we can use the TL+ data to determine the distances between pro-TL and TL-lac (but not with gal or met since you can only determine map distances between markers and genes that enter the F- cell before them). Based on the TL+ data, pro and TL are 37.2 map units apart and lac and TL are 60.5 map units apart. From this we infer that lac and pro are 23.3 map units apart. However, looking at colonies selected for lac+ out of the pro+ colonies, the calculated map distance is 23.9 map units. Since calculating small distances is more accurate, we conclude that the map distance between lac and TL is 61.1 map units (Fig. 3). Once again, we cannot calculate any distances involving met or gal since they are farther from the origin than both of the markers we selected for. The slight discrepancy in the results could be due to scoring error, plating error, or other random error we have no control over (such as bacteria that does not grow as well as it should or bacteria that spontaneously mutate to grow when it should not). To compensate for the scoring error, we could dilute our bacteria by another factor of 10, but this would probably make the resulting data pool too small. A better alternative would be to repeat the experiment several times and then calculate the genetic distances using a large pool of data. We studied conjugation in bacteria and the gradient of transmission method to map five genes on an F factor. We determined that with respect to the point of origin, the genes are in the order: lac, pro, TL, met, and gal, and that the relative map distance between lac and pro is 23.9 map units, between lac and TL is 61.1 map units, and between pro and TL is 37.2 map units.

BIO.G0.07.2,"Plasmid Transfer, Genetic Stability and Nisin Resistance in Lactococci",Biology,Research Paper,"Lactococci are important because they have several applications to the biotech industry. They are used in the dairy industry as cheese starters because they are able to metabolize lactose and produce lactic acid. Bacteriocin genes such as nisin encoded on lactococcal plasmids prevent food from spoiling. The main aim of this investigation was to examine the phenotypic transfer of lactose utilization, proteinase production, and nisin resistance by conjugating two lactococcal strains. Results showed that there were more nisin resistant transconjugants than any other phenotype and this is to be expected since nisin is encoded on a self-transmissible plasmid. It was not uncommon for plasmids of different sizes to be observed in transconjugants due to recombination events facilitated by insertion sequences present on the plasmids. Not all phenotypes matched up with the particular plasmid makeup that would be expected, again because of recombination events between plasmids and also with the chromosomal DNA of the transconjugant. Lactococcal strains have several important industrial applications. In particular the species Lactococcus lactis has very simple and well characterized biochemical pathways and is added to milk to start the cheese making process. Starter cultures ferment sugars to produce lactic acid which serves to acidify milk and give cheese its flavor and texture (McAuliffe 2001). Lactococcal enzymes that utilize lactose as an energy source (confer Lac+ phenotype) are plasmid encoded as are several other essential enzymes. Bacteriophage resistance, protease and peptidase production, bacteriocin production and resistance are also encoded by genes that are present on native lactococcal plasmids (Cotter 2003). Serine proteases (confer Prt+ phenotype) degrade casein and thus provide the cells with the amino acids they need to grow. Food spoilage caused by pathogenic bacteria is prevented by the bacteriocin nisin that is encoded on several plasmids native to Lactococcus lactis (Takala 2002). The cells must also be resistant to nisin if they produce it (NisR phenotype). Nisin production and resistance, preptidase production, and lactose utilization all give lactococcus advantages in certain environments and are transferred through conjugation from donor to recipient cells by way of plasmids. Conjugation is dependent on transfer (tra) genes and certain self-transmisible plasmids can mobilize other non-transmissible plasmids. Insertion sequences (IS) are present on several lactococcal plasmids and cause recombination events to occur. During conjugation or mobilization, plasmids can recombine so as to produce new plasmids of different sizes and with different genetic makeups. The aim of this investigation was to analyze phenotypic transfer in transconjugants of Lactococcus lactis ssp lactis by selection of individual markers conferred from donor plasmids. Donor and recipient strains Donor strain: M189 (Lac+, Prt+, NisR) StrS; plasmids 60, 56, 40, 24, 3.7kb were combined and placed onto a nutrient agar plate to allow for conjugation to occur. The donor strain contained several different sized plasmids. The phenotypes associates with these various sized plasmids are as follows: The 60kb plasmid encodes tra genes and also has insertion sequences so it is therefore self-transmisible and the IS's allow for recombination events to take place. After conjugation, cells were spread onto three different selective media plates in three replicates. The selection plates used were M17L + Sm, FSDA + Sm, and M17G + Sm + Nis; see Table 1 for an explanation of the phenotypes these selection plates are used to identify. Donor and recipient cells were also separately spread on these selective plates as controls. The number of colonies on each plate was recorded. Ten transconjugants from each of the three selective media plates were selected and streaked for single colonies on their respective medias. These single colonies were then pick and patched onto each of the three selective media plates in order to identify the growth response for the particular transconjugant. The phenotype of the transconjugants was recorded in terms of lactose utilization, nisin resistance, and proteinase production. Within the class each of the different possible phenotypic combinations were chosen and inoculated into M17G broth. The plasmids of these transconjugants were extracted and run on an agarose gel in order to visualize the plasmids present in the transconjugant. See the detailed procedure in the Micro3021 Microbial Genetics Course Kit (Cavicchioli 2005, p. 52-55). Table 1: Selective media plates used in investigation six and the phenotypes they convey After the conjugation mix was plated onto the selective media plates the number of transconjugants was recorded, see Table 2. These transconjugant counts show the relative transfer frequency of various phenotypes. The most transconjugants, ~900 colonies, were found on the M17G + Sm + Nis plates followed next by the FSDA + Sm plates with ~500 colonies and the M17L + Sm plates had 15 transconjugants. Table 2: Initial transconjugant counts on selective media after conjugation Table 3: Transfer frequencies of various phenotypes After single colonies were pick and patched onto the selective media plates many different phenotypic combinations were observed. The results in Table 3 show the class frequency of each phenotype as a percentage. There was a higher frequency of the NisR phenotype than any other phenotype. The agarose gel phenotypic profile of our class showed that our results were not adequate to complete the report and so plasmid extraction data (Figure 1) and a table of the frequency of transconjugant plasmid profiles for given phenotypes collected throughout the years of this investigation (Figure 2) from Jeff Welch were used. In Figure 1, lanes two and three are the control donor and recipient strains. All of the plasmids (60, 56, 40, 24, and 3.7kb in size) can be visualized in the donor and there are no plasmids in the recipient. The lanes four through twenty-four show the size of plasmids that are present in cells that exhibit certain phenotypes. Part of the initial transconjugant counts, Table 2, and transfer frequency data, Table 3, was expected. First, the most growth, ~9000 transconjugants/ml, was observed in the M17G + Nisin + Sm plates and the least growth, ~150 transconjugants/ml, was observed on the M17L + Sm plates. We would expect more nisin resistant colonies (growth on M17G + Nisin + Sm plates) than Lac+ colonies (growth on M17L + Sm plates) because nisin resistance is encoded on the 60kb plasmid that is self-transmissible and does not depend on any other plasmid to mobilize its transfer and therefore transfers at a greater frequency. Another reason there are more nisin resistant transconjugants than Lac+ is also because several of the plasmids in the donor strain encoded nisin resistence, both the 56kb and the 60kb plasmids, while only the 40kb plasmid conferred the Lac+ phenotype. There is an over-representation of Prt+ transconjugants. The number of colonies per milliliter would be expected to be similar to the Lac+ since both phenotypes are encoded on a single plasmid that is not self-transmissible. Table 3 depicting the transfer frequencies of various phenotypes further shows that the NisR phenotype is more common than the Lac+ phenotype and this is because of the same reasons mentioned previously. Jeff Welch also kept records of phenotype frequencies over several years as shown in Table 4. This collection of data has an over-representation of the NisS phenotype, in particular the Lac+ Prt- NisS phenotype is the most frequent of all of the phenotypes. These skewed results can be explained when one considers that this investigation is set up so that each of the possible phenotypes is chosen for plasmid extraction and so the rarer phenotypes appear to be more common than they actually are. Some of the various phenotypes in Figure 1 relate to the genotype or plasmid composition that would be expected. For example, lane thirteen has the phenotype Lac- Prt+ NisR and has two plasmids of sizes 56kb and 60kb. Proteinase is encoded on the 56kb plasmid and nisin resistance is encoded on both the 60kb and 56kb plasmids. The transconjugant did not have the 40kb plasmid that confers lactose utilization and the Lac- phenotype is fittingly observed. Another transconjugant where the phenotype and plasmid makeup match up is number twenty-three. The phenotype is Lac+ Prt- NisR and the 56kb plasmid encoding proteinase is missing. The plasmid extraction gel in Figure 1 reveals the presence of plasmids that are of different sizes than the ones found in the donor strain. Different sized plasmids with varying genetic composition can be obtained through recombination events among the plasmids. The transconjugant in lane number nine is Lac+ Prt+ NisS but only has one plasmid that is greater than 60kb. It is likely that the 40kb (Lac+) plasmid and the part of the 56kb plasmid that confers the Prt+ phenotype recombined to form this novel sized plasmid that gives this particular phenotype. It is also possible that the Lac and/or Prt genes recombined with the chromosome of the transconjugant and confer the Lac+ Prt+ NisS phenotype in that way. Recombination events happen when insertion sequences are present flanking certain genes. These sequences are marked for excision from the plasmid and insertion into either another plasmid or chromosomal DNA. An example of a transconjugant where it is likely that a chromosomal recombination event occurred are lane numbers four and five of Figure 1. These transconjugants have 56kb and 60kb plasmids most likely giving them their Prt+ and NisR phenotypes, but there is no 40kb plasmid present that would confer the Lac+ phenotype that is observed. This data suggests that the Lac gene recombined into the chromosomal DNA. In summary, the nisin resistant transconjugants were more frequent observed because NisR is carried on a self-transmissible plasmid and is also present on more than one plasmid while the other phenotypes, Prt+ and Lac+, were only carried on one plasmid each. Some phenotypes matched up with their expected genotypes, but there were many that did not. Transconjugants with plasmids of sizes different than those present in the donor strain were observed because recombination events occurred.

BIO.G0.07.3,Genetic Analysis of a Mutant Strain of Drosophila Melanogaster,Biology,Research Paper,"Drosophila melanogaster was the organism used in this genetic investigation. The genetic mutations in unknown strain number 4254 were characterized and their genetic loci were mapped. Wild type flies have red eyes, gray bodies, and a normal wing venation pattern. The unknown strain had white eyes, a black body, and a mutant wing venation characterized by a gap in the second horizontal wing vein. Reciprocal crosses and marker crosses were conducted in order to determine the modes of inheritance for each gene and resolve map distances. The gene for body color, b, and wing venation, v, were both found to be recessive single gene traits that are linked on chromosome 3, refer to Figure 1 for the location of these genes relative to marker III mutations small Glued (Gl) eyes and short Stubbled (Sb) bristles. Eye color was found to be a two gene, w and n, trait characterized by a recessive epistatic relationship between the two genes. ww is is epistatic over n+_ or nn. A fly with a genotype of w+_n+_ has a wild type red eye phenotype, a w+_nn fly has orange eyes, and a wwn+_ fly and also wwnn fly has white eyes. The eye color genes were linked to the X chromosome and their loci were mapped along with marker I mutations for wings lacking crossveins (cv) and bent/forked bristles (f), according to Figure 1. Figure 1: Genetic loci of mutations in unknown strain 4254 This experiment used the model organism Drosophila melanogaster, more commonly known as the fruit fly, which is one of the most valuable organisms in genetic and developmental research today. Drosophila has been used for many years in research and its entire genome has been sequenced. The life cycle for the fruit fly is short, ten to fourteen days, with a developmental time of nine days and because of this, experimental results can be generated relatively quickly. Drosophila flies are inexpensive to maintain in the laboratory setting and are easy to manipulate. All of these characteristics contribute to the wide use of this organism in genetic research today. This experiment aimed to characterize an unknown mutant strain of flies through genetic analysis by answering several questions that this experiment was designed to answer. First, how many of the phenotypic differences in the unknown strain are inherited? And of the inherited traits, how many genes are involved in defining the trait? Moreover, how are the genes inherited, are they dominant, recessive, autosomal, sex-linked or do they have some other inheritance pattern? Finally, where are the genes for the identified traits located on the chromosomes? In order to answer these questions, scoring information from reciprocal crosses between the unknown flies and known wild type flies were coupled with scoring data from crosses with three marker strains that have mutations in genes of known chromosomal locations. Three marker strains were used corresponding to the three main pairs of chromosomes in D. melanogaster (Drosophila has a forth pair of chromosomes but they are very small and do not code for many genes). In order to completely characterize and map any unknown mutations F2 progeny were generated from the reciprocal crosses and the sex chromosome marker cross and male backcross progeny were generated from the two other marker cross progeny. Another supplemental objective of this experiment was for the experimenters to learn how to work with Drosophila melanogaster. Skills in the handling and maintenance of this frequently used organism are valuable tools to add to a future molecular biologists repertoire. Eight bottles of unknown mutant flies were obtained and their phenotypes were recorded. Two bottles of wild type flies were also obtained and all unknown and known bottles were cleared of adults. The wild type strain used was Oregon-R (Ore-R) characterized by a gray body, red eyes, and normal wing venation. Virgin females (virgin @) and males (B) were collected from the unknown, wild type, and marker strains. The marker number represents the chromosome number that the known mutations in that strain are on. Refer to the MCDB 306 Genetics Laboratory Manual for further details about these strains. Reciprocal crosses A and B, and marker crosses I, II, and III were set up in duplicate according to Table 2 Phase I Crosses. Approximately ten females and twenty males were added to each of the crosses described. One hundred flies were scored from each of the F1 crosses before the bottles were cleared and more virgin females and males were collected in order to set up the second round of crosses. In Phase II cross A, B, and marker cross I were used to create F2 progeny by crossing the F1 progeny. Phase II marker crosses II and III were male backcrosses between unknown females and mutant marker males. See Phase II Crosses in Table 2. The scoring results from phase I and II crosses were analyzed and the genetic inheritance pattern, linkage data, and map distances were determined. Table 2: Phase I and phase II crosses The F1 progeny of cross A and B were tabulated, see Table 3. In both A and B crosses, all of the F1 progeny (B and @) had wild type body color and wild type wing venation which suggests that these mutant phenotypes are recessive. Furthermore, males and females were distributed approximately equally for the body color and wing venation trait in both crosses which suggests that the genes for body color and wing venation traits are autosomal. Table 3 shows that all cross A females have wild type eye color and all males have mutant eye color. This pattern of inheritance is indicative of a sex-linked gene since males receive only the mutant allele they have the mutant phenotype but females have one wild type allele and one mutant allele so they have a wild type phenotype given that mutant eye color is a recessive trait. Cross A F1 females all inherit one copy of the wild type eye color gene which is enough to confer the wild type phenotype so eye color is a recessive trait. Phase II of the A and B crosses involved a cross between the F1 progeny, see Table 4 for body color and wing venation results. Table 3: F1 progeny of A and B Crosses Table 4: Phase II cross - F2 progeny of A and B crosses If body color and wing venation are two allele, recessive, single gene traits with complete dominance then they would be expected to segregate 3:1 wild type:mutant. The body color trait segregated 3.56:1 wild type gray body:mutant black body. A �2 test was conducted which did not reject the hypothesis that body color is a recessive single gene trait. The wing venation trait segregated at a ratio of 4.4:1 wild type:mutant wing venation and a �2 test rejected the hypothesis that wing venation is a recessive single gene trait (Skeletal Report 5). This data conclusion is not consistent with the F1 progeny data that showed that wing venation was a recessive trait. However, since only a small number of F2 flies were scored there is a chance of random error which may explain the unexpected result of the �2 test. Scoring errors or expressivity/penetrance problems of the wing venation mutation could also have been factors in this unexpected result. Since the genes for body color and wing venation have been characterized as autosomal, another �2 test was conducted to see whether the two genes were independently assorting. If two genes independently assort then the expected dihybrid ratio of F2 progeny is 9:3:3:1, wild type:single mutant:other single mutant:double mutant. A modified dihybrid ratio had to be created based on the observed F2 ratios in order to more accurately judge independent assortment based on the data generated from this experiment. See Table 5 for the modified expected ratios and expected number of flies for the dihybrid cross compared to the actual observed numbers for each of the four phenotypes. If the genes were segregating independently then a ratio of 15.7 : 4.4 : 3.56 : 1 would be expected; however, there are approximately three times more double mutants than would be expected if the genes were segregating independently which logically suggests that the genes are linked. And indeed, a �2 test rejected the hypothesis that the genes for body color and wing venation are independently assorting so the alternative is that they are linked. The map distance between body color and wing venation was calculated to be 29.14 m.u. (Skeletal Report 6) Table 5: Determining independent assortment or linkage between body color and wing venation (modified dihybrid ratio) As Table 6 shows, a new orange eye color was observed in the F2 generation and there are only wild type females in cross B F2 progeny. Based on this data, the best hypothesis for the interaction that creates eye color is a two gene epistatic interaction where homozygous white eye mutations are epistatic over homozygous or heterozygous orange mutations. The proposed interaction is: The expected results based on this hypothesis are that the two genes for eye color are linked on the X chromosome because the F1 data showed that eye color is sex-linked and the only explanation for having only wild type F2 females for cross B is if this is the case. See Page A of the attached Skeletal Report for the details of the crosses and how alleles segregate to give this pattern of inheritance. The map distance between the two eye color genes, w and n, was calculated from cross A F2 data to be 28.57 mu. Marker crosses II and III were conducted in order to map autosomal genes, which in the case of this unknown included the genes for body color and wing venation. Each of the mutations in the M2 and M3 strains was dominant and homozygous lethal. The marker stocks were part of a balanced lethal system which consisted of a true breeding heterozygote combination of known marker mutations. Crossovers are suppressed in this type of genetic setup and the original Bl L / Cy and Gl Sb / LVM genotypes for marker II and marker III, respectively, were conserved. The initial M2 and M3 marker crosses produced F1 progeny that were expected from the conclusions based on A and B reciprocal cross progeny. All progeny were either Bristle Lobed or Curly in M2 or Glued Stubbled or wild type in M3 because those mutations were dominant in the marker stocks. All F1 progeny had wild type body color and wing venation because these two genes were determined to be autosomal and recessive. In phase II crosses, F1 males were backcrossed to unknown mutant females and if the recessive mutation showed up with the male backcross progeny (Br L or Cy for marker II and Gl Sb for marker III) and four phenotypes were present in the F1 male backcross progeny, then the gene for the mutation is not linked to that marker's chromosome. If a recessive mutation is linked to the markers chromosome, then the mutant phenotype would not show up with male backcross progeny and only two phenotypes would be present in F1 male backcross progeny. The results of phase II male backcrosses are summarized in Table 7. Table 7: Cross II and III F1 male backcross progeny Cross II (M2) Cross III (M3) Green colored numbers were scored from F1 curly (M2) or wild type (M3) Bs x unknown @s Black colored numbers were scored from F1 Bristle Lobed (M2) or Glued Stubbled (M3) Bs x unknown @s Table 7 data from cross II shows that mutant body color and mutant wing venation segregated with the male backcross curly progeny. This means that the body color and wing venation genes are not on the second chromosome. The mutations did not segregate with the Bristle Lobed marker mutations in this experiment, but it would be expected that a larger population of flies would show mutant body color and mutant wing venation showing up together in the F1 male backcross progeny. Cross III shows that mutant body color and mutant wing venation do not segregate with F1 male backcross progeny suggesting that these genes are located on the third chromosome. Two flies were scored to be Glued Stubbled, dark body, white eye, wild type wing venation, marked by an asterisk in Cross III. This unexpected result is likely due to a scoring error. The mutant wing venation gene was given to be at locus 47 m.u. and was said to have a smaller map distance than the gene for body color. The map distance between the genes for wing venation and body color was calculated to be 29.14 m.u. This information is enough to assign a location on chromosome three to each of these three genes, see Figure 2. Figure 2: Gene loci on chromosome 3 Marker cross I was conducted in order to map sex-linked genes, which in the case of this unknown included the genes for eye color. The mutant marker genes present on the X chromosome are recessive and produce a crossveinless (cv) forked (f) phenotype. The initial M1, M2, and M3 marker crosses produced the expected mutant white eye color male and wild type red eyed female F1 progeny. All M1 F1 progeny were wild type for marker 1 mutations (cv f) since all males received a normal copy of these genes from the unknown female parent. Based on the analysis of F2 data of crosses A and B the two eye color genes were determined to be linked on the X chromosome. The possible genotypes and phenotypes for Cross I F2 progeny are depicted in Tables 8 and 9 as well as the number of male flies scored in each of the phenotypic categories. Only males were included in this table and in determining map distances because it is only males that carry information about crossover events that are needed to map genes. The female progeny had approximately equal numbers (~64 flies) of red eye and white eye progeny and half that number (34 flies) of orange progeny. Table 8 and 9 are set up as three point crosses with only one of the marker I mutations included in relationship to each eye color gene. Table 10 is a two point cross for the marker mutations (cv and f) that shows the phenotype and number of male progeny in each category. These two and three point crosses were used to calculate the map distances between cv, f, w, and n on the X chromosome, see Table 11. For calculation details refer to page 11 of the Skeletal Report attached. After finding that the map distance between cv and f was slightly off from the actual known distance, the map distances between all other genes were corrected using the correction factor (43/41.7). The numerator in this factor is the actual distance between cv and f and 41.7 was the experimental map distance. Table 11 shows corrected map distances. The map distances in Table 11 along with the relative number of flies in each category give enough information to determine gene order. The cv-w and cv-n distances add together to give the distance between w and n which tells that cv is between w and n on the chromosome. In the f-w-n three point cross the least number of flies were found in the orange forked phenotype which was assumed to be the double cross over event. In a double cross over the only gene that will be different from the parental genotype will be the gene in the middle of the two crossovers. The genotype of the F1 female parent was f w+ n+ and the genotype of the double cross over was f w+ n. The gene that is different from the parent is n which means that n is in between f and w. The locus of each gene was finally determined using the gene order and map distance data explained above coupled with the given locus of gene w at 1.5 m.u.. See Figure 3 for a diagram of the X chromosome and the locus of the eye color and marker I genes. Figure 3: Gene loci on the X chromosome These results are summarized in Table 12.

BIO.G0.08.1,Analysis of a Mutant Strain of Drosophila,Biology,Research Paper,"Drosophila Melanogaster, known as the common fruit fly, is often used in genetic research. An unknown fruit fly, U-5309, was found to have several characteristics that deviate from the Oregon-R wild type strain. These characteristics are white eyes, shortened longitudinal veins, and dark body. It was determined that the mode of inheritance for the white eye color mutation is sex-linked, recessive, and controlled through epistatic gene interaction between two genes white (a) and orange (b); the gene for white is epistatic over the gene for orange. The mode of inheritance for both the dark body color (d) and shortened longitudinal veins (sv) is autosomal recessive and each controlled by a single gene. Both mutant alleles were discovered to be located on chromosome 3. The determined location of each of the examined genes aside the known marker mutations used in this experiment is found below. (Figure 1) Figure 1 The fly Drosophila Melanogaster is one of the most studied organisms used in biological research in genetics and is considered a model system for several reasons: they contain only 3 pairs of autosomal chromosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes; the entire genome has been sequenced; they are small and easy to grow in the laboratory; they have a short generation and high productivity; and the males do not show recombination. The purpose of this experiment was to determine the number of genes involved in each mutant phenotype (white eye color, dark body color, short veined wings veins), the mode of inheritance for these mutations, and the genetic loci of each of these genes. The experiment was carried out in three main steps. Unknown flies with wild type flies underwent two reciprocal crosses to determine the mode of inheritance for each mutation; the analysis of the F1 and F2 generations revealed whether the mutant phenotypes were dominant or recessive and autosomal or sex linked. In the next step, U-5309 virgin females were separately crossed with males from M2 and M3 marker stocks that contained known mutations on autosomal chromosomes 2 and 3 respectively. The F1 males of these crosses were back crossed to U-5309 virgin female flies in order to ascertain the genetic loci of the autosomal mutations. Finally, a cross between U-5309 female flies with male flies of known marker mutations on the X chromosome (M1) was carried out to the F2 generation in hopes of establishing the genetic loci of possible sex linked mutations. The flies were prepared for observation and handling by anesthetization using CO2. The flies were then transferred to CO2 pad and examined and counted under a microscope. (See pg. 1-6 of lab manual for more details). Several different strains of flies were used for this experiment: unknown mutant strain U-5309, wild type Oregon R strain, and three marker mutation strains with known mutations. The genotypes and phenotypes for each strain are listed in Table 1. Table 1. Genotypes and phenotypes of fly strains In this experiment, 5 different crosses were used. In Cross A, Oregon-R males and U-5309 virgin females were crossed to produce an F1 generation. The males and females of the F1 generation were then crossed with each other to produce an F2 generation. Likewise, U-5309 males and Oregon R virgin females were crossed to produce an F1 and F2 generation in Cross B. In a separate cross, Cross I, U-5309 virgin females were crossed with M1 males also to produce an F1 and F2 generation. In Cross II and Cross III respectively, U-5309 virgin females and M2 and M3 males were carried out to the F1 generation, and then the F1 males were backcrossed with U-5309 virgin females. (See pp 19-25 of lab manual for more details) The F1 data of crosses A and B show the wild type phenotype for body color in both males and females (Tables 2 and 3). This signifies that the wild type phenotype is dominant over the mutant dark body phenotype. The F2 results of crosses A and B show two phenotypes, light and dark body, in both males and females. The presence of both wild type and mutant body color in the F1 and F2 generations indicate that the gene for body color is autosomal. In the F2 generation, there is a sizable majority of light body color over dark body color, which further supports that dark body color is a recessive mutation and independently assorts (Table 4). Chi square analysis was used to determine whether body color is a single gene trait that independently assorts properly to produce a 3:1 phenotypic ratio in progeny. The p value was calculated to be 1.86 x 10-3, which indicates that our data body color is not segregating properly. This either implies that there may be another factor that influences the segregation of body color alleles so that they do not independently assort, or that a larger sample of F2 progeny should be examined to produce more accurate results. Table 2. F1 of cross A (U-5309 virgin @x Oregon R B) Table 3. F1 of cross B (U-5309 B x Oregon R virgin @) The F1 data of Crosses A and B also show wild type phenotype for wing venation in both males and females. This suggests that the mutant wing venation is recessive and autosomal. Furthermore, the F2 generation shows males and females both containing both wild type and mutant longitudinal wing venation, and also resulted in significantly more wild type longitudinal wing venation (503) than the mutant phenotype (115). This suggests that the gene for wing venation undergoes independent assortment. However, chi square analysis to test if wing venation is a single gene trait that undergoes independent assortment produced a p value of 2.43x10-4, which indicates that wing venation is not undergoing independent segregation properly. This result, similar to body color, indicates that there also may be another factor influencing body color segregation or that a larger sample of F2 progeny should be examined to produce more accurate results. Chi square analysis was also used to see if longitudinal wing venation and body color genes assorted independently from each other. Using the observed ratios obtained from body color data and wing venation data separately, chi square analysis produce a p value of 0, which led to the conclusion that body color and longitudinal wing venation did not assort independently from each other. Recombination analysis produced a genetic map distance of 42.1 map units between the two genes. (See Appendix for all chi square calculations) The Cross A F1 results for eye color produced all females with red eyes and all males with white eye color. (Table 2) The females of the F1 generation must all be heterozygous, which shows that the mutant eye color is a recessive mutation. However, since the F1 generation only contained males with white eyes, the gene for eye color was determined to be sex linked; all the males in the F1 generation receive one X chromosome from the mutant female parent, and a Y chromosome from the wild type male parent which does not contain any corresponding wild type alleles. The Cross B F1 results for eye color show both male and female flies with red eyes (Table 3) This is because the males inherit their single x chromosome from their wild type female parent. Table 4. F2 body color and wing venation data of crosses A and B Table 5. F2 eye color data from crosses A and B Figure 2: Proposed Pathway for eye color inheritance The F2 generation of Cross B produced several different eye color phenotype: red, white, and orange (Table 5). This suggests that there are two genes involved in determining eye color. The appearance of specifically three different eye colors suggests that eye color is controlled by two genes showing epistatic interaction (Figure 2). The high number of mutant phenotype observed indicates that the gene coding for white eyes (a) is epistatic over the gene coding for orange eyes (b). Also in the B Cross F2 generation, only the red eye phenotype was found in females. If the two genes had undergone independently assortment, the females in F2 would contain more than one phenotype. However, females only showed wild type phenotype for eyes, indicating that these two genes are linked. Moreover, the unequal appearance of different eye colors between the male and female flies of the F2 generation in cross B further supports the previous conclusion that the genes for eye color located on the x chromosome. Using recombination analysis, the genetic map distance between the two genes controlling eye color was determined to be 30.0 map units for cross A and cross B combined. In order to determine the genetic loci of the two linked autosomal recessive mutations of U-5309, body color and wing venation, males from the M2 and M3 balanced marker stocks were crossed with U-5309 virgin females in Crosses 2 and 3 respectively. The crosses produced an F1 generation that showed wild type phenotypes for both wing venation and body color, as expected. Balanced marker stocks are true breeding heterozygous strains that maintain the same genotype through a homozygous lethal system. 50 flies of each cross were scored to confirm that the marker mutations, body color, and wing venation were all assorting properly. Continuing Cross 2, male F1 flies with lobed eyes were back crossed with virgin U-5309 females. There were not enough progeny from this cross for allow for statistical significance. However, from the few flies that were scored, the back cross progeny showed three distinct phenotypes: light body, normal wing venation, and bristle lobed; light body normal wing venation, and curly wing; dark body, mutant wing, and curly wing. Since dark body color and mutant longitudinal wing appeared with the marker mutations, it indicates that the body color gene and wing venation gene are not located on the same chromosome as the marker mutations, the 2nd chromosome (Figure 1B). The white eye phenotype also appeared with the marker 2 mutations in male backcross progeny, confirming that the genes for eye color are not located on the 2nd chromosome, as expected. The less stable homozygous lethal system of the marker genes along with the exposure of CO2 to the F1 males may account for the extremely low backcross progeny count. Cross 3 was continued by back crossing male F1 flies with virgin U-5309 females to see if the body color gene and wing venation gene are located on the 3rd chromosome. There were only two different phenotypes observed in the progeny: light body, normal wing venation, glued eyes, and stubble bristles; dark body, mutant wing venation. Only wild type phenotypes for body color and wing venation appeared with the marker mutations glued eye and stubble bristles in the male backcross progeny, indicating that both wing venation and body color genes are both on the 3rd chromosome. It was known that the wing venation mutation is located at 0 on the chromosome 3. Therefore, according to the distance between the two genes previously determined through recombination analysis, the location of the body color gene is at 42.1 map units on the third chromosome, between the genes for glued eye and stubble bristles (Figure 1C). To discover the genetic loci on the x chromosome of the two genes controlling eye color, virgin U-5301 females were crossed with marker 1 males (Cross I). The F1 generation contained red eyed females and white eyed males, as expected. Among the 50 female progeny of the F2 generation, the phenotype found in the least number was orange eyes. This further supports our conclusion of an epistatic relationship between the two genes. A total of 104 male progeny were scored and 6 phenotypes were observed with the possibility of 8 different genotypes between the three genes: cv, a, b. (Table 6). The phenotypes that occurred twice were corrected to the number of its corresponding recombinant allele in order to account for having two possible genotypes. Since the location of gene a already was already known to be at position 1.5, the distance between gene a and gene cv was used to determine the correction factor. The corrected distances showed that the distance between cv-b was the largest, thus placing gene a between cv and b (Table 7). However, this would place gene b in a location entirely off of the chromosome. Therefore it was predicted that the data collected was not representative of the actual genetic loci of gene b. Table 6. 3-point cross between cv-a-b Table 7. cv-a-b 3-point distance calculations Table 8. 3-point cross between f-a-b Another 3 point cross was calculated to determine the location of the two eye color genes in relation to the known forked bristle gene of the marker mutation. (Table 8). Similar to the cv-a-b cross, the phenotypes that occurred twice were corrected to the number of its corresponding recombinant allele in order to account for having two possible genotypes. The distance between f-b was calculated to be the largest, therefore supporting the placement of gene a between genes b and f. Since the locations of gene a and gene f were both given, the distance between them was used in the correction factor. (Table 9). Table 9. f-a-b 3-point distance calculations One possible explanation for the inconsistent results in the 3 point crosses could be attributed to the difficulty in distinguishing between orange and red eyes of the back cross progeny in Cross I. Also, if more Cross 1 F2 progeny had been scored, perhaps more accurate results could be obtained. A 2-point cross was also determined between cv-f. (Table 10) Based on knowing the actual gene loci of genes cv and f, it was expected that would be more crossveinless and forked bristled progeny than actually observed. The calculated map distance between the two genes based on our observed results was 3.8, which is significantly smaller than the known 43 m.u. It is not reasonable to use the correction factor of 43/3.8 to correct the values derived from the 3-point crosses because the values calculated would be much larger than the actual chromosome. Scoring more than progeny may have resulted in relatively more recombinant progeny, therefore producing a more accurate distance between the two genes. Table 10. cv-f 2-point cross Based on previously knowing the locations of genes a, cv, and f, and only looking at the relative positions of the genes to each other, the gene order should be b-a-cv-f. However, the map distances between the four genes given in the point crosses are significantly inconsistent with each other. All three point crosses placed gene b in a location off of the actual x chromosome. Because of these unfeasible results, the genetic distance determined through recombination analysis of Crosses A and B was ultimately used to determine the location of gene b. Since the location of gene a at 1.5 is known, gene b must be located at position 31.5. This would place gene b between gene cv and gene f at positions 13.7 and 56.7 respectively (see Figure 1). In our experiment, it was determined through crosses A and B that the genes for wing venation and body color are autosomal, recessive, and linked. From the F2 generation of both crosses, the genetic distance between the two genes was calculated to be 42.1. Crosses II and III located gene d and gene sv on chromosome 3. Although Cross II did not produce enough back cross progeny for significance, the data obtained still suggested that genes sv and d were both located on the 3rd chromosome. Therefore, given that the location of gene sv is at 0 on chromosome 3, it was determined that the location of gene d is at position 42.1 of the same chromosome. Through Cross A and Cross B, it was revealed that our mutant eye color is controlled by two genes that exhibit epistatic interaction. The gene for white eyes is epistatic over the gene for orange eyes. Based on the phenotypes of the F1 and F2 generations, it was found that the genes for eye color are also recessive and sex linked. The two 3-point crosses and one 2-point cross analysis of Cross I resulted in a location for the orange eye gene that was unfeasible. Since the genetic location of gene a on the x chromosome was previously known, the location of gene b was determined to be at position 30.0 based on the recombinant frequencies calculated from crosses A and B. This would place gene b between the marker genes cv and f at 13.7 and 56.7 m.u. respectively. 1. Skeletal Report 2.

BIO.G0.10.1,Bacterial Conjugation and Gene Mapping in E. Coli,Biology,Research Paper,"In this experiment we studied the phenomenon of conjugation between two members of the E.Coli species, Hfr and F-. We used selective media to grow conjugated recombinants to determine genetic loci of these genes in relation to an origin of transfer. We used the method of uninterrupted mating. We then plated the original suspension on these specific media plates. The final viable colonies were counted and organized by recombined phenotype, allowing us to calculate genetic map distances of the genes in the bacterial chromosome and determine the order of entry of the genes into the F- bacteria from the Hfr strain. We determined that the order of entry was lac+ first, pro+ next, followed by TL+, gal+, and if met- had made it all the way through the conjugation tube it would be last. Below is a chromosomal map of our map distance findings for the genes transferred by the Hfr. Hfr Gene Map Origin of Transfer We used bacterial conjugation to measure genetic distances and observe recombined phenotypes through the use of E. Coli, specifically, an Hfr strain that is F+. This categorization indicates that the bacteria contain a non-attached, transferable sex factor that can be donated to an F- strain, which we introduced through uninterrupted mating. This creates a donor pair, the male is known as a genetic donor, F+ and the female as a genetic recipient, F-. Bacterial conjugation is the formation of a very fragile conjugation tube that creates a canal for the F factor to be transferred. The canal is created through contact of pili from one bacterium to the cell wall of another, known as collision. Next, the bacteria must identify each other as a donor-acceptor pair. Once the conjugation tube has been formed, the transfer occurs. This is an energy dependent, sequential transfer that is unidirectional and proceeds at a slow but constant rate. The selecting gene must then be expressed phenotypically, if they are dominant. Finally there must be integration of the gene into the replicated genome of the accepting bacteria. This specific order of operation sets limitations to conjugation. The gene that is closest to the origin of transfer has the greatest chance of getting into the F-cell's chromosome. The origin of transfer is the point at which a break occurs in the integrated F factor. This is the leading point of the chromosome to be transferred. By selecting for a certain gene that we expect to be transferred and analyzing the amount of bacteria that grew in the specified media, we can determine genetic distances between these genes and are able to tell where recombination about these genes took place. Table I Genetic Markers of Two E. Coli Strains Table II In addition to thiamine, the following supplements were supplied to the corresponding plates: To begin the process of conjugation, we mixed 0.2 ml of Hfr culture with 1.8ml of F- culture. We then incubated the mixture at 37oC for 60-70 minutes, this is known as uninterrupted mating. We then took the mixture out of incubation and added 1ml of it to 9ml of nutrient broth for dilution. This created a concentration of 10-1. With a pipette, we transferred 0.1ml from the original solution to three plates, media 1, 2 and 4. We then transferred 0.1ml from the diluted solution to three new plates, media1, 2, and 4. These six plates were then incubated at 37oC for 48 hours. The following day, the plates were scored and 2 master plates were created from the viable colonies, one on media 1 the other on media 2. We chose to create our master plates from the original solution, and allow our dilution plates to be used by other students. These plates were then incubated at 37oC for 24 hours. Once the incubation period had passed, we replicated the master plates onto the above mentioned media plates. The media 1 master plate was replicated to media 2,then 3,then 4,then 5, and finally to media 1. The media 2 master plate was replicated to media 1, then 3, then 4, then 5, and finally to media 2. Once results were observed, the following day, the plates were placed into cold storage until they could be viewed by the GSI. In this experiment we found that through uninterrupted mating of the Hfr and F-, we get the highest number of viable colonies from the media 2 plate, which selects for Pro+. We then see that the media 1 plate, which selects for TL+, exhibits the next highest number of colonies and finally that the least number of colonies grows on media 4, which selects for Gal+, as supported by the Table III of the appendix. We see from the media 1 master selection plate series that the most number of colonies grew on media 1, selecting as previously mentioned, and media 5, which selects for Met+, followed by media 2, also selects as previously mentioned, then media 3, which selects for Lac+. The least amount of colonies grew on media 4, the Gal+ selecting plate. The numerical data for the media 1 master plate selections can be found in Table IV of the appendix. The data from the media 2 master selection plate series shows the highest amount of growth on the media 2, as well as media 5. Media 3 plate had the next highest amount of colonies followed by media 1, to leave only media 4 as the plate having the fewest colonies. This information can be found with numerical values for colonies in Table V of the appendix. Through the methods of selection we conclude that the first gene to enter the F- cell is Lac+ gene, which indicates its location as being the closest to origin of transfer. Following the Lac+ gene, in order, we see that Pro+, TL+, and Gal+ enter successively. We determine that the Met- gene from the Hfr was not expressed phenotypically in our recombinants. This is because any bacteria containing this gene, assuming it is dominant, would not have survived our selective media 5. The order of entry of these genes was determined through three criteria found through the analyses of the plates. The first criteria came from our initial uninterrupted data that told us through order of decreasing quantity that Pro+ must be closer to the origin of transfer Than TL+ and Gal+ because the media 2 plate had the most colonies. TL+ comes next followed by Gal+. The second criteria comes from our analyses of the TL+ selection plates which tells us that in this selection, Pro+ must be closer to TL+ than Lac+. The third criteria comes from the Pro+ selection plate series that tells us when selecting for Pro+, Lac+ must be closer to Pro+ than TL+. Through creation of organized tables (please see appendix) of the recombinant phenotypes, we are able to calculate map distances between the genes selected for and those that come between it and the origin of transfer. Table VI in the appendix has the data and calculations for the map distances carefully outlined. Below is a map of our found genetic order of entry as well as the calculated map distances of the selected genes. The discrepancy in the two calculated distances between the TL+ and Lac+ in Table VI is 10 mu. This could be due to the fact that we had more recombinants between crosses 1 and 4 of the media 1 selection than expected and less recombination between crosses 1 and 3 of the media 1 selection. In order to find a perfect correlation between the calculations, we would have needed more colonies that had recombined to give us a TL+ Pro+ Lac- phenotype. We could repeat the experiment to determine whether this was the case or whether there was a discrepancy in the media 2 master selection series. We chose to use the values for the map distances that were shorter because it is known that when we determine map units that the direct distance between genes is more accurate that when calculating a distance that passes over genes. Origin of Transfer We can conclude from this experiment that the order of entry is Lac+ first, Pro+ second, TL+ third, Gal+ fourth and Met+ fifth. We can also conclude that the genetic map distance between Lac+ and Pro+ is 24 mu, the distance between TL+ and Pro+ is 36 mu, and consequently the distance between TL+ and Lac+ is 60 mu. We cannot conclude any distances from the origin for Gal+ or Met+ since they entered the F- bacteria after the genes that we selected for.

BIO.G0.10.2,Drosophila Melanogaster Genetic Analysis Experiment,Biology,Research Paper,"In this experiment the Ore-R phenotype (wild type) of Drosophila was crossed with unknown U-2544 phenotype. The Ore-R exhibits a light tan body color with red eyes. It also has all five longitudinal wing venations as well as the two cross veins. The first cross vein is located between the L3 and L4 longitudinal veins and the second between L4 and L5 longitudinal veins. The unknown U-2544 exhibits a mutant dark tan body with mutant white eyes and has mutant longitudinal wing venations that do not fully extend the length of the wing but rather only about 2/3 of the wing length. The U-2544 however does exhibit the two cross veins as the Ore-R phenotype exhibits. We also used three stocks of marker Drosophila known as Markers II, III, and I named for the chromosomal locus of their mutations. We concluded that there are two genes involved in eye color mutations, which are located on chromosome II. Here we have called these genes the ""o"" and the ""b"" genes for orange and brown-eyed mutants respectively. For the body color mutation we found only one gene to bear responsibility and so was named ""d"" for dark body. This gene was found to be located on chromosome III. Also to be found on this third chromosome was our mutant gene for shortened longitudinal wing venation. This gene was named ""w"". The single allele mutations, w and d, were found to both be of autosomal recessive inheritance. The mutations in eye color controlled by two genes were also found to be autosomal and recessive to wild type but epistatic to each other. Below are chromosomal maps of U-2544's first three chromosomes including the genetic locus of the known marker mutations as well as the found locus of the unknown mutations (shown in bold). Chromosome I (X Chromosome) Chromosome II (Autosome) Chromosome III (Autosome) Drosophila melanogaster is a well-studied species that is easily anesthetized and handled. Because of this, as well as its relatively small genome of four chromosomes and short developmental duration of four days to imago, Drosophila is an ideal species for genetic analysis. The fact that virgin female flies, which are necessary in order to ensure proper genetic crossing, are easily extracted from a newly hatched population due to the innate inability of either sex to mate within the first ten or so hours of life, furthers this attraction to Drosophila as a controlled laboratory experiment. In this experiment we take advantage of these characteristics and use them to identify the genetic locus of specific mutations that cause deviations in the wild type phenotypic eye color, body color and wing venation. This can be achieved by performing five crosses. The parental reciprocal crosses, A and B, are performed to determine whether the mutant genes are sex-linked, autosomal, recessive, or dominate. The parental cross of the unknown virgin females with the males of marker stocks' II, III and I provide verification to the findings of the reciprocal crosses as well as confirmation of known information of the dominate marker II and marker III mutations, and the recessive mutations of the marker I stock. The F2 generations of these marker crosses become useful when determining gene interactions and chromosomal locus. By observing the expressed phenotypes in the F2 generation of the reciprocal crosses, we can determine the number of genes involved in a specific mutation, such as eye color, body color, or wing venation and calculate the map distance between them. We can also use chi-squared testing in order to prove or disprove hypotheses of our findings. If it is concluded that two mutations are linked through a chi-squared test, the map distances between them can be calculated through the well-known techniques as discussed in the MCDB 306 lecture. The marker I cross can offer information about sex-linked genes and their locus on the first chromosome. With a population from these three crosses combined, we were able to perform more accurate statistical analysis through the chi-squared test and determine genetic linkage or independent assortment of multiple allele genes than with the reciprocal cross F2 generation data alone. The F2 generation of the marker II and III crosses tell us if the mutations are located on the respective chromosome by a lack of simultaneous expressivities of the phenotype. The map distances between the mutations found to be on those genes can be determined through analyzing the recombinant data from the F2 generation of the reciprocal crosses. Once the flies were carefully removed from their feeding vials, and anesthetized with CO2, they were sexed. Virgin females could be obtained by clearing all flies from the vials and returning to collect and sex them within 10 hours of the clearing. Ten Crosses were then performed, each made in duplicate. Ore-R Drosophila was used as the wild type, U-2544 was used as the unknown mutant stock, and marker stocks I, II and III were used. As a parental cross, U-2544 virgin female were crossed with Ore-R males, this was called Cross A. A reciprocal parental cross was created between the Ore-R virgin females and the U-2544 males, Cross B. U-2544 virgin females were crossed with Marker I males, Cross I. U-2544 virgin females were crossed with Marker II males, Cross II. U-2544 virgin females were crossed with Marker III males, Cross III. Once the F1 generation was scored and analyzed, Crosses A, B, and I were allowed to continue through an F2 generation, with the removal of parents within 7days of set up. Cross II had F1 Bl+ L+ males removed and Cross III had F1 Gl+Sb+ males removed, each to be backcrossed with U-2544 virgin females in new vials. The complete and detailed procedure is described in the MCDB 306 lab manual. The F1 data above indicates that the gene for body color is recessive. This is due to the lack of the mutant appearance in the F1 generation of both Crosses A and B. It also indicates that the mutation is autosomal due to the appearance of the wild type trait in the males. Had the trait been sex linked, the males of Cross A would have received their only X chromosome from the U-2544 mother and exhibited the dark body phenotype. The F2 data for body color produced a 3:1 wild type to mutant phenotypic ratio. Since we can conclude from the F1 generation that the gene for body color is autosomal, it is not necessary to account a female to male ratio. For these results we hypothesize a normal segregation for the body color gene. The chi-squared value for this hypothesis was 0.2411. This result, under one degree of freedom, yields a p-value that is greater than 0.5 but less than 0.9. Therefore we accept our hypothesis of normal segregation for body color. The F1 data for the wing venation is similar to that of the F1 data for mutant body color. The lack of appearance of the mutant trait in the F1 generation allows us to conclude that the mutation is recessive. The fact that the males of the F1 generation of Cross A forces us to conclude that the gene for wing venation is autosomal. The data for the F2 generation yields a 4:1wild type to mutant phenotypic ratio. For this data we hypothesize a normal segregation of the gene for wing venation. The chi-squared value of 9.67 with one degree of freedom indicates a p-value that is much less than 0.005 and therefore we must reject the hypothesis and conclude that the wing venation gene does not segregate normally, and that it is linked. The results of body color and wing venation combined produce a ratio that cannot be used to easily conclude whether the two traits are linked or whether they independently assort. Therefore we calculate a chi-squared test with a hypothesis that they do assort independently. With this assumption we calculate a value of 104.305. This result, under three degrees of freedom, yields a p-value that is much less that 0.005 and therefore the hypothesis must be rejected and we conclude that the mutant genes d and w are linked. Knowing this, we can calculate the map distance using the amount of recombinants in the F2 generation. Here we calculated that map distance between d and w to be 44.2 mu. The F1 generation here provides us with the same information as found for the body color as well as wing venation mutations. We can conclude through the lack of mutant findings in the F1, we can conclude that the mutation is recessive. We can also conclude that it is autosomal due to the fact that the F1 males of Cross A do not exhibit this trait. The F2 generation provides us with two new phenotypes, according to eye color. The red eye color is wild type and as such a parental phenotype. The same is true for the mutant parental white-eyed F2 flies. From this data we hypothesized that there were two genes interacting with each other in order to produce orange and brown eyes. The two genes o and b are epistatic to each other. This meaning that a wild type Ore-r would have o+_b+_ genes, homozygous or heterozygous, as long as one of each dominate gene were present to create the red eye. This would also indicate that our U-2544 would have oobb genes, homozygous recessive alleles for both genes involved in eye color. From this we state that the orange-eyed phenotype will be oob+_, homozygous recessive for the o gene expressing that it is epistatic to the b+ wild type gene. Similarly, we state that the brown-eyed phenotype will be o+_bb, homozygous recessive for the b gene expressing that the presence of two mutant alleles results in epistasis. Through Mendel's experiments with his peas, it is known that two genes that are independently assorting form a 9:3:3:1 ratio, given that each trait yields a 3:1 ratio. From the high amount of double recombinant phenotype in the F2 generation we can conclude that the genes for eye color are in fact not independently assorting but linked. This can be seen even without doing a chi-squared test by comparing the 9:3:3:1 expected ratio to the 10:1:2:3 found ratio. We calculated the map units between the two genes to be 43.6 mu. The marker stocks are used in order to verify chromosomal locus. The known mutations are dominant Cy, Bl, and L in marker II stock, and Gl and Sb in the marker III stock. These mutations are known to be homozygous lethal, which form what we call a balanced lethal system. The F1 generation of these marker crosses alone does not tell us anything more than that which we have learned from the reciprocal crosses. When males of the F1 are separated and crossed with U-2544 virgin females, called a male backcross, we can use the resultant phenotypes to determine whether or not the selected trait is on chromosome II or III. Because of the lack of recombination in male Drosophila, we determine that the mutant genes appearing with the marker mutations reveal that they are not on the same chromosome. For example, we found the gene d, dark body, to be located on chromosome III. This was discovered through a male backcross of the marker III F1 progeny. The genotype of the F1 male is Gl+ Sb+ d+/ Gl Sb d, and it is crossed with a U-2544 female whose genotype is Gl+ Sb+ d+/ Gl+ Sb+ d+. Since there is no recombination in male Drosophila, and any recombination in the female would not change the genotype, we can conclude that any progeny would have the wild type allele d+ in its genotype and be dominant over our mutant gene. If the genes were not linked, the fact that there is no recombination between chromosomes in males would be irrelevant. This backcross theory is relevant to any backcross. The results from our marker III male backcross indicates that neither the body color gene, d, nor the wing venation gene, w, appear with the marker III mutations. From understanding of what the male backcross can tell us, we know that these genes must be located on the chromosome III. It is seen that the eye color mutation does appear with the chromosome III mutations and therefore cannot be located on the same chromosome. We then conclude that the genes must be located on chromosome II. This information would be indicated by a backcross of the marker II stock, had it thrived. The cross failure was probably due to over exposure of the sensitive marker II stock to the CO2 anesthetizing agent. Because of this mating failure between any male progeny and the U-2544 virgin females, we must deduce the chromosomal locus through a process of elimination using other experimental and known information. Since we know that o and b are not sex linked, they cannot be located on chromosome I. It is known that o and b are not located on chromosome four. Now that is experimentally determined through male backcross that o and b are not on chromosome III, we can only conclude that they must be located on chromosome II. Combining the found information of crosses A, B and I provide us with a larger population and more accurate data for eye color analysis. By performing a chi-squared test we can test a hypothesis of independent assortment between the two genes. The result had a value of 277.46 yielding a p-value that was much less than 0.005 and so disproving our hypothesis. From this we can conclude that the o and b genes are linked. We use the recombinant data to calculate a map distance of 45.3 mu between o and b. From this experiment it is concluded that the eye color mutations are linked and located on chromosome II. The gene o has a genetic locus of 59.2 mu while b has a genetic locus of 104.5 mu. It was also found that wing venation and body color mutations are linked and located on chromosome III. The w gene has a genetic locus of 0mu and d can be found at 44.2 mu. Crosses A and B's F1 generations provided us with the knowledge that the U-2544 mutations were autosomal recessive. The resulting F2 generations from these reciprocal crosses allowed us to perform chi-squared statistical analysis proving that the body color and wing venation genes are linked. The F2 generation data also allowed us to determine that two genes are involved in eye color, that they are epistatic to each other. We also used this data to determine an estimate of map distance between them. The male backcross of the marker crosses was necessary to determine chromosomal locus. In the case of the U-2544, it turns out, only the marker III cross was necessary in determining chromosomal locus. Through this cross, we determined that w and d were located on the third chromosome and that o and b were not. The marker cross I gave us additional information in calculation of the map distance between the two eye color genes. Had our mutant genes been sex linked, it would have been necessary to find the chromosomal locus. The loss of the marker II cross was regrettable but not detrimental to our conclusion that the eye color genes had a chromosomal locus here, due to the fact that Drosophila has a limited genome, one of the main reasons for using Drosophila in genetic analysis. The following maps indicate the chromosomal and genetic locus of the unknown mutations as well as the loci of the marker mutations.

BIO.G0.11.2,Mapping of Genes in a Mutant Strain of Drosophila Melanogaster,Biology,Research Paper,"Drosophila Melanogaster (the common fruit fly) is convenient as a model organism for use in genetic experiments. By analyzing crosses in mutant and wild-type strains of Drosophila, the mapping of genes can be accomplished. In this experiment, U-4182 was the mutant strain used. This parental mutant strain possessed a dark body color, white eyes, and incomplete longitudinal veination. The purpose of this experiment was to determine the inheritance patterns of these genes as well as to locate the position of the genes on the chromosomes. To accomplish this task, numerous crosses were performed. Reciprocal crosses between mutant and wild-type strains established the patterns of inheritance of the mutant genes. The crosses also showed that the eye color was actually controlled by two genes: orange eye (a) and brown eye (b). Both genes were needed to create red eyes. Crosses with marker strains M1 and M3 were used to determine linkage relationships and the locations of the mutant genes. Body color (d), orange eye (a), and brown eye (b) were all established to be on chromosome 2. Specifically, body color was at locus 48.5 map units (mu), orange eye was at locus 38.7 mu, and brown eye was at locus 58.9 mu. The location of the wing venation mutation (w) was inferred to be on chromosome 3. All of the mutations are autosomal recessive. Chromosome 2 (Autosome): Chromosome 3 (Autosome): Drosophila Melanogaster is useful as a model organism because it has a short life cycle of 10-14 days. Their short lifespan and small size make it easy to culture and relatively inexpensive to store large numbers of flies. Additionally, numerous mutant phenotypes are easily seen with or without the aid of microscopes so observing and separating the flies is not a painstaking task. Because Drosophilahas a very long history in biological research, there is a tremendous amount known about its genome. The knowledge about wild-type and marker strains will help in identifying where the mutant genes are and how they are inherited. Ultimately, the purpose of this experiment was to characterize unknown mutations in a mutant strain of Drosophila Melanogaster. The goal was to determine the inheritance patterns of these mutations as well as to locate the specific position of the genes on the chromosomes. By comparing a pure line wild-type strain, known as the Ore-R strain, with the mutant strain, known as U-7812, distinct differences were found in the expression of body color, eye color, and wing venation. To find out how these three different phenotypes were created, various crosses were performed. In order to find out how the mutations were inherited (sex-linked verses autosomal; dominant verses recessive), reciprocal crosses between the Ore-R strain and mutant strain were performed. The progeny of the F1 generation underwent further reciprocal crossing to produce an F2 generation which was used to determine how the mutations are inherited. In addition to these reciprocal crosses, a series of marker crosses were performed using M1 and M3 marker strains (Note: Marker 2 was not available). The marker strains contain mutations with known positions on their respective chromosomes (M1 is the X-chromosome, M3 is chromosome 3), so they could be used to decide whether the marker mutations were linked with the unknown mutations. Female unknowns were crossed with males from the marker strains. An F1 cross was completed for the M1 group, while a male back-cross was performed for the M3 group. These marker crosses provided information to establish linkage relationships of the unknown genes and to assign each gene to a specific locus. Four different strains of Drosophila melanogaster were used. All of the flies in the stocks are true breeding. The Oregon-R (Ore-R) stock contains wild-type flies have red eyes, complete wing veination, and tan-colored bodies. U-7812, the unknown stock with white eyes, dark body, and incomplete longitudinal veination, was utilized in every cross. The Marker 1 stock had crossveinless (cv) and forked (f) mutations, which are located on the X-chromosome. These mutations were eventually found to be sex-linked recessive. The Marker 3 stock had glued eyes (Gl), stubble (Sb), and LVM mutations, which are located on chromosome 3. These mutations were eventually found to be autosomal dominant. LVM flies express the same phenotype as a wild-type fly would; the actual difference is that an LVM fly has an inversion on chromosome 3. LVM is homozygous lethal and therefore serves as a balancer lethal system in the M3 crosses. 10 U-4182 virgin females were crossed with 20 Ore-R males. 10 Ore-R virgin females were crossed with 20 U-4182 males. 10 U-4182 virgin females were crossed with 20 M1 males. 10 U-4182 virgin females were crossed with 20 M3 males 15 male and 10 female F1 progeny from the parental cross of A were transferred into a separate container and crossed. 15 male and 10 female F1 progeny from the parental cross of B were transferred into a separate container and crossed. 15 male and 10 female F1 progeny from the parental cross of I were transferred into a separate container and crossed. 15 Glued-Stubble males from the F1 progeny of cross III were crossed with 10 U-4182 virgin females. All crosses were performed twice and all protocol in performing the crosses as well as the handling of all drosophila strains can be found in the MCDB 306 lab manual. All flies were put to sleep using carbon dioxide gas. After all F1 progeny were hatched, 100 flies were scored from crosses A, B, I, and III. After F2 and backcross progeny had hatched, 200 flies from each F2 generation were then scored with phenotype data recorded for all crosses. The F1 results as shown above support that there is an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance for the mutant alleles for wing venation, body color, and eye color. If the mutations in the U-7812 strain had been dominant, all of the F1 progeny would have expressed the mutated phenotypes. This is because all of the F1 progeny are heterozygous for the mutant gene. Also, if the mutations had been sex-linked, then all of the male F1 progeny would be mutated. This is because males have one X-chromosome from their U-7812 female parent, meaning any mutations would be expressed. Neither of these patterns was supported by the data gathered, but autosomal recessive inheritance of the alleles was supported. Therefore, it can be concluded that all three mutant alleles show an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. The F1 results as shown above support that there is a recessive pattern of inheritance for the mutant alleles for wing venation, body color and eye color. Like in Cross A, if the mutations in the U-7812 strain had been dominant, all of the F1 progeny would have expressed the mutated phenotypes. Distinguishing between sex-linked and autosomal cannot be done, because it is impossible for either sex to express the mutant phenotype. All F1 male progeny will receive their X-chromosome from their wild-type mother, so males will always express the wild-type phenotype. Females will be heterozygous for the mutant gene. Therefore, from this data, it is only possible to conclude that the genes are recessive. However, with the data from Cross A and Cross B together, it is possible to conclude that the genes are definitely autosomal recessive. It is already known that crossveinless and forked mutations are sex-linked recessive. For the Marker 1 Cross, all of the progeny were wild-type phenotypically. The females were heterozygous for the mutant genes, and the males were all wild-type because they received the wild-type genes from the wild-type mothers. Therefore, the observed data makes sense. It is already known that Glued-eye, Stubble, and LVM are dominant mutations on chromosome 3. However, since Gl, Sb, and LVM are homozygous lethal, mutant flies in the stock must be heterozygous at those loci (Refer to skeletal report to see the actual arrangement of the marker mutant genes as their arrangement is crucial for successful backcrosses). This means that the father has the potential to give one of two different genotypes during mating. Since the unknown female is wild-type for the three genes, the resulting F1 progeny should have two different phenotypes in equal ratios. The data gathered reflects all of these facts, because the F1 progeny are about half Glued-Stubble and half LVM expressing. The observed data makes sense. The data above helped show three major things. First, it showed that the body color gene segregated properly and is controlled by one gene. The data corresponded to an observed ratio of 3.1:1 (wild-type:mutant), which was extremely close to the expected 3:1 ratio hypothesized to arise if there was one gene responsible, and the mutation was recessive. Using X2 analysis, it was supported that body color is inherited through autosomes and that the mutation is recessive. The X2 value of .081 correlated to a probability of 77.6% that the observed ratios would occur due to chance, given the expected ratio. Therefore, body color is autosomal recessive. Secondly, the data showed that the wing veination gene segregated properly as is controlled by one gene. The data corresponded to an observed ratio of 2.96:1 ratio (wild-type:mutant) which again was extremely close to the expected 3:1 ratio hypothesized to arise if there was one gene responsible, and the mutation was recessive. Using X2 analysis, it was supported that wing veination is inherited through autosomes and that the mutation is recessive. The X2 value of .013 correlated to a probability of 90.9% that the observed ratios would occur due to chance, given the expected ratio. Therefore, wing veination is autosomal recessive. Finally, the F2 data shown above helped determine whether the two genes, body color and wing venation, were linked or segregating independently (combined table found in skeletal report). The data presented showed an observed ratio of 10.9:3.8:3.95:1 which was close to the expected 9:3:3:1 ratio expected for two independently assorting genes with recessive mutations. Using X2 analysis, it was supported that the two genes are assorting independently. The X2 value of .898 correlated to a probability of 82.6% that the observed ratio would occur due to chance, given the expected ratio. Therefore, it was concluded that these two genes are localized to different chromosomes in the genome, so this accounts for the independent assortment observed. The F2 data showed the expression of four phenotypes for eye color. The expression of the orange and brown phenotypes in the F2 progeny warranted the proposal that there were two genes controlling eye color. With four phenotypes, there must be at least two genes, but, because there are only four phenotypes, there should only be two genes involved. The genes expressing the orange and brown phenotypes were assigned the names gene a and gene b , respectively. The following table shows how the genes interact to produce the different colors. If the genes were independently assorting, there would be a typical 9:3:3:1 ratio expressed in the F2 generation. The data does not support this, as there are far more white-eyes flies than orange-eyed or brown-eyed. Since having white eyes requires that both genes are homozygous recessive, the genes are unlikely to be assorting independently. The data supports that the two eye color genes are linked, so crossing over may be occurring in the female flies. It makes sense that the brown and orange eyes are least expressed because they are recombinant phenotypes. The map distance between the two genes can be calculated using the combined data of crosses A and B. Orange-eyed and Brown-eyed flies are recombinant phenotypes, so crossing over had occurred in the mother flies. The two genes were shown to be 21.3 map units apart (refer to skeletal report). A male backcross is used to ensure that crossing over does not take place when it crossed to a pure-line unknown female. Glued-Stubble males were recovered from the F1 progeny, and they were crossed with U-7812 virgin females. Because of the way the genes are set up on the marker chromosome (refer to skeletal report), unknown mutations that are on chromosome 3 will never show up with Glued/Stubble (i.e. genes that are linked on chromosome 3 will not show up with Glued/Stubble). If the unknown mutation is on a different chromosome, then it is possible for the mutation to show up with Glued/Stubble. According to the data above, body color and eye color genes must be assorting independly from Glued/Stubble because the mutant forms of both genes show up with Glued/Stubble. On the other hand, mutant veination is never seen with Glued/Stubble, so wing veination must be on chromosome 3. The body color and eye color genes are therefore on chromosome 2 because they are neither sex-linked (which was found from Cross A) nor linked to chromosome 3. The data gathered (refer to skeletal report) shows that there is a linkage relationship between eye color and body color. If there had been no linkage, then the double-mutant, white eyes and dark body, would be expressed in the lowest quantity in the F2 progeny of crosses A, B, and I. This was not seen, as there were far more double-mutant flies than the recombinant orange or brown phenotypes. If the genes were not linked, then the expected ratio is 9:3:3:1. Using X2 analysis, it was supported that the two eye color genes are linked on autosome 2. The X2 value of 341.6 correlated to a probability of much less than 5% that the observed ratio would occur due to chance, given the expected ratio. This means the hypothesis of independent assortment must be rejected. This confirms that the eye color genes are linked on chromosome 2. With the combined data, it was found that the map distance between the eye colors was 18.9 map units. Performing a three-point cross established the map distances between the linked genes of eye color and body color. Refer to the skeletal report to see a table with data for the three-point cross. By dividing recombinant phenotypes by the total number of flies, the map distances between genes could be calculated. The calculations showed a 9.8 mu distance between body color and gene a, a 10.4 mu distance between the body color and the gene b, and 20.2 mu distance between gene a and gene b. Mapping of these genes to their assigned chromosomes was accomplished by acquiring the location of one of the genes. The other genes were then mapped in relation to that gene. The data presented above provides the organized conclusions of this experiment. It was shown that body color and eye color are linked on chromosome two, and that the wing venation trait was present on chromosome three.

BIO.G0.12.1,The Effect of Initial Carbon Dioxide Concentration on the Rate of Photosynthesis in the Aquatic Plant Elodea,Biology,Research Paper,"In the field of plant biology, one of the fundamental processes of life is photosynthesis. This process occurs through the fixation of carbon dioxide in the presence of water and may or may not require light (photosynthetic dark reactions can occur in the absence of light). The end result of photosynthesis is the production of organic materials, such as sugars and oxygen, which are necessary for the life processes of many organisms. Although the majority of plants carry out photosynthesis, they do so at different rates. The rate of photosynthesis is dependent upon several environmental factors, including temperature, amount of light present, amount of carbon dioxide present, and the color of the light. In this lab, the purpose was to manipulate one environmental factor to determine the effect on the process of photosynthesis. It was decided that the environmental factor to be tested would be the concentration of carbon dioxide initially present. Then a hypothesis was generated: An increase in the concentration of carbon dioxide initially present will lead to an increase in the rate of photosynthesis, and as a result, an increase in the amount of oxygen generated. Throughout the experiments, the aquatic plant Elodea was used to carry out photosynthesis. This particular plant is especially conducive to scientific experiments involving photosynthesis because of its ability to produce oxygen bubbles as it carries out photosynthesis, making it simple to monitor the rate of photosynthesis in an experiment. In this experiment, all other possible environmental factors, such as temperature, were kept constant, while the environmental factor to be tested was varied. To test the original hypothesis, different concentrations of sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3), a source of carbon dioxide, were used. Approximately three one inch sections of Elodea were cut with a razor blade. As the method of examining the rate of photosynthesis was counting the number of oxygen bubbles produced by the plants, special attention was paid to cutting the stem of the Elodea at an angle so that carbon dioxide bubbles could escape properly. Three graduated cylinders were each filled with 10 mL of solutions of 0.2% sodium bicarbonate, 0.1% sodium bicarbonate, and 0.0% sodium bicarbonate (pure water). These concentrations were accomplished by diluting a stock solution of 0.2% sodium bicarbonate with distilled water. All solutions used room temperature distilled water; therefore temperature was not a factor that was tested in this experiment. The three pieces were placed in the individual graduated cylinders. The number of bubbles that broke the surface of the water for each cylinder was counted during a five minute time period, and the results were recorded in a data chart. This was repeated for a total of five trials, with new pieces of Elodea being cut for each trial. During each of the trials, a bright lamp stationed approximately one foot away was aimed at the three cylinders to help stimulate the process of photosynthesis. For each of the five trials, the rate of photosynthesis was measured by counting the number of oxygen bubbles that was produced by the Elodea plant. Bubbles were counted as they traveled up the cylinder and broke the surface. Table 1 shows the data chart for the number of bubbles observed at each particular concentration of sodium bicarbonate in the five trials. Table 1. Number of Bubbles Observed for Increasing Concentrations of NaHCO3, a Source of Carbon Dioxide Afterwards, the average number of oxygen bubbles observed for each concentration of sodium bicarbonate was calculated. This data can be seen below in Table 2. It was observed that the rate of photosynthesis steadily increased as the initial concentration of sodium bicarbonate increased. Table 2. Average Number of O2 Bubbles Observed for Each Concentration of NaHCO3 As shown by the data in Tables 1 and 2 in the Results section, the number of oxygen bubbles generally increased as the initial concentration of sodium bicarbonate increased. Thus, one can conclude that the rate of photosynthesis is directly related to the concentration of sodium bicarbonate. The results seen in this experiment are therefore supportive of the original hypothesis presented in the introduction of the paper. Since sodium bicarbonate acts as a source of carbon dioxide, one of the required starting materials for the process of photosynthesis, it was expected that solution with more sodium bicarbonate, and this more starting carbon dioxide, would lead to the production of more oxygen compared to a solution that had no sodium bicarbonate in it. Comparing the results seen with 0.0% and 0.2% sodium bicarbonate solutions (Table 1 and 2), it is apparent that there is a much greater amount of oxygen produced with the addition of more carbon dioxide at the start of the experiment. The average number of bubbles for pure water is less than 1, while the average for 0.2% sodium bicarbonate is 10.8 bubbles. Based on the data shown in Table 1, it is evident that not every trial yielded ideal results. For instance, the results of Trial 2 show that the 0.2% sodium bicarbonate yielded 3 oxygen bubbles, an atypically low number for that particular concentration. Neither the 0.1% of the pure water solutions yielded any oxygen bubbles. There are several possible explanations for these results. As the rate of photosynthesis is measured by the amount of oxygen escaping in the form of bubbles from the stem of the Elodea plant, it is possible that there were problems with the stems of the plants. They may not have been cut at a sharp enough angle to allow the bubbles to escape, of they may have been blocked by some particles that were present in the plant. As the number of bubbles depends on the eyesight of individuals, it is also possible that human error is involved. Tiny bubbles of oxygen may have escaped the notice of the individuals performing the bubble counts. In relation to the question of how photosynthesis is affected by the initial amount of carbon dioxide present, it would be interesting to further explore how different concentrations of sodium bicarbonate can increase the rate of oxygen produced. In the experiments described in this paper, a stock solution of 0.2% sodium bicarbonate was used, so higher percentages of sodium bicarbonate could not be tested. Therefore, it would be useful to try percentages of sodium bicarbonate such as 0.5%, 0.75%, and 1.0%. Based on the results seen in this experiment, one would expect that increasing the percentage of sodium bicarbonate present would lead to an even greater increase in the rate of photosynthesis, and correspondingly, more oxygen bubbles produced. However, one would also expect that once the maximal rate of photosynthesis is reached, adding a higher concentration of sodium bicarbonate would not affect that rate of photosynthesis.

BIO.G0.14.1,Mapping of Unknown Mutations in Drosophila Melanogaster,Biology,Research Paper,"Drosophila Melanogaster, commonly known as fruit fly, was the organism studied in this experiment. Drosophila were ideal because they were small and had a life cycle of about 10 to 14 days. This allowed for many generations to be produced from crosses. Drosophila are diploid organisms that only have four pairs of chromosomes which includes three pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes. Drosophila were also ideal to study because they possess traits, which can be observed with a microscope, that were characteristic of the sex and genotype of the flies. In this experiment the pattern of heritance and the genetic loci of the mutations in body color, eye color, and wing venation in an unknown strain u4184 of flies. The unknown strain was crossed with a wild-type strain in a set of reciprocal crosses to determine if each trait was recessive or dominant and autosomal or sex-linked. The unknown strain was then crossed with three strains that each had different known marker mutations. The results from the F1 generation of these crosses and the results from their subsequent male backcrosses or F1 x F1 cross determined on which chromosomes the genes for body color, eye color, and wing venation were. The genetic distance between these genes was determined by the results in the F2 generation of the reciprocal crosses combined some of the results from the marker crosses by calculating the percentages of recombinants and parental types. During the first lab period, the traits of eye color, body color, and wing venation were observed in the unknown strain and wild-type strain using the microscope and CO2 according to the procedure described in the lab manual. The unknown flies had whit eyes, dark brown body color, and wing venation with short longitudinal veins. The wild-type flies of Ore-R had red eyes, tan body color, and wing venation with longitudinal veins that went to the end of the wing. During this time the differences between the female and male flies was determined. The male flies have rounder abdomens with the last two dorsal segments darkly pigmented, genital claspers ventrally on the abdomen, and sex combs on the first pair of legs. The female flies have pointier abdomens with dorsal triangular dark pigmentations and lack genital claspers and sex combs. After observing, two new cultures of unknown flies were made with about 15 females and 20 males each. The cultures bottle was placed on its side until the flies wake up so that they do not get caught in the food and die. These new cultures supplied a fresh source of unknown flies for later weeks during the experiment. Shortly after this, the adult flies in the eight unknown bottles and three wild-type bottles were cleared. Eight hours later 80 unknown virgin females and 20 wild type virgin females were collected as described in the lab manual on page 20. Clearing the adults and then waiting no more than eight hours to collect the females ensured that the females were virgins because they were not mature yet for mating with the males. The next step in the experiment was setting up the set of reciprocal crosses and the marker cross using the collected virgin females. The first cross was Reciprocal Cross A which consisted of 15 unknown U4184 virgin females and 10 wild type Ore-R males. To perform the crosses the same procedure was used as described in the lab manual for the culture, but in this case the flies were from two different strains instead of one strain. The vials for each cross were labeled for identification. The second cross was Reciprocal Cross B which consisted of 15 unknown U4184 males and 9 wild type, Ore-R females. The third cross performed was Marker Cross I, which consisted of 25 males from marker stock I and 10 unknown U4184 females. The marker I male flies had the genotype cv f on their only X chromosome, which produced a phenotype of cross veinless wings (with allele cv) and forked bristles (with allele f). These mutations are sex-linked, recessive. The fourth cross was Marker Cross II which consisted of 30 marker stock II males and 10 unknown U4184 virgin females. The marker stock II males had the phenotype of short thin bristles (with allele Bl), lobed eyes (with allele L), and curly wings (with allele Cy) and a genotype of Bl Bl+ L L+ Cy Cy+. The fifth cross was Marker Cross III and consisted of 30 marker stock III males and 10 unknown 4184 virgin females. The marker stock III males had a phenotype of smooth (glued) eyes (with allele Gl) and short, blunt bristles (with allele Sb) and a genotype of Gl Gl+ Sb Sb+ LVM LVM+. The LVM gene did not produce an effect on phenotype. One week later and once the vials all had a sufficient amount of pupae, the parents from all the crosses could be removed, killed with CO2, and disposed in the fly morgue. Because the fly life cycle is about 9 days, this step removes the parental generation and prevents breeding between the parental and F1 generation. During this time, the phenotypes of the marker crosses (which were noted above) were observed under the microscope so that offspring could be scored correctly. Also 40 unknown virgin females were collected according to the same procedure done before. The next step in the experiment was to score the F1 generation of all five crosses and make a record. The scoring took looked at the phenotypes for sex, body color, eye color, wing venation, and the marker mutations. At least 100 flies from Reciprocal Cross A, at least 100 from B, and at least 50 each from Marker Cross I, II, and III were scored. After scoring, the second round of crosses was set up. For Reciprocal Cross A 30- 40 male and female flies from the F1 generation were taken and put into a new bottle to make a F1 x F1 cross. This was done again to make a duplicate. The same was done for Reciprocal Cross B and Marker Cross I and their duplicates. For Marker Cross II, first a cross was made between 30 bristle, lobed males of its F1 and 10 unknown 4184 virgin females, and then a second cross was made between 30 curly males of the F1 and 10 unknown virgin females. For Marker Cross III, a cross of 30 glued, stubble makes from the F1 and 10 unknown virgin females was made and duplicated. These crosses for Marker Cross II and III are known as male back crosses. And one week later the adults were removed just as in the first round of crosses. Finally, the last step in the experiment was to score the F2 generation and the male back cross progeny according to their eye color, sex, body color, wing venation, and marker mutations. The results from the Reciprocal Crosses A and B in the F1 and F2 generations shed light o the genes controlling eye color, body color, and wing venation. The reciprocal crosses allowed for the determination of the traits as sex-linked or autosomal, and dominant or recessive. For example, if a trait were autosomal, then the progeny of both Cross A and B should be the same because it would not matter which parent had which genotype since each is passed on equally to both sexes of children. This is not true for a sex-linked trait, in which the son inherits the x chromosome and its genes only from the mother. These crosses F1 offspring also indicated whether the traits were dominant or recessive, because the offspring of these pure-breeding lines would show the dominant allele in their phenotype. The results for the F1 and F2 generations for the Reciprocal Crosses A and B are discussed individually below for body color, wing venation, and eye color. From Cross A F1, the dark body color gene can be determined as autosomal, recessive. It is recessive because all the F1 is wild-type. This indicates that the wild-type allele masks the mutant dark color allele. The trait is autosomal because both the males and females are wild-type. If the trait were sex-linked then the males would be mutant because they would only have one X chromosome which they inherited from their mutant mother from a pure-breeding line. The F1 from Cross B only indicated that dark body color trait was recessive because the males would be wild-type even if the trait were sex-linked since they would inherit a normal allele on the X chromosome from the mother. The results form the F2 generations of Crosses A and B determined if the dark body trait alleles were segregating properly. If this data were tabulated again to look at the ratios, the following would be observed: Upon Chi- Square analysis, the chi- square value was 4.38 with a p-value less than 0.05. This indicated to reject the hypothesis of light body color being completely dominant to dark with no more segregation the two alleles for body color. The rejection may have been because the dark body mutation does not have 100 % penetrance, or perhaps during scoring the newly hatched dark bodies were scored as light instead of dark. Based on the F1 results of cross A, the mutant wing venation can be determined as a recessive, autosomal trait based on the same reasoning used for the body color trait. The F1 results from Cross B only determined the trait as recessive, as it did for the dark body color gene. The F2 results determined if the alleles for the wing venation were segregating properly. Once the F2 results were combined and looked at in ratios, the hypothesis of normal segregation for a complete dominance of wild-type wing venation over the mutant could be tested. The following is the combined ratios: The chi-squared value for this test was .0176 with a p-value between .5 and .9. Thus, the hypothesis of complete penetrance and dominance of wild type wing venation over the mutant venation with no more segregation between the alleles cannot be rejected. To test if the alleles for wing venation and body color were independently assorting or if the genes were linked, the two traits have to be looked at together in the F2 results from the Crosses A and B combined. These numbers must then be made into ratios that can be compared to the expected ration for independent assortment. The ratio for independent assortment of the alleles for wing venation and body color must be derived from the obtained ratios, obtained earlier, of the segregation of the individual traits. The observed and expected ratios are tabulated below. Wt indicates wild-type, and m indicates mutant. The chi-squared value for testing the hypothesis of independent assortment was .628 with a p-value between .5 and .9. Thus, the hypothesis of independent assortment cannot be rejected. The genes for body color and wing venation were not linked. From the same reasoning used for the determination of body color and wing venation, the results from the F1 of cross A determined eye color as a autosomal, recessive trait, while Cross B F1 determined eye color as just a recessive trait. Looking at the F2 results for the eye color trait, however, made this trait a bite more complicated than the others. When observing the F2 of Crosses A and B, four eye colors were identified. There was red, white, and also brown and orange. Because there were four different eye colors, there could be two genes involved in the expression of eye color. Because there are two genes involved, the F2 results will determine the interaction between these two genes; the F2 results will conclude if the genes were linked or not. A hypothesis for the possible interaction is described by the following diagram: The presence of the a+ allele with the b+ allele complements to make the wild-type red eye color. However, brown was possible with the genotype of aab+_, orange was possible with the phenotype of a+_bb, and white was aabb. The data eye color from F2 of Crosses A and B is tabulated below. From just looking at this data it is reasonable to say that the two genes for eye color are linked because the number of number of white eye progeny (aabb) the double mutant offspring for the cross between two a+ab+b parents, is higher than the number of single mutant offspring (orange of brown eyes.) If the two genes were independently assorting, the double mutant of white eyes would be the least of the F2 progeny. A chi-square test with this data and the data from the F2 of Marker Cross I for the hypothesis of independent assortment gave a chi-squared value of 115.51 with a p-value <<< 0.05. Thus, the hypothesis was rejected. And the data above was used to find the map distance between the two eye color genes, a and b. The calculated map distance was 39.6 map units. The marker II and III stocks were balanced marker stocks to keep the heterozygous stocks pure line. The pure-line was established with a balanced lethal system, in which being homozygous for the mutant alleles was lethal. For example, flies in marker stock II had a one chromosome 2 carrying Bl L Cy+ and another chromosome 2 with Bl+ L+ Cy. These alleles are for the dominant, autosomal traits of short thin bristles, lobed eyes, and curly wings, respectively. When a male and female from marker stock II mate, the offspring with both chromosomes carrying Bl L Cy+ are killed and so are those both carrying the Bl+ L+ Cy chromosomes. Recombination among the genes in the chromosomes were controlled by inversion, an introduced cross-over suppressor for females, and males do not undergo recombination. This balanced marker system was also used in marker stock III with their chromosomes: one carrying Gl Sb LVM+ and the other carrying Gl+ Sb+ LVM. Marker Cross II and III used male backcrosses instead of F1xF1 crosses. In a male back cross, the male progeny from the F1 are selected and mated to certain homozygote genotype female (in this case an unknown virgin.) In Drosophilia, male flies do not under go recombination. By selecting the males form the F1 generation and using the homozygous unknown females, recombination should not occur. These crosses also used male back crosses so that all the offspring would be viable. This was true for the kind of backcrosses employed in this experiment because an unknown female was always used. The unknown female carried the wild-type alleles for the marker mutations and would pass them on to the offspring. So the male back cross offspring would never be homozygous for the lethal marker mutations. The back crosses conducted would indicate which genes were on the marker chromosomes 1, 2, and 3. If a certain mutation does not show up with a marker mutation in the male backcross progeny, then that mutation is linked with the marker mutation, and thus on the same chromosome. This is a result because no recombination should occur in a male backcross in Dosophilia. However, if the mutation does show up with the marker mutation in the back cross progeny then this would be a sign that the two mutations are not on the same chromosome. In this experiment Cross II did not produce any male back cross progeny, but the results for Cross III male progeny are below. The mutant body color of dark brown and mutant eye color of white showed up with the glued eye and stubble bristle marker mutations, and this means that neither the body color gene or eye color genes were on the third chromosome. However, the mutant wing venation of four short longitudinal veins did not show up with the glued eye and stubble bristle mutations, so the wing venation gene was on the third chromosome. The results from the F1 of Cross A determined that the eye color genes were autosomal. From Marker crosses II and III, the placement of gene for wing venation was found to be on chromosome 3, while body color was not. Since body color was not sex-linked, the gene for body color must be on chromosome 2 (since chromosome 4 does not carry many genes.) The same was true for the two eye color genes. Another clue that the eye color genes and body color gene are on the same allele was the fact that only 13 white eyed light body and 69 white eye dark body F2 progeny were observed for the crosses A, B, and I combined. This was very different from the expected results associated with independent assortment of about � of the white eye progeny to be light body and only � to be dark bodied. In a tree-point cross between d-a-b (d is allele for dark body, a and b are alleles for eye color), the distance between genes was found by doubling the number of recombinants because the F1 x F1 crosses hides half of the recombinants. The distance between d-b was found to be 10m.u, a-b was 39.5 m.u, and d-a was 49.5 after taking the twice the number of double crossovers into account. Thus, d and a were on the ends and b was in the middle. With the information from the five performed crosses and the information of the location of one mutation of the chromosomes given by the instructor, the genes for mutations for dark body color, mutant wing venation, and eye color may be mapped on the chromosomes of the Drosopholia .

BIO.G0.17.1,Effects of Protein Deficiency on Organ Size in Mus Musculus,Biology,Research Paper,"The amount of protein (standard animal chow and protein-deficient chow) accessible to mice was manipulated to determine if size of the pancreas, heart, and testes is affected by protein deficiency. Organs were harvested and measures of the organ mass/body mass, total protein, and DNA were determined and statistically tested for significance. In the no protein condition the pancreas mass/body mass ratio and pancreatic protein content were significantly lower than in control mice. In contrast, there were no statistically significant changes in organ mass/body mass ratio or protein content of the testes and heart during protein deficiency. Additionally, no significant differences were found in the amount of DNA in any of the three organs. The observation that total protein, but not total DNA, of the pancreas decreased during protein deficiency suggests that changes in cell size, and not cell number, are responsible for the decrease in pancreas weight during protein deficiency. Interestingly, the observation that testes size, DNA, and protein content are maintained indicates that in the face of the significant environmental stress of lack of dietary protein, reproductive capability is likely maintained with other vital life functions. Organisms are constantly altering their diets in response to food ability, competition, predation, and a multitude of other factors. How do organisms physiologically change in response to variations in diet? Which physiological processes are affected when an Alaskan brown bear switches from a low protein diet of wild berries and roots to a protein rich diet of salmon returning to spawn? Countless other examples exist in nature where organism experience annual, seasonal, and daily differences in food availability. The purpose of this study is to elucidate the effects of dietary protein deficiency on the size, and thus the function, of various organs in mice. The organ chosen for this study were the heart, pancreas, and testes, which play a crucial role in circulation, digestion, and reproduction. Adequate circulation is absolutely necessary for the transfer and removal of nutrients and wastes under any condition. Therefore, the prediction was made that regardless of dietary protein intake the mass (an indirect measure of organ function) of the heart would be maintained. In contrast, maintenance of the pancreas was expected to decrease during protein deficiency, since its major role in digesting dietary protein is non-essential under these conditions. The main focus of interest is the question of whether the mass of the testes of mice will be maintained when faced with protein deficiency. One could argue that reproduction is a non-essential life function and thus would be turned off when resources are in low supply. On the other hand, in terms of evolution the success of an organism is measured by its genetic contribution to the future. If environmental conditions appear unfavorable an organism may sacrifice its own health and biological needs in order to reproduce. A classic example of this occurs every year as salmon migrate upstream to their original riverbeds to spawn and soon after die. It is hypothesized that in mice facing protein deficiency mass of the testes will be maintained, since in nature mice have a rapid turnover rate and the success of the future generations may take priority over individual success. This issue can be more broadly applied to the field of ecology by observing how changes in diet effect organ growth. Prolonged periods of protein deficient diets may be a problem for organisms that inhabit temperate or artic regions where certain nutrient rich foods are not available throughout various time of the year. It is also interesting to infer the impact of diet on reproductive life histories. The 8 mice used in this experiment were on a 12/12 hour light/dark cycle and kept at room temperature during the duration of the study. 4 days prior to the tissue harvesting, � of the mice were randomly selected and were switched from the standard University of Michigan rodent chow (LabDiet; Richmond, VA) to a isocaloric, but protein deficient chow (Dyets; Bethlehem, PA) and were given free access to the chow until the completion of the study. At the completion of the study, the mice were killed using carbon dioxide and the target organs were harvested and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Measures of the body mass of the mice were taken before the harvesting of tissue and measures of the organ weight were taken prior to tissue homogenization to give the organ wt/ body wt ratios. Measures for total protein content in the organs was determined by homogenizing 100mg of tissue in 2ml of solution containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 5mM MgCl2 and immediately sonicated for 15secs to further disrupt the tissue. Following the sonication the total protein content was determined spectrophotometrically using BioRad protein dye. Measures of the total DNA content were measured using a luminescence spectrometer and a DNA quantification kit from Sigma-Aldritch. Equal amounts of protein were run on a SDS-PAGE (polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) and afterwards transferred to a nitrocellose membrane. The membrane was blotted with milk for 1 hr and rinsed to remove any non-specific binding. Subsequently, placed overnight into a solution containing antibodies for GAPDH or s6p (a ribosomal protein). The following day the membranes were rinsed and incubated with the secondary antibody for 1 hr, washed, and developed using enhanced chemoluminescence. Electronic images of the membranes were taken and used for comparison of control and protein deficient tissue. Data are expressed as means � standard deviation and were analyzed using a 2-tailed t test in the program SPSS. P values <0.05 were considered significant. In the pancreas the mean organ wt/ body wt ratio in the control condition was 7.51 � 0.62 (mg/g), whereas in the protein deficient mice the mean organ wt/ body wt ratio was 5.53 � 0.77 (mg/g) (Figure 1). Differences between the control and protein deficient mice were statistically significant and had a p-value of 0.007 (Table 1). In the heart the organ wt/ body wt ratios were 5.17 � 0.24 (mg/g) in the control condition and 5.33 � 0.31 (mg/g) (Figure 1). The heart wt/ body wt ratios in the control and protein deficient mice are very close and have a statistically insignificant p-value of 0.459 (Table 1). The ratios of organ wt/ body wt in the testes in the control and protein deficient mice were also statistically insignificant having a p-value of 0.572 (Table 1). In the control condition the organ wt/ body wt ratio was 6.57 � 1.23 (mg/g), whereas the protein deficient mice had a slight larger ratio of 7.13 � 1.41 (mg/g) (Figure 1). To gain insight into the types of changes protein deficient organs undergo measurements of the total DNA (a rough estimate of cell numbers) were taken to determine if protein deficient organs contained less total cells and/or equal number, but smaller cells. In the pancreas, the mean values for the control condition was 0.82 � 0.10 (mg/tissue) and the mean value in the protein deficient condition was .80 � 0.09 (mg/tissue) (Figure 2). The numbers are not statistically significant and have a p-value of 0.769 (Table 1). In the control condition of the heart a mean value of 0.26 � 0.08 (mg/tissue) was measured and a mean value of 0.22 � 0.05 (mg/tissue) was measured in the protein deficient mice (Figure 2). A statistically insignificant p-value of 0.404 was determined for the heart tissue (Table 1). The p-value of 0.637 determined in the testes was also statistically insignificant (Table 1). The measure of the DNA content in the control condition of the testes was found to be 0.51 � 0.12 (mg/tissue) and a similar average value of 0.55 � 0.09 (mg/tissue) was found in the protein deficient mice (Figure 2). In all three organs no significant change in DNA content was observed. Measurements of the total protein in the different organs yielded results similar to those found in the organ wt/ body wt ratios. In the control condition of the pancreas a mean value of 38.43 � 5.68 (mg/tissue) was observed and a mean value of 18.13 � 1.96 (mg/tissue) was observed in the protein deficient subjects (Figure 3). A significant p-value of 0.001 was found between the control and protein deficient conditions of the pancreas (Table 1). In the heart a mean value of 76.00 � 13.4 (mg/tissue) was measured in the control and a mean value of 68.63 � 4.30 (mg/tissue) was found in the protein deficient condition (Figure 3). The similar mean values in the heart lead to an insignificant p-value of 0.336 (Table 1). In the testes a difference between the control mean value of 65.60 � 20.94 (mg/tissue) and the protein deficient mean value of 45.85 � 9.19 (mg/tissue) was noticed, but a p-value of 0.135 failed to reject the null hypothesis (Figure 3, Table 1). In the immunoblot for the protein gapdh there are no clear differences in protein expression between the protein deficient and control mice (Figure 4). This is likely attributed to the fact that gapdh performs various housekeeping activities, and is thus conserved. In the immunoblot for the protein s6p, a ribosomal protein, it is clear that protein expression in the pancreas is less in protein deficient mice in comparison to the control mice (Figure 5). Much research has been done looking at the effects of nutritional stress on the body. For example, in a study on California voles it was observed that their choice of diet varied in breeding and non-breeding seasons. After giving the voles feed with differing nutrient content, it was inferred that nutrition plays an important role in reproduction (Batzli, 1986). Researchers hypothesized that various nutrients play a key role in an organism's reproductive success. The voles used in this experiment were fed either a diet consisting of grass seeds or a laboratory chow. The chow and seeds fed to the voles differed in concentrations of calcium and sodium, but not protein (Batzli, 1986). Voles fed the low calcium and sodium grass seeds reproduced less than voles fed a standard laboratory chow (Batzli, 1986). This experiment led to the belief that reproduction may be affected by an organism's diet. Another study looked at effects of nutritional stress on sperm production in moths. In the study, the sperm count of moths fed a low-protein diet was compared to the sperm count of moths fed a normal protein diet (Gage and Cook, 1994). The results indicated that diet played a significant role in spermatogenesis as lower sperm counts were found in moths fed a low protein diet. However, the size of the individual sperm cells was unaffected (Gage and Cook, 1994). My results that testes size was maintained during protein deficiency do not fit the findings of this study, but the difference in results may be due to the use of different organisms with different reproductive strategies. In the following study the relationship between survival and reproduction was looked at in zooplankton undergoing starvation. In the experiment it was found that in starvation conditions some species ceased reproduction and had higher survival rates, whereas some species maintained or increased energy allocation towards reproduction and had lower survival rates (Kirk, 1997). Furthermore, the results indicated that allocating energy production decreases resistance to starvation (Kirk, 1997). These findings suggest that if energy is devoted towards reproduction in times of low energy availability, individual fitness is decreased. However, if an organism fails to reproduce, genetically speaking, it makes no contribution to future generations. In species with a short life span like mice, individuals may die before environmental conditions become more favorable. This is why it was predicted that protein expression in testes would be maintained in mice fed a protein deficient diet. This study highlighted the fact that organisms possess different strategies for reproduction and determining whether reproduction will be maintained or decreased is dependent on the organism's life history. Yet another study examined the effects of dietary protein on rats. In the study, pregnant rats were either fed a standard laboratory chow or an equal calorie low protein chow. The offspring of the rats fed the low protein chow had a lower mean body weight than rats born from mothers who were fed a normal protein chow (Snoeck, 1990). These results led to the assumption that in protein deficient rats, proteins from various parts of the body were being broke down for use and thus, contributed to the lower body weight in the offspring of pregnant rats fed a low protein chow. These results were additionally supported as a lower mean mass of 29.8 (g) was observed in protein deficient mice, in comparison to the mean mass of 29.8 (g) in the control mice. Moreover, the effects of protein efficiency were observed in the protein synthesis in the livers of rats. The subjects used for research were either fed a standard laboratory chow or a low protein chow and the effects of protein deficiency were quantified by measuring the concentrations of mRNA in the rat livers (Pain, 1978). A significant decrease of mRNA concentrations was observed in the protein deficient mice (Pain, 1978). The fact that liver functioning decreased in this study led to the assumption that other organs would shrink in response to protein deficiency. In taking all the studies into consideration, protein deficiency causes lower mean body weights as proteins from organs are broken down in order to maintain vital life functioning. The prediction that regardless of dietary condition the functioning of the heart would be maintained was supported. In all the measurements used to infer organ function ability (organ wt/ body wt, total DNA and protein content) no significant differences were observed between the control and protein deficient subjects. This is more than likely attributed to the fact that functioning of an organism's heart is crucial for its survival. If the heart fails to work properly a myriad of problems exist as a result of poor circulation. Metabolic waste and byproducts of respiration must be maintained at low levels in the body, otherwise the ability of an organism to adequately function is severely jeopardized. Furthermore, cells through the body need a stead supply of nutrients (glucose, O2, hormones, etcetera) need to be circulated throughout the body, and thus, due to its importance in circulation it was predicted that heart function would be maintained. The results also clearly supported the prediction that functioning in the pancreas would decrease in protein deficient mice. A statistical difference was observed between the experimental and control mice in the organ wt/ body wt values and in the total protein content. This is more than likely due to the fact that one of the key roles of the pancreas is the digestion of protein and in the mice fed a no-protein diet digestion of protein was not necessary. If an organism is protein deficient, proteins within the body will be broken down in order to synthesize other proteins critical for survival. Interestingly, in the measures of total DNA content no statistical difference between the control and protein deficient mice was observed. Since DNA is localized in the nucleus of cells, measurements of the total DNA content of an organ gives a rough estimate into the number of cells. The similar means of total DNA in the pancreas and the rather large difference in total protein suggests that while the numbers of cells appear to be the same, the overall size of the cells seems to be decreasing in protein deficient mice. The hypothesis that reproduction would be maintained during protein deficiency was supported by the results. The argument that when faced with an environmental stress reproduction would be shut down until conditions improved, was not statistically supported. However, although not significant, a decrease in the total number of protein was observed in protein deficient mice. The standard deviation for the testes was extremely large due to the small sample size and having a larger sample size may have yielded significant differences. Despite the problems associated with sample size, the results indicated that reproduction is high on the hierarchy of biological functions. I would like to thank the Williams lab for graciously allowing me to use their materials, equipment, and laboratory space for my research. I would like to send a special thanks to Dr. Steven Crozier, who helped greatly throughout the entire process of my research.

BIO.G0.21.1,Prevalence of Haemosporidians in Birds of Northern Michigan,Biology,Research Paper,"In this study, the prevalence of Haemosporidians in birds of Northern Michigan was investigated with an emphasis on the parasite Plasmodium in passerine birds. Birds caught and banded by mist-netters were sampled for blood and recorded by species, net number, sex, age, and swab number. The total prevalence of blood parasites in the samples was 23.8%. Birds caught at the CEMA banding site had the highest prevalence of malarial infection, and the birds of the NOMA banding site had the lowest. Mann-Whitney Tests resulted in two-tailed p-values of 0.001, 0.762, and 0.003 for comparisons of prevalence between NOMA and CEMA, CEMA and SOMA, and NOMA and SOMA, respectively. Kruskal-Wallis Tests regarding bird age, location, and families resulted in p-values of 0.259, 0.004, and 0.009, respectively. Tests for sex showed no significant differences between prevalence of infection in male and female hosts. Parasites in nonhuman animals offer insight in understanding and treating human parasites, and are thus frequent subjects of scientific study. Avian species of malaria were the first models for studying the biology of the human Plasmodium (Slater 2005). In fact, they are so similar that for a long time, there was doubt as to whether the parasites of bird and human malaria were really different (Manwell 1935). Studies by Waters and colleagues (1993) showed that Plasmodium falciparum , the most deadly infective agent of human malaria, was more closely related to avian parasites than any other species. Not only are the causative agents similar, but the symptoms of human malaria are also similar to those of bird malarias (Kudo 1971). Previous studies have also attempted to compare the parasite-host relationship of avian and human malarias, plus evaluate the evolutionary dynamics of a system of many hosts and several multihost parasites (Gandon 2004). Co-evolution between the malaria parasite and its bird hosts have also been of interest. For example, studies of the Hawaiian Honeycreeper suggest that avian parasites do not hinder their hosts' reproductive success possibly because of evolution (Kilpatrick 2006). In addition, another Haemosporidian Leucocytozoon in ducks has been studied for its effects on brood size (O'Roke 1934). However, avian Plasmodium in Northern Michigan has not been studied in much depth. Its prevalence in the birds should be between 10 and 30% (Feldman et al. 1995). The current study attempted to examine the possibilities of a trend in the incidence of various species of Plasmodium in groupings of birds according to species, age, sex, or size. Furthermore, prevalence of blood parasites in passerine birds were compared to those found in Mergus merganser based on previous findings of Haematozoa in Michigan (DeJong et al., 2001). Data collection was carried out from July 10 to August 3, 2006 in Emmett County, Michigan. Birds were caught using mist nets, which were arranged in a loop formation with ten nets per loop. There were a total of three sites where birds were captured: NOMA (North Maple River), CEMA (Central Maple River), and SOMA (South Maple River). Data of every bird captured were recorded into organized data sheets, including information such as species name, age, sex, and net number. If blood was taken from a bird, the blood smear number was also recorded. A total of 189 blood samples were taken from a variety of birds; 159 of these were obtained through mist-netting, and the rest were obtained with help of Harvey Blankespoor. Blood samples were taken from birds' feet using sterile lancets, and then slides pre-cleaned with acid ethanol were held against the small droplet of blood. The blood collected on these slides was smeared with the edge of another slide, then fixed in methanol to be stained later in the lab. Each fixed slide was immersed in Coplin jars containing Giemsa stain for 15 seconds, placed in distilled water for 15 seconds, and finally, rinsed quickly in two more jars of fresh distilled water. Dried slides were viewed using the 100x power oil immersion lens. Observation of malaria within the blood cells was carried out by manually scanning the surface of the slide for five minutes (roughly 1000 red blood cells). Prevalence of infection was determined by dividing the number of infected passerine birds by the total number of passerine birds examined. Overall prevalence was determined by dividing the number of infected birds by the number of total birds examined. Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to calculate differences of the distribution of avian blood parasites and the intensity of infection between age, gender, and location of the species sampled. These helped to determine any relationship between age or gender and a particular infection and these analyses were done in SPSS 14.0 for Windows. The total prevalence of blood parasites in the samples was 23.8%. Table 1 summarizes the data of the 14 families of birds that were examined. The family Parulidae was most represented in the sample, but the Anatidae had the highest overall prevalence of infection and prevalence within the family. The family Parulidae also had the highest prevalence of infection within the mist-netted birds (Table 2, Figure 1). At species level, the Baltimore Oriole and Common Grackle had the highest prevalence of parasitic infection, then the Song Sparrow was next highest (Table 3, Figure 2). Most of the birds caught were in their hatch year age, which also had the highest prevalence excluding the group of five birds which were of unknown or indeterminate ages; no birds of the second year category were found to be infected (Figure 3). Birds caught at the CEMA banding site had the highest prevalence of malarial infection, and the birds of the NOMA banding site had the lowest (Figure 4). Mann-Whitney Tests resulted in two-tailed p-values of 0.001, 0.762, and 0.003 for comparisons of prevalence between NOMA and CEMA, CEMA and SOMA, and NOMA and SOMA, respectively (Tables 4, 5, and 6). Kruskal-Wallis Tests regarding bird age, location, and families resulted in p-values of 0.259, 0.004, and 0.009, respectively (Tables 7, 8 and 9). Tests for sex showed no significant differences between male and female. Table 1. Prevalence of parasitic infection Table 2.

Kruskal-Wallis Test by Family The data from this study show that prevalence of avian malaria in Northern Michigan was statistically significant. The prevalence of infection in all of the samples collected was 23.8% and the prevalence in only passerine birds was 10.7%, which supports previous research that blood smears demonstrate infection rates between 10 and 30% (Feldman et al. 1995). aemoproteus and Leucocytozoon are host-specific and are found within related species of a particular family (Fallis et al. 1974), but species of the genus Plasmodium are not as family-specific (Bennett et al. 1982). Results from the current study showed that Plasmodium was represented in five families. Birds of the family Anatidae had the highest prevalence of haemosporidian infection, but this is because of the ubiquitous nature of Leucocytozoon in that family of birds. The family Corvidae also had a high prevalence of 100%. Prevalence among species also varied dramatically. One factor that may explain the variance is habitat preference of infected bird species. Mosquitoes are found much more often near standing water, which suggests that birds nesting and breeding near standing water should be more susceptible to avian malaria. The Ovenbirds of the family Parulidae are common in all woods with dry floor; the Northern Waterthrushes are mainly in conifer bogs, wooden swamps, and along streams in heavily shaded ravines; the Black-and-White Warblers are common in conifer bogs; the Nashville Warblers are common in moist conifer woods and bogs or open, dry woods; the American Redstarts are common in deciduous woods. The Hermit Thrush of the family Turdidae are common in semi-open woods, and the Veeries are common in densely shaded, often moist woods. The White-throated Sparrows of the family Emberizidae are common in the shrubby edges of conifer bogs and heavily shaded coniferous-deciduous woods, and the Song Sparrows are common in brushy areas. Black-Capped Chickadees of the Paridae family are commonly found in wooded areas. The Baltimore Oriole of the family Icteridae is common at the edges of open deciduous woods, and the Common Grackle is common near lakes and streams, particularly where there are pines and other conifers. (Pettingill 1974). Overall, some of the infected bird species prefer habitats that are potentially mosquito-dense while others do not. There was a propensity for prevalence of infection to decrease with bird age except for birds in their second year (Figure 3). These data were inconsistent with previous findings which showed juveniles to be more susceptible to infection than adult birds (Atkinson and Van Riper 1991). Birds should be highly vulnerable to insect bites during the two weeks until they leave the nest because of their bare, feather-less skin, allowing an opportunity for them to be infected by Plasmodium. The small sample size of this study most likely limited the accuracy of the data; with a larger, more thorough sample, one would be able to better interpret the relationship of host age and haematozoan infection. Prevalence of infection was also high in the group of birds with unknown age, since only two out of only five birds were infected. The prevalence of infection at the three banding locations differed from one another, and was statistically significant. This could be a result of birds having varying degrees of exposure to the mosquito vector. Birds caught in mist nets near water should show a higher prevalence of infection than those caught elsewhere. Possibly, the CEMA and SOMA locations had more mosquito-rich areas in it, and as a result reflected a higher prevalence of bird malaria in the data. Tests for different prevalence in sex showed no significance, which is a result of inadequate data. Many of the birds caught in the mist nets could not be characterized for sex, because they were too young and juveniles are difficult to assess gender even with the expertise of collaborators of this project. Prevalence of Haemosporidian infection throughout the birds of Northern Michigan varied significantly by host family, species, age, and location. There are many possible factors that could contribute to this: bird behavior, habitat, concentration of mosquito vectors, climate, or co-evolution (Atkinson and Van Riper 1991). Further studies that look into this would be useful in comparison to distribution patterns of Plasmodium species that infect humans. No conclusions could be made about the effect of Haemosporidians on the bird populations of Northern Michigan, but continued pursuit of this question could supplement data and make more accurate analyses possible.

BIO.G0.22.1,Trunk Forking in Acer Saccharum: a Phototropic Response to Forest Canopy Gaps,Biology,Research Paper,"We examined trunk forking in Acer saccharumas an adaptation for filling canopy gaps. We measured diameter and distance to nearest neighbor around forked and unforked sugar maples and computed and compared the mean local basal area per sample area for these two groups. While these results were not statistically significant for each site, when taken together for all sites the data showed that sugar maples forked their trunks more often when the basal area around them was relatively low, indicating that forking allowed them to fill canopy gaps more effectively. Acer saccharum, the sugar maple, is a shade-tolerant, gap-phase species (Walters 1993). The growth of A. saccharum seedlings is typically restrained entirely by the limitation of light penetrating the forest floor by the canopies of overstory adult trees (Ricard et al., 2004). The seedlings persist on the forest floor as small juveniles for many years and grow quickly to fill gaps in the canopy created by disturbance (Marks and Gardescu 1998). The species has evolved phototropic responses to canopy gaps that allow it to avoid shade and quickly fill new gaps before its competitors (Brisson 2001). While in temperate North American forests A. saccharum is often found in conjunction with Fagus grandifolia (which is an even more shade-tolerant species), A. saccharum tends to out-compete F. grandifolia in the presence of very small canopy gaps by producing many short lateral branches that more effectively exploit these openings (Canham 1989). The relationships of several phenotypic responses to light gaps have been examined, including stem orientation (King 2001), leaf structure and biomass allocation (Osada et al., 2004), root architecture (Cheng et al., 2005), and lateral branching (Canham 1988). Though a recent study showed that trees, particularly shade-tolerant species, displace their canopies away from their neighbors to reduce competition and maximize resource exploitation (Muth and Bazzaz 2003), the tendency of sugar maples to branch early and form two trunks to fill the forest canopy more effectively has not been examined specifically. This experiment sought to demonstrate the effects of canopy density and light competition on the tendency of sugar maples to exhibit forked trunks. We hypothesized that trunk forking would allow sugar maples to fill canopy gaps more quickly and efficiently than a single trunk by creating a wider canopy area to absorb the light energy in these gaps and shade out nearby competitors. We expected that a forked trunk would be more effective than a single trunk at filling larger canopy gaps, while a single unforked trunk would be sufficient to fill smaller gaps. We tested our hypothesis by comparing local basal area per sample area around forked and unforked sugar maples from three sites that differed in species dominance and overall basal area. We predicted that each site would have significantly different proportions of forked and unforked trees and that mean local basal area per m2 would be significantly lower for forked trees than unforked trees. In addition we predicted that each site would have a significantly different mean local density for forked trees. We sampled three sites: Grapevine Point, Sedge Point and Colonial Point. We selected these sites because they had significant populations of sugar maples but varied in species composition and overall basal area. In each site we established a 50m by 50m test area. We sampled each test area with five parallel 2m by 50m transects. We established these transects within the test area at a distance of 10m from one another measured from their centers. We used the following parameters in the sampling: Within each transect we recorded the dbh and species of each tree. Every sugar maple encountered was recorded as being forked or not-forked, and we established a point-quarter system around the trees with one axis parallel to and the other perpendicular to the transect. Within each quarter we located the nearest neighbor and recorded its species, dbh and distance to the sugar maple. We repeated these methods identically for each of the three sites. We calculated the relative dominance and basal area of each site from the transect data. We calculated the mean local density and basal area around forked and unforked sugar maples from the point-quarter measurements separately for each site and for all the sugar maples sampled in the study. We used an ANOVA to analyze whether the mean local density for sugar maples differed between the three sites. We used a chi-square test to establish whether the proportion of forked and unforked sugar maples in the three sites was identically distributed to test the hypothesis that the sites would have significantly different proportions of forked and unforked trees. We used a t-test to examine whether the mean local density differed significantly for forked and unforked sugar maples for all the sites considered as a population. We examined this difference for the sites considered individually with additional t-tests. Colonial Point was dominated by relatively large trees and the understory was open with no light gaps and few recently fallen trees. The trees at Sedge Point tended to be much smaller and the understory was crowded with saplings of Acer and Fagus. The trees at Grapevine Point were intermediate in size and there were a few saplings rising to fill recently created light gaps. Because there was more distance between trees at Colonial Point and there were fewer trees overall, its basal area was almost equal to that of Grapevine Point. Though the trees were smallest on average at Sedge Point, this site had a substantially higher basal area than the other two because there were many more trees present (Table 1). Colonial Point was dominated by very large old beeches, and several smaller red maples and sugar maples were growing between them (Fig 1). Colonial Point had the lowest dominance of sugar maples of all the sites. Sedge Point had an almost equal balance of dominance by red maples, sugar maples and beeches (Fig 2). The beeches at Sedge Point tended to be smaller than the maples but there were more beeches overall. Grapevine Point was different from the other two sites in that over 50% of its basal area was accounted for by sugar maples. Unlike the other two sites, there were no adult beeches or red maples, and several large ashes and basswoods were present (Fig 3.) The difference in basal area per m2 around the sugar maples between the three sites was statistically significant with a p-value of 0.013, however only the difference between Sedge Point and Colonial Point was significant (Table 2). All of the sugar maples at Colonial Point were unforked, while 47% of the sugar maples at Sedge Point and 24% of the sugar maples at Grapevine Point were forked (Table 3). The difference between these proportions was statistically significant with a p-value of 0.03 (Table 4). Unforked sugar maples had an average local basal area per sample area of almost double that of the forked sugar maples (Table 5). This difference was statistically significant for the sugar maples of all three sites considered together, with a p-value of 0.007 (Table 6). This difference was statistically insignificant for Sedge Point (Table 7) and Grapevine Point (Table 8) considered individually, with p-values of 0.172 and 0.084, respectively. The results of the ANOVA (Table 2), which showed that the mean local basal area per m2 of all sugar maples was only significantly different between Sedge Point and Colonial Point, are in reality not very meaningful because all the sugar maples at Colonial Point were unforked. It would be more meaningful to compare the local basal area per m2 for all forked sugar maples or for all unforked sugar maples between the sites, however this would almost definitely be statistically insignificant because of the small sample sizes. The importance of this comparison is questionable because we would expect there to be variation in these numbers between sites based on differences in overall basal area in each site. In addition it would seem logical to compare the local basal areas per m2 of sugar maples with the overall basal areas per m2 at the sites, as lower values for the basal area around sugar maples would illustrate their preference for canopy gaps. However it would be unsound to make this comparison because we calculated basal area per m2 in the transects and around the sugar maples using different sampling methods. The use of different sampling methods can lead to drastically different estimated densities, particularly when distribution is non-uniform (Engeman et al. 1994). Because the canopy at Colonial Point was dominated by very tall, old trees that cast a thick uniform shade over the forest floor, it is not surprising that there were no forked sugar maples there. While it would seem unusual that the highest incidence of trunk forking occurred at Sedge Point (Table 3) where overall basal area was highest (Table 1), this site would also tend to have the most gaps because the trees in this site had lower basal areas and smaller canopies. This is supported by the fact that the difference between local basal area per m2 for forked and unforked sugar maples was higher for Sedge Point than Grapevine Point. Furthermore average local basal area per m2 for the unforked sugar maples at Colonial Point was close to the values for unforked trees at the other two sites (Table 5). If the study were repeated, photometer readings would be taken randomly at several points in each site. Though more light would not reach the forest floor on average, a higher value for standard deviation in these readings at Sedge Point would show that this site has more canopy gaps than the other two sites. Likewise we would expect that though the similar values for basal area at Grapevine Point and Colonial Point should lead to similar mean light intensities at ground level, a lower standard deviation at Colonial Point would reflect a uniformly shaded environment for maple seedlings. The fact that the difference between mean local basal areas per m2 was statistically significant for all sites considered together (Table 6) but insignificant for the sites considered individually (Tables 7 and 8), despite the fact that the means were almost identical for each site (Table 5), shows that the sample sizes were too small in this experiment. If the study were continued, doubling the sampling regime at each site would probably lead to statistically significant results. This would further establish the role of trunk forking as an evolutionary adaptation of Acer saccharumto quickly fill light gaps. Our study showed that trunk forking allowed sugar maples to fill large canopy gaps more completely. This was an original finding, however it was consistent with previous research. Shade-tolerant trees produce more lateral branches in canopy gaps (Canham 1989), and orient these branches towards areas with higher light (King 2001). Therefore in large canopy gaps trees tend to expand their canopies by producing several large radiating branches (Canham 1988). If two or more of the branches of a developing tree were highly successful in capturing light, it would be logical for them to continue to develop upwards towards different areas of the light gap and eventually form distinct trunks with individual canopies. The leaves of these canopies would detect light competition by means of the red to far-red irradiance ratio (Aphalo et. al 1999) and the branches of the tree would behave autonomously and avoid one another (Brisson 2001). At this point the canopy of one trunk would respond to shading by the canopy of its other trunks exactly as it would to shading from neighboring trees (Muth and Bazzaz 2003), and orient its trunks away from each other and neighboring trees to minimize the interaction between canopies. As long as the individual canopies were successful in capturing light, all the trunks would be maintained with their canopies oriented away from each other to minimize competition and exploit all available light. Further support for our results could be provided by long-term studies in which the development of sugar maples is observed over time. Sugar maples would be grown under experimentally created canopy gaps with known values of canopy closure, and the incidence of forking could be observed to determine a threshold gap size under which forking is induced. Based on our observations we would expect that the threshold local basal area per sample area needed to induce forking would be somewhere between 0.00222 and 0.00408, however the experiment outlined above would give a threshold value for canopy closure which would be more relevant because this value more accurately represents the light environment in the microhabitat of a seedling (Jennings et al. 1999). It is interesting to note that we observed several sugar maples which had trunks that forked, but one or more of the trunks was dead and rotting. The dead trunks always pointed into the canopy of a tall nearby tree. This suggested that the dead trunks had been aborted because their leaves were not receiving enough sunlight because they were being shaded out by a taller neighbor. A long-term study, perhaps performed as a follow-up to the one described above, could be performed to observe this process and determine that in fact the trunks die in response to their gaps being filled by surrounding taller trees, and not the other way around. This would be done by blocking sunlight to one of the trunks of several forked sugar maples and seeing whether the trees abort entire trunks in the same way that they abort unproductive smaller branches. Trunk forking is an adaptation that has evolved in certain canopy gap-dependent species that improves their competitiveness and overall evolutionary fitness. Tree species with the ability to alter their form in response to their light conditions have an advantage and will tend to outcompete those that are morphologically rigid in settings where environmental heterogeneity is high. An improved insight into trunk forking as a response to light gaps will increase understanding of forest succession and tree species' adaptations to varying conditions. Table 1.

BIO.G0.23.1,Drosophila Melanogaster lab report,Biology,Research Paper,"Closer examination of unknown Drosophila Melanogaster strain U3833 results in the observation of 3 mutant phenotypes. These observed mutations were white eyes, dark body, and mutant wing venation. Mutant wing venation resulted in certain longitudinal veins not fully traversing the wings. Variance in the expression of this mutation was also noted as the degree to which the individual vein was shortened varied. The dark body mutations was characterized with the body of the fly consisting of a black hue, while the eye color mutation was initially exemplified by white eyes, however, in the F2 generation both orange and brown became additionally evident. The location of these mutations was determined experimentally through the use of marker crosses and F1 backcrosses between F1 virgin females and unknown males. From these it was determined that the gene for body color was located on the third chromosome, while the gene for wing venation was on the second chromosome along with those controlling eye color. The mode of inheritance for eye color was determined from the F2 generation of cross A and B and I, which resulted in two additional phenotypes being observed. This corresponded to two genes controlling the expression of eye color. Furthermore, these genes were linked, as there is not a 9:3:3:1 ratio demonstrative of independently assorting genes in regards to eye color within these progeny. Between these two recessive genes homozygous b resulted in orange eyes and homozygous a resulted in brown eyes, while a fly homozygous for both genes expressed white eyes. Additionally, homozygous w resulted in mutant wing venation and homozygous d resulted in dark body both of which are recessive to the wild type allele. In regards to segregation, body color and wing venation consist of one gene and assort independently with a ratio of 9.7: 2.6: 2.1: 1. The recessive nature of each trait can be observed from the fact that all F1 progeny do not exhibit mutant phenotypes. Along with this, all mutations are autosomal as seen by the fact that in F1 progeny of cross A, no male fly exhibits mutant phenotypes. Figure 1: Proposed chromosome maps There are many reasons by which Drosophila Melanogaster is a model experimental model for genetic study. The first of which deals directly with the life cycle of this small insect. Only lasting 9 days, new generations are able to be generated quickly and coincide well with the timing of MCDB 306 class. Furthermore, as female flies can lay as many as 500 eggs in 10 days, the necessary population size for genetic analysis can be created and maintained. Another very important facet of Drosophila Melanogaster is the fact that upon emergence from pupa the female does not reach sexual maturity until approximately eight hours. This allows for the collection of virgin females for further crosses. There are also significant genetic advantages in using D. Melanogaster as well. Foremost is the fact that male flies do not undergo recombination and thus drastically reduce the complexity of scoring future generations. Additionally, the fact that this type of fly only has four chromosomes is also helpful in decreasing the number of chromosomal marker crosses. The intent of this experiment was to identify the correct chromosome, locus, and mode of inheritance for three unique mutations through the use of designed crosses and statistical analysis. Given the dramatic increase in genetic study, experience in locating unknown mutations within a genome can be very helpful in real world laboratories. This understanding was obtained via careful adherence to established laboratory protocol. The isolation of virgin females and the ability to produce viable crosses with the selected flies was a vital piece in the overall goal of establishing a chromosomal map of unknown mutations. This could be determined only after performing a series of specific genetic crosses between precise populations of D. Melanogaster. Cross A and B were designed to determine if the mutations were dominant or recessive, while cross A showed if the mutation was autosomal or sex linked. For the crosses designated as marker, after executing the initial parental and F1 crosses, F1 backcrosses were performed with flies originating from specific marker populations exhibiting mutations with known loci. As each marker cross utilized populations of flies with different known mutations as well as cross over suppressing inversions, using the principles of independent assortment, though the observation of the progeny from these crosses, allows for the determination of the correct chromosome. A mutation's location on a chromosome can be obtained by statistical analysis of three point crossovers of three mutant traits. With exception to a few altered details the overlaying procedure for this lab is described in depth in the MCDB 306 Lab Manual. The major difference is that due poor viability, the marker 2 cross was not performed. As a result only four crosses were performed. Virgin females were used when necessary in order to have a controlled cross as the female cannot have already been fertilized by a male prior to the initiation of a new cross. The crosses performed are outlined in the chart below. Additionally in preparation of the marker one and three backcross an initial cross of unknown virgin females and the respective maker males was performed. Table 1: Cross summary Table 2: Cross A and B organized data From the F1 results noted above several conclusions can be drawn from the analysis of the progeny from both cross A and B. As in both crosses no mutant phenotypes were observed, one could determine that the mutation for dark body is in fact recessive. Furthermore, from cross A one is able to determine that this same mutation is autosomal. This is due to the fact that, were the mutation for body color located on the X chromosome, all male flies would receive only the mutant allele from their mothers, as the female in the cross is homozygous for the mutation. This cannot be determined from the B cross as the females in this cross will always provide an allele with a wild type gamete. From the F2 results noted above, it was determined that the mutation for body color undergoes normal Mendelian segregation and consists of only one gene. This was determined by the analyzation of the ratios of wild type to mutant flies. The observed ratio as noted in the skeletal appendix was 3.35:1. With this ratio being close to the typical Mendelian ratio of 3:1 a chi squared test was performed in order to make sure the hypothesis of normal segregation is not to be rejected. Obtaining a X2 value of 1.18 with a degree of freedom of one and a probability greater than 0.05, it was clear that one would fail to reject the hypothesis of normal segregation. From the F1 data noted above it is clear that like body color, wing venation is also a recessive mutation found on an autosome. This can be supported by the fact that both the F1 progeny of cross A and B resulted in exclusively wild type flies being justified in a fashion similar to body color. Furthermore, similar to body color, one can conclude that the mutation is autosomal as all male progeny of Cross A were wild type for wing venation. From the F2 results noted above, similarly to body color, it was hypothesized that this mutation undergoes normal segregation in a Mendelian fashion. Despite this, the observed ratio of wild type to mutant flies however was four to one compared to the expected ratio of three to one for normal single gene inheritance. Upon obtaining a X2 value of 7.67 (degree of freedom 1) and a probability less than 0.05 the hypothesis cannot be accepted. Despite this, it is possible that due to the variance in expressivity of the wing venation mutation a counting error may have occurred, thus accounting for the rejection of the hypothesis. Table 3: Expected and observed ratios for wing and body mutation In consideration of the relative location both wing venation and body color, as well as whether or not these mutations assort independently or are linked, it is necessary to analyze the phenotypic ratios. As shown above, the observed phenotypic ratio was 9.7 : 2.6 : 2.1 : 1, while the expected ratio of 13.43 : 4 : 3.35 : 1 was derived from the individual observed phenotypic ratio of each separate mutation. Having an initial hypothesis of independent assortment for each gene, a X2 test was performed. The obtained value was 6.13 and with a corresponding probability of greater than 0.05 (three degrees of freedom) one would fail to reject the hypothesis. Therefore, one can assume the two individual mutations are not linked and undergo independent assortment in a Mendelian fashion. Table 4: Combined Data From the F1 data obtained from the A and B crosses it was once again possible to establish that eye color was recessive and autosomal. This is due to the fact that in both cross A and B there were no mutant flies observed, illustrating once again the same pattern seen in the previous mutations of being recessive. Furthermore, from cross A it is possible to again determine that as there are no males exhibiting the mutant eye color the mutant phenotype is not on the X chromosome for the previously stated reasons. From the F2 results it becomes clear that due to the presence of more than two phenotypes, there must be multi gene control over eye color. In the F2 generation eye color was not limited to red and white, but rather orange and brown became evident among progeny. With a hypothesized genotypic and phenotypic relationship seen below. Table 5: Proposed eye color genotypes and phenotypes Table 6: Final eye color observation From analyzation of the obtained data a hypothesis of two linked genes was proposed. One can justify the linkage, as were the two alleles for eye color assorting independently a ratio of 9:3:3:1 would be observed in actuality however, a ratio of 5.98: 1: 1.2: 1 for red: white: brown: orange. Were independent assortment occurring the ratio of orange and brown would be expected to be significantly larger than that of white. Given that they are linked the map distance between the two alleles was determined to be 48.1 mu. The male backcross allows for the determination of whether or not a mutation is located on a certain chromosome. One is first required to perform a cross between a virgin mutant female and a male from an individual marker stock. The male progeny from this cross are then mated with unknown virgin females. Upon examination of the progeny from this cross, one can conclude that if the mutation in question can be observed with the marker mutations, then due to the principles of independent assortment the unknown mutation cannot be on the same chromosome as the marker mutations. Consequently if the unknown mutation is not observed with the marker mutations then one can assume that the mutation is on the same chromosome. Due to the low viability of marker stock II it was required that data for this cross be extrapolated from results throughout the lab. Table 7: Cross III F1 male backcross Table 8: Cross II F1 male backcross From the given data, as the mutation for body color is not observed with the glued stubble marker for chromosome three, it can be concluded that this gene is on the third chromosome. Analyzation of the extrapolated data of marker cross two shows that both wing mutation and eye color are not observed with the maker mutations of Bristle Lobed or Curly. This can be determined since previous data concluded that these mutations are not sex-linked. Also from the data obtained from marker cross III it is clear that these mutations are not on chromosome three as they are observed with the marker mutations. Finally, chromosome four is eliminated as a possibility as it was stated that no unknown mutations were located on chromosome four. Table 9: Three point cross observed frequencies Through the use of the previous marker crosses, it is clear that the two genes along with wing venation were on chromosome two. Due to the linked nature of the eye color genes and wing venation, one can use the frequency of single and double crossovers to determine the order and map distance of the genes in question. As seen calculated in the skeletal report appendix, the map distance between wing venation and mutant gene a was 89.9 mu. The distance between wing venation and b was 41.9 mu and the distance from gene a to gene b was 48 mu. Therefore the final gene order on chromosome two would be wing venation at 3.8 mu gene b at 45.7 mu and gene a at 93.7 mu. The final assignments of each unknown mutation is as follows Table 10: Final mutation summary From cross A it was determined that each mutation was in fact autosomal. This was due to the fact that as the female in the cross was homozygous for each displayed mutant phenotype, were any of the mutant genes on the X chromosome, all male progeny would receive only the mutant gene and consequently express the mutant phenotype. As this was not the case, it is clear that each mutation was autosomal. From both cross A and B it was clear that as all F1 progeny were wild type, each mutation was recessive. From the F2 progeny of crosses A and B it was also made clear that body color was controlled by one gene and sorted independently. Wing venation, although controlled by one gene assorting independently from body color received a chi squared value that corresponded to a probability of less than 0.05 consequently rejecting the hypothesis of normal segregation. This error is most likely attributed to a counting error resulting from the varying expression of mutant wing venation. Marker Cross I, as it was already determined that no mutations were sex linked, instead was used to determine, along with cross A and B the mode of inheritance for eye color as well as the linkage between the two genes controlling eye color. From this information it was determined that eye color was controlled by two genes were only when both were homozygous were white eyes observed, when either gene a or b was homozygous the eyes were brown or orange respectively. Marker backcross III provides evidence regarding the chromosomal location of the dark body mutation, as it was not observed with the marker mutations in any progeny. Through extrapolation it was determined that both wing mutation and the two genes for eye color were located on chromosome two.

BIO.G0.27.1,Small Mammal Response to Post-fire Forest Succession in Northern Lower Michigan,Biology,Research Paper,"Fire can drastically alter forest ecosystems, and this can have important impacts on small mammal abundance, demography and community composition. Forest fire reduces the vertical structure of a habitat and changes the vegetative composition and coverage, leading to a reduction in moisture and greater temperature extremes. These effects can be mediated by the presence of coarse woody debris. We selected a chronosequence of naturally and experimentally burned plots at the University of Michigan Biological Station (Michigan, USA) to investigate the relationships between post-fire succession and small mammal communities. We used vegetation/CWD surveys and 3 consecutive nights of live-trapping to characterize five plots covering a range of time since last burn (1917-1998). The percent of Populus grandidentata in a plot decreased with age while Pinus spp. and Quercus rubra increased in abundance with time since burning. We captured 3 species (Peromyscus leucopus,, Tamias striatus, Blarina brevicauda), and observed significant differences between plots in the abundance, age structure and reproductive condition of P. leucopus. The presence of reproducing adults was significantly positively correlated (P=0.037) with the presence of coarse woody debris. The high percentage of generally non-reproducing subadults in the intermediate plots may indicate a source-sink scenario, but the measured habitat variables were not sufficient to explain inconsistencies. Michigan forests have experienced fire as a result of natural causes, Native American agriculture and intense logging in the 1800s (Burt Barnes pers. comm.). After 80 years of fire exclusion, land managers have reintroduced fire in the form of prescribed burning in an effort to maintain fire-adapted ecosystems and combat invasive species (http://www.michigan.gov/dnr/0,1607,7-153-10370_12148_25071-70073--,00.html). It is important to understand the impact of fire on small mammal populations and communities because these animals (Muridae, Soricidae) play a variety of important roles in forest ecosystems, such as feeding on invertebrates, seeds, fruit, and lichen, disseminating seeds and mycorrhizal fungi, and serving as prey for a number of avian and mammalian predators (Carey and Johnson 1995). Clearcutting and burning can drastically alter ecosystems, with the most severe fires burning much of the vegetative cover and soil organic matter. Because recently burned ecosystems lack dense cover, they tend to experience higher maximum and lower minimum temperatures than older stands, which can make the habitat unattractive to sensitive mammals (Kozlowski and Ahlgren 1974). The presence of downed woody material, which provides cover, moist microenvironments, runways, burrow sites and a substrate for food, leads to higher recolonization rates for rodents and insectivores during the first 10 years after burning (Fisher and Wilkinson 2005). Additionally, the redevelopment of vegetation structure is associated with the reappearance of small mammal species (Whelan 1995). Some mammals may utilize the edge of plots because they prefer to exploit multiple habitats (Kozlowski and Ahlgren 1974). Post-fire forest succession influences small mammal population and community composition. Species richness of small mammals increases over time, but levels-off after the first 30-40 years (Whelan 1995). In early successional habitats, the lack of complex/layered vegetation may result in interspecific competition that was not present before the fire, leading to reduced numbers of all species and a change in dominance (Kozlowski and Ahlgren 1974). A source-sink scenario has been observed in some low-quality habitats created by fire, with more recently burned areas being dominated by non-reproducing individuals (Ecke et al. 2002; Buech et al. 1977 in Fisher and Wilkinson 2005). We selected a chronosequence of naturally and experimentally burned plots at the University of Michigan Biological Station (UMBS) to investigate the relationships between post-fire succession and small mammal communities. Through live-trapping, we looked for changes in the abundance, diversity and community composition of small mammal species across the burn sequence. Additionally, we measured the age structure and reproductive status of individuals within each plot to look for the existence of a source-sink scenario. We also surveyed the vegetative cover and coarse woody debris (CWD) in each plot, which can be more important than the age since burn (Simon et al. 1998), so as to provide a mechanistic explanation for any observed differences in small mammal composition. Our study was conducted on a chronosequence of experimental and natural burn plots (see Fig. 1) located on UMBS property (Section 32, T37N, R3W; Cheboygan Co., northern lower Michigan). We chose five plots about 1 hectare in size - one from 1917 that burned naturally and four experimental burns (1936, 1954, 1980, 1998). All experimental burn plots were clear-cut, with the poor-quality timber and slash left on-site and burned. The 1998 burn also includes a deer exclosure and has undergone yearly aspen ramet clipping in some portions. The entire burn sequence is located on a high-elevation outwash plain characterized by excessively-drained, acidic, sandy soil. Pre-settlement, the area was an eastern white pine- red pine - eastern hemlock - northern red oak forest, but extensive logging and 40 years of frequent fires resulted in the dominance of Bigtooth aspen (Populus grandidentata) in early successional forests, and it maintains a noticeable presence in older forests as well (White 2000). Figure 1. The 1998 Burn included a 50x80 deer exclosure. The 1917 plot was located to the south of the 1948 plot and to the west of the 1954 plot We used a point-centered quarter sampling method (Anderson 2006) to survey canopy and subcanopy trees in each plot. Four transects 50m long and at least 10m apart, with 10m between point trees, were laid on each plot. From each point tree, we recorded the diameter, distance from point tree and species of one canopy and one subcanopy tree encountered in each NW, NE, SW and SE direction. Coarse woody debris (CWD) was surveyed along 4 transects in each burn plot. Transects were 50m long and at least 10m apart. We counted any piece of downed woody material greater than 3cm in diameter that crossed a transect and noted its size category: 3-10cm and >10cm. Trapping grids were set-up on each plot. For plots 1917-1980, trap lines were laid every 10m until reaching the edge of the plot, and folding Sherman live-traps (22.9 � 7.6 � 8.9 cm; H. B. Sherman Trap Co., Tallahassee, Florida, USA) were placed every 10m along the lines until reaching the plot border. We used the same procedure in the 1998 plot except no traps were laid in a 50x80 restricted area in the middle of the plot and some trap lines had portions located within the deer exclosure fence. The 1917 plot was 100x100m with 121 traps, the 1936 and 1954 plots were 70x80m with 72 traps, 1980 plot was 60x100m with 77traps, and the 1998 plot, excluding the restricted portion, was 5000 m2 with 69 traps. Trapping was conducted for three consecutive nights starting 24 July 2006. Traps were laid out after 7pm the first night and loaded with oats. Each morning after 7:30am, traps with animals in them were removed during the day for processing, and empty traps were closed. We also noted the number of closed but empty, disturbed or missing traps in order to monitor the level of predator interference. For each captured animal, we recorded the species, gender, reproductive status and weight. Additionally, a small portion of fur was clipped from a position on the back corresponding to one of the 5 plots, allowing us to determine if the animal was a recapture in the following days. Peromyscus and Tamias species were given oats and apples during the day, and Blarina were given worms. After 7:30pm, processed animals were returned to their trapping station, and all traps were re-set and loaded with oats. All statistical tests were performed using SPSS 14.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA). Statistical comparisons were either a Chi-square test or a Spearmann Rank Correlation with a significance level of P d 0.05. The data collected on recaptured animals was not included in the analysis. The following species were encountered during our point-centered quarter sampling of the plots: Bigtooth aspen (Populus grandidentata), Northern red oak (Quercus rubra), Red maple (Acer rubrum ), Eastern white pine (Pinus strobus), Red pine (Pinus resinosa), Paper birch (Betula papyrifera) and Amelanchier spp. Populus grandidentata was the most commonly encountered canopy and subcanopy tree overall, but its relative dominance varied between the burn plots, with plots 1917 and 1936 having the highest percentages of other species (see Fig. 2). The total basal area increases with age of plot (see Fig. 3), reflecting the larger size of canopy and subcanopy trees in the oldest plots. The percent coverage by the most abundant tree species correlated well with the year of the burning in the plots. The percentage of P. grandidentata in a plot was significantly positively correlated with the year of the plot (Rs=0.9, P=0.037). Both the percent composition of Pinus spp. and Q. rubra were negatively correlated with the year of the plot (Rs=-1, P=0.000; Rs=-0.8, P=0.104). Acer rubrum also generally increased (Rs=0.7, P=0.188) with the year of the plot. The amount of coarse woody debris >3cm in diameter differed significantly between plots (�2 = 13.53, d.f. = 4, P<0.01), with plots 1917 and 1998 having the most CWD (see Fig. 4). We captured a total of 136 individuals (not including recaptures) and 3 different species. Peromyscus leucopus (n=118) was the most abundant. We also captured a few Tamias striatus (n=15) and Blarina brevicauda (n=5; may include recapture). On average, 49% of all captures on the 2nd and 3rd days were recaptures. All P. leucopus recaptured had been captured earlier in the same plot, except in the 1917 plot, where P. leucopus males were recaptured from the 1980 and 1954 plots as well. One Tamias captured in the 1980 plot was recaptured from the 1998 plot, but all other Tamias were recaptured in the same plot as their first capture. The majority of all recaptured individuals (77%) were non-reproducing (abdominal males or nipples tiny females), and this majority held for each plot. In total, 154 traps were disturbed (see Table 1 for percent disturbed by plot), with the most likely predators being Procyon lotor, Canis latrans and Martes americana. One M. Americana may have been sighted in the 1917 plot on the 2nd day of trapping. Plots 1936 and 1954 were severely disturbed on the 3rd day of trapping, with 31% and 42% of traps disturbed, respectively. Canis lantrans may have been responsible for disturbing the 1954 trap lines on the 3rd day. In order to make comparisons across plots, we adjusted the number of individuals captured according to the following formula, which puts all of the numbers in terms of 121 traps and accounts for the effect of predator disturbance: Adjusted # = ((Total # individuals caught)*(3*121))/ ((3*#of traps in plot)-(total #traps disturbed)) The abundance of P. leucopus was significantly different between plots (�2 = 16.85, d.f. = 4, P<0.005), with noticeably fewer mice than expected in the 1954 and 1980 plots and more than expected found in the 1936 and 1998 plots (see Table 2). There was no significant variation across plots in the number of males and females (�2 = 6.69, d.f. = 4, P<0.25), even though we often caught more males than females, especially in the 1980 plot. The age structure of P. leucopus also varied significantly across burn treatments (�2 = 20.2, d.f. = 8, P<0.01). There were more adults and fewer juveniles than expected in the 1917 plot, fewer adults and more subadults in the 1936 and 1954 plots and more juveniles and fewer subadults in the 1998 plot (see Fig. 5). While the distribution of weight classes did not vary significantly across plots (�2 = 15.21, d.f. = 4, 0.05<P<0.075), they did roughly reflect the trends in the age data. There was a smaller percentage of P. leucopus in the 15.1-20g category (roughly subadult) for the 1998 plot, a larger percentage of >20.1g P. leucopus (roughly adult) in the 1998 plot than expected, and more P. leucopus in the 15.1-20g category than expected for the 1936 plot. We also found variation across plots in the reproductive status of P. leucopus. There was a significant difference in the percent of scrotal versus the percent of abdominal males (�2 = 11.32, d.f. = 4, P<0.025) and in the percent of females with tiny nipples versus those with enlarged nipples (�2 = 11.19, d.f. = 4, P<0.025). The 1936 plot had many more females with tiny nipples and more abdominal males than expected. The 1917 plot had more females with enlarged nipples than expected, and the 1980 plot had more abdominal males than expected. Figure 6 demonstrates that non-reproductive males and females tended to be in the same plot and visa versa. The highest numbers of reproductive individuals (reproductive adults and subadults combine d) were found in the 1917 and 1998 plots. Spearmann-Rank Correlations indicated a relationship between CWD and reproductive status of P. leucopus. The amount of CWD >3cm in each plot was significantly negatively correlated with the percent of abdominal males in a plot (Rs=-0.9, P=0.037) and was also somewhat positively correlated with the percent of scrotal males (Rs=0.7, P=0.188). There may also be a slight correlation between CWD and the reproductive status of female mice, with non-reproductive individuals in the plots with less CWD (percent nipples tiny: Rs=-0.6, P=0.285; percent nipples enlarged: Rs=0.6, P=0.285). The burn chronosequence exhibited a progressive change in habitat, with the number of years since burning being highly correlated with the canopy and subcanopy composition of the forest community. The percent of P. grandidentata in a plot decreased with age while Pinus spp. and Q. rubra increased in abundance with time since burning. Because we only captured 3 different species (P. leucopus, T. striatus, B. brevicauda), we were not able to conduct a rigorous investigation of changes in species diversity. However, we did observe significant differences between plots in the abundance, age structure and reproductive condition of P. leucopus. In general, there were more subadults in the intermediate-age plots, more adults in the oldest plot and more juveniles in the most recently burned plot than expected. Overall, there was a higher percentage of reproductive females in the 1917 plot, a higher percentage of non-reproducing P. leucopus in the intermediate plots and no deviation from the expected values for the youngest plot. The most coarse woody debris and the highest number of reproductive individuals were found in the 1917 and 1998 plots. This pattern is supported by the significant correlation of high levels of CWD with the presence of scrotal males. Further research should investigate the extent to which P. leucopus utilize CWD for nest-sites, runways, foraging, etc. in the burn plots. Casual observation indicated that several burrows were located near CWD and that large numbers of insects, a preferred food for P. leucopus (Wolff et al. 1985), were present beneath the debris in the 1998 plot . We were not able to confirm the existence of a source-sink scenario occurring in the intermediately aged plots. However, the high percentage of subadults (the age for emigration) paired with the low overall P. leucopus abundance and dearth of high quality food sources (few oaks, pines and CWD), makes this a plausible explanation for some of the variation between plots. However, caution must be taken when determining what sort of habitat is acceptable for P. leucopus since they are capable of living at high densities across a wide-variety of habitats (Lackey 1978), and they are flexible in their food preferences (Drickamer 1976). Additional research should incorporate a ground cover survey in order to account for the presence and quality of fruiting shrubs, since these could comprise a major part of the diet of P. leucopus during certain parts of the year. The 1998 plot may have been a more suitable habitat than originally expected (supporting high numbers of adults) due to the large amount of coarse woody debris, which has the potential to provide food/foraging habitat, thermal regulation and shelter. Additionally, the presence of P. grandidentata may have accelerated the recovery of the 1998 plot because aspen can occupy a site quickly after fire (through root-suckering) and aspen groves create more moderate temperature and moisture conditions (Burt Barnes, personal communication). We did not observe much movement between plots. When we did capture individuals, they were males that had traveled from the intermediate plots to the 1917 plot, matching the literature findings that males often travel longer distances (Hirth 1959). One important area requiring further investigation is the influence of post-fire succession on the suitability of habitat for the predators of small mammals. For example, martens are often found in the old growth stage (76 years+), but rarely in other habitats (Fisher and Wilkinson 2005). The 1998 plot could have supported higher numbers of reproducing individuals and juveniles due to reduced levels of predation as compared to the 1917 plot. Overall, very little is known about the effects of fire on carnivores (Fisher and Wilkinson 2005), but the prevalence of disturbance in our trap lines indicates that predators are an active component of the burn plots. Different rates of predation could have an important impact on P. leucopus demography across plots. We thank Burt Barnes for allowing access to the 1998 plot and for providing Master's theses and other information regarding the history of the burn plots. We are also grateful to Phil Myers and Stephanie Seto for their guidance during all aspects of this project.

BIO.G0.28.1,Niche Partitioning in Bats,Biology,Research Paper,"The local abundance of Myotis septentrionalis (Northern bat) and Myotis lucifugus (Little brown bat) were analyzed in three different habitats in northern Michigan: wooded, river, and lakeside. Calls from each of nine sites (three of each habitat) were recorded using an Anabat detector, analyzed using Analyze 2.1, and identified by average frequency and end slope values. A discriminant function analysis was used to identify intermediate calls. Myotis lucifugus, traditionally labeled an aerial hawking species, was found in nearly equal numbers at lakeside and river sites (34 and 33, respectively). Myotis septentrionalis, a specialized gleaner, preferred to forage in the more sheltered wooded sites (P = 0.029, Kruskal Wallis, x2 = 7.11). While both species foraged the most during the early hours of night, M. septentrionalis activity peaked earlier than M. lucifugus activity (P < 0.05, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, D = 0.251). The number of calls recorded for each species was related to neither temperature (P > 0.05, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, D = 0.105161) nor rainfall (Mann-Whitney, M. lucifugus P = 0.738 U = 1535, and M. septentrionalis P = 0.468 U = 1476). Myotis lucifugus and Myotis septentrionalis are two Vespertilionid bats that are sympatric over much of their ranges. Both occur throughout Michigan, and both are insectivorous. Morphologically these two species are very similar. However, M. septentrionalis tends to have longer ears and tragi. The tragus is more than half the length of the ear and comes to a narrow point (Kurta 1995). In M. lucifugus, the tragus is less than half the length of the ear and is rounded (Barclay & Fenton 1980). These species also differ in the frequency of their echolocation calls. The calls of M. septentrionalis are of shorter duration, higher average frequency, and cover a broader range of frequencies than those of M. lucifugus (Faure et al. 1993). This difference in vocalization suggests that these two species have different foraging strategies. Myotis lucifugus is traditionally labeled as an aerial hawker that feeds primarily on aerial insects (Ratcliffe & Dawson 2003). The short, high frequency, broadband calls of M. septentrionalis are characteristic of gleaners (Schnitzler & Kalko 2001). A shorter call prevents overlap between the call and the echo at short distances, while higher average frequency and broader frequency range provide higher resolution of small objects. Data has been presented demonstrating that both species can both glean and hawk prey, although M. septentrionalis tends to be more specialized for gleaning (Ratcliffe & Dawson 2003). Given that both M. lucifugus and M. septentrionalis exhibit behavioral flexibility in foraging technique, and considering that they are sympatric throughout much of their ranges, it is likely that these two species segregate spatially or temporally in a way that reduces interspecific competition. To test whether such segregation exists, we chose to study the relative abundances of the two species in three habitats: wooded, river, and lakeside. Of the three, lakeside sites are the most open, followed by the river sites and then the wooded sites. If the two species are segregating spatially, they should be found in different proportions and different relative abundances in the three habitats. Aerial insects are more abundant in open habitats. Thus, we expected to see a higher relative abundance of M. lucifugus at the lakeside sites where there were more aerial insects to hawk. Additionally, given that the calls of M. septentrionalis are more specialized for gleaning, we expected to see a higher relative abundance of this species at the wooded sites where there were more stationary insects to glean. At the river sites we expected to see roughly equal relative abundances for both species. We then monitored how the relative abundance of each species changes throughout the night to determine if the bats exhibited temporal avoidance and foraged at different times. We also looked at whether or not there was a correlation between the relative abundance of each species and the weather conditions (temperature and rain). Relative abundance was measured by counting the number of call sequences recorded at each site and identifying which species each belonged to. Nine locations in the vicinity of the University of Michigan Biological Station (Pellston, Michigan) were chosen: three lakeside habitats (L1, L2, L3), three river habitats (R1, R2, R3), and three wooded habitats (W1, W2, W3). All of the lakeside sites were on Douglas Lake and within walking distance of Biological Station facilities. Site L1 (45�33.65N, 84�40.61W) was located on the western edge of Biological Station facilities, about one meter away from the edge of the lake. Sites L2 (45�33.74N, 84�40.08W) and L3 (45�33.89N, 84�39.88W) were located on the eastern shore of Douglas Lake. Site L2 was 1 meter above the water surface and 4.5 meters away, and L3 was 1.8 meters above the water surface and 5 meters away. Site L3 was north of L2. Sites R1 (45�19.74N, 84�24.55W) and R2 (45�32.66N, 84�40.82W) were located off of Hogsback Road in Reeses Swamp, along Carp Creek. Site R1 was 2.5 meters above the water surface and 11.5 meters away from the river. Site R2 was south of R1. Site R3 (45�33.47N, 84�45.18W) was located off of Pellston Plain Road by Maple River, 1.5 meters above the water surface and 1 meter away. Site W1 (45�32.30N, 84�42.06W) was located on a seasonal road off of West Burt Lake Road. Site W2 (45�34.13N, 84�39.05W) was located on a seasonal road off of Robinson Road, to the east of the Biological Station. Site W3 (45�33.86N, 84�40.79W) was within walking distance of the Biological Station facilities and was located on Grapevine Trail. The study was conducted for eight nights from June 25, 2004 through July 4, 2004. There was no observation on the nights of June 27 and July 3. The study ran from 9:00 pm until 5:30 am on each night of observation. An Anabat II detector connected to a voice activated tape recorder was left at two sites per night. The first site was visited on the hour and the second was visited on the half hour to allow for travel between sites. Temperature was measured with a mercury thermometer in degrees Fahrenheit. Wind speed was measured with an anemometer in meters per second. Also recorded were rainfall (no rain, light rain, or heavy rain), light (visible moon or no moon), and visibility (fog or no fog). The data on each tape were recorded onto a computer using the program Anabat 5. The calls were analyzed using Analyze 2.1, which provided us with maximum frequency, average frequency, minimum frequency, curvature, duration, end slope, and start slope of each pulse in a call. Within each call, all of the pulses with a modal quality of 0.9 or greater were analyzed. If over half of the pulses had an average frequency greater than 50 KHz, the call was attributed to M. septentrionalis. If over half of the pulses had an average frequency less than 45 KHz, the call was attributed to M. lucifugus. If over half of the end slopes of the pulses were less than -10, the call was attributed to M. septentrionalis. Out of a total of 334 call sequences recorded, 289 were identifiable using the above characteristics. The remaining 45 were intermediate or contained conflicting pulse values. These calls were subjected to a discriminant function analysis, which was based on 17 known M. septentrionalis and 18 known M. lucifugus calls provided by Mr. Matt Wund, University of Michigan Museum of Zoology. This procedure classified 11 of the 45 unknown calls as either M. septentrionalis or M. lucifugus with a posterior probability of 0.95 or greater. These 11 were added to the identified calls, producing a total of 300 identified call sequences. Of these, 79 were identified as M. lucifugus and 221 were identified as M. septentrionalis. Myotis lucifugus and M. septentrionalis are distributed differently among the three kinds of habitats (P = 0.029, Kruskal Wallis, x2 = 7.11). The number of M. lucifugus is about equal at the lakeside and wooded sites and lowest at the river sites, while the number of M. septentrionalis is highest at the wooded sites and lowest at the lakeside sites. Myotis septentrionalis showed a greater segregation between sites than did M. lucifugus. Fig. 2- Proportion of calls made by each species at each habitat as related to the total number of calls made by that species. The two species show spatial segregation (P = 0.029, Kruskal Wallis, x2 = 7.11, n1 = 4, n2 = 5, n3 = 6). For both species, the number of calls was highest in early evening. Myotis septentrionalis showed an earlier peak of activity than M. lucifugus (P < 0.05, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, D = 0.251). Myotis septentrionalis activity drops off by 1:00 am, while the number of M. lucifugus peaks again from 1:00  2:00 am. Fig. 3- Number of calls recorded for each species over time. Fig. 4- Proportion of calls made by each species by time as related to the total number of calls made by that species. For both M. lucifugus (P = 0.738, Mann-Whitney, U = 1535) and M. septentrionalis (P = 0.468, Mann-Whitney, U = 1476), the number of calls was not related to whether it was raining at the time the calls were recorded. Additionally, the relative abundance of neither species was correlated with temperature (P > 0.05, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, D = 0.105161). The absence of M. septentrionalis at lakeside sites and its abundance at wooded sites confirms that this species is specialized for gleaning and prefers to forage in more enclosed habitats, as indicated by its high frequency, broadband calls. This preference serves to separate the niches of the two species and reduce competition between them. While M. septentrionalis prefers to forage in wooded sites, M. lucifugus showed less of a preference. The roughly equal numbers of M. lucifugus at lakeside (34) and wooded (33) sites suggest that this species is a generalist and will both hawk and glean prey. However, 70% of all calls (211 of 300) were recorded at wooded habitats. The 33 M. lucifugus calls at the wooded sites made up only 16% of the total number of calls recorded at wooded sites. At the lakeside sites, the 34 M. lucifugus calls makes up 81% of the total number of calls recorded. Fig. 5- Relative abundance of each species at each of the three habitats. For each species, proportions are calculated as the number of calls recorded at a certain habitat as related to the total number of calls recorded at that habitat. Thus, the relative abundance of M. lucifugus was the highest at the lakeside sites. The unequal proportions of M. lucifugus at lakeside (.81) and wooded (.16) sites further confirms that M. septentrionalis prefers wooded sites over lakeside sites. However, it cannot be concluded from these two pieces of data that M. lucifugus prefers lakeside sites, because M. lucifugus numbers at lakeside sites were equal to those at wooded sites. Both species showed the most activity during the early hours of the night. However, while M. lucifugus becomes active again at about 1:00 am, M. septentrionalis numbers steadily decline and drop off at around that time. This trend may be related to being a gleaner. Because a gleaner must snatch insects off of stationary objects, it would be helpful for them to supplement their echolocation with sight. Further, because sight depends on the availability of light, using sight would be more effective during the earlier hours of the evening. Rainfall and temperature data, neither of which was significant, nonetheless could have had an influence on the temporal data. Rainfall and temperature were recorded once an hour. Thus, calls recorded during an hour in which rainfall was observed were not necessarily recorded in the rain. Another problem with the study arose from limitations of the Anabat II detector. The detector recorded only the number of calls, not the number of bats present. It is possible that multiple passes were made by a single bat. For each species, if the number of calls was evenly distributed amongst the number of bats present, then the number of calls recorded is indicative of the relative abundance of that species, and this problem should not influence our results. However, if most of the calls recorded were made by one or a few bats, then the number of calls was not evenly distributed, and this could have affected our results. It would also be helpful to see if the spatial and temporal segregation we observed exists in areas where the two species are allopatric. If this is the case, then we can conclude that the segregation we observed is due to intrinsic differences between the two and that competition does not influence habitat preference. If, however, either of the species expands its foraging habitats (if either species shows no preference for any of the habitats), then the segregation we observed was due to competition.

BIO.G1.02.1,Biological Significance of Modular Structures in Protein Networks,Biology,Research Paper,"Keywords: module, protein networks, systems biology It is widely assumed that cellular functions are organized in a highly hierarchical and modular mannar (Hartwell, Hopfield et al. 1999). Each module is a discrete object composed of a group of tightly linked components and performs an independent task, seperable from the function of other modules (Hartwell, Hopfield et al. 1999; Ravasz, Somera et al. 2002). With the advent of genome scale data, many efforts have been devoted into identifying modular structures and their biological significance (Barabasi and Oltvai 2004). To thoroughly study the modular structure(Ravasz, Somera et al. 2002; Rives and Galliski 2003; Yook, Oltvai et al. 2004) of large scale networks require effective and automatic method that can separate modules. Clustering could be one of the methods to discover module structure in networks using topological structure (Ravasz, Somera et al. 2002; Giot 2003; Yook, Oltvai et al. 2004). And some studies combined clustering with functional genomics data also gave good result (Stiart, Segal et al. 2003; Tornow and Mewes 2003). By using RNA expression profile data, Han etc. (Han, Bertin et al. 2004) divided the hubs into data hub and party hub and showed modularity organization in yeast protein-protein interaction networks. Fraser (Fraser 2005) studied the evolutionary conservation of data hubs and party hubs and suggested the occurring of modules through exon shuffling. However, the module separation by clustering usually gives ambiguity result (Barabasi and Oltvai 2004), part of which is because of the network's hierarchical structure. But lack of objective judgment could be another reason. Newman (Newman and Girvan 2004) proposed a method to measure the modularity of the separated modular structure and devised a greedy method to separate module according to edge betweenness (Newman 2004). Based on the modularity definition, many other algorithms were invented to get the global maximized modularity because greedy methods could be easily trapped in local maximization (Duch and Arenas 2005; Guimera and Amaral 2005; Massen and Doye 2005). Heuristic algorithms often give better result, especially for the networks with relatively low hierarchical structure. Using stimulated annealing to maximizing the network's modularity, Guimera and Amaral (Guimera and Amaral 2005) was able to identify the functional organization of metabolic networks. According to the topological properties, functional roles were determined for each node and they showed the evolutionary conservation among different roles of nodes. Nevertheless, their result that intra-module hubs are less conserved than the intermodule nodes, which contradicts with Fraser's (Fraser 2005) result for protein networks that intramodule hubs are more conserved. In this paper, modules are separated solely based on the topology of protein networks. The biological significance of modular structures is accessed by functional and evolutionary data. The modular structures show highly evolutionary conservation when comparing the orthologous proteins in yeast and fly modules. The modules of protein-protein interaction networks of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiare and fly Drosophila melanogaster was identified using simulation annealing algorithm. For the protein networks, the largest component contains 3862 nodes (about 94% out of 4216 nodes for the entire network) forming 7208 edges for yeast and 6279 nodes (95% of all) forming 10094 edges. The overall modularity is 0.666 for yeast and 0.685 for fly suggestting a high modular organization of the network (table 1). Table 1. Summery of the characters of the largest component of yeast networks To correlate the functional properties and topological modules, functional classification established by MIPS was used in which each protein is assigned a function category according to the enzyme function. I filtered the data that only functional categories containing more than 10 proteins were used, and totally there are 17 functional categories including unclassified proteins. For each module, the sum of genes in each functional category was calculated. To get the expected number, random module separation ran for 1000 times, and the average was used as the mathematical expectation. I used Figure 1. Profile of functional categories in each module Protein complex is another biological functional module. A protein complex is composed of several proteins that are closely connected to each other and perform a certain function as a whole 'module'. I analyzed the possibility that a pair of interacted proteins also appear in the same complex. The basic logic is that if the network topological modules could correspond to the protein complex, we should observe a higher possibility to find a pair of interacted proteins within the same module than between different modules. For within module connections, there are 1046 interacted pairs of protein and 641 of them are in the same complex. While for between module connections, only 58 out of 333. The difference is very significant (2 by 2 contingency test, p < 0.0001) which strongly suggest the correspondence between protein complex and topological modules. A discrete module that performs a certain function is much likely located in the same cellular location. Based on this idea, global protein localization data in budding yeast is used to check the biased distribution of each module. The same as functional category, each location of proteins in modules is counted and simulation was used to calculate the expected distribution. Nonsynonymous changes in sequences will result in protein sequences change, and could be used to measure the distance or evolutionary conservation of proteins. And a low evolutionary rate usually indicates strong functional constraint. Nonsynonymous substitutions per site (dN) was calculated for all the genes with ortholog in S. bayanus a closely related species. The Spearman's rank correlation was used to evaluate the evolutionary conservation of topological structure (table 1). The result shows only dN and within-module degree is very significantly and negatively correlated which indicate that within-module hubs are more conserved. And this result is robust because there is no significant correlation between between-module degree and dN which would not confound the correlation between within-module degree. Table 1. Correlations between evolutionary conservation and topological structure Another way to measure the evolutionary conservation is the phylogenetic conservation across species. If the gene subjects high functional constraints, it is very unlikely to be lost during the evolution. So, by counting the gene loss events on a phylogenetic tree also reflects the evolutionary conservation for the gene. I used all S. cerevisiea gene to blast against the other 9 species and identified a number of gene loss events on each brach. And in the following work I will analyze the distribution and correlation with the network topological properties. Because of the functional correspondence to module, the importance of each module may be varied depending on the functional importance. To access the differences among modules, I examined the distribution of essential genes which would cause death if knocked out. If one module has more essential genes, it tends to be more important in terms of function. While if there is no functional differences among modules, essential genes should be randomly distributed in each module. Figure 3 Profile of essential genes among moduels The Although the interactions between proteins are less conserved across distant species (Gandhi, Zhong et al. 2006), they may show some conservation at modular structure level in which orthologous genes across species share the same module. To test this hypothesis, I used the same method to separate modules for D. drosophila protein-protein interaction network. And the homologous genes are identified using reciprocal blast best hits. If the homologous genes are grouped into the same module, the hierarchical modular structure will be conserved. The result shows this (figure 4). The same as function and location, conservation profile is used to show the relationship. And the The hierarchical structure of the protein networks could correspond to the functional category, which is consistent with previous studies(Tornow and Mewes 2003; Yook, Oltvai et al. 2004). However, my result does not suggest a direct one-to-one or one-to-multiple correspondence between functional categories and modules. Noise in the data maybe one reason; another reason could be the module structure may not reflect the enzyme based functional classification. The direct evidence that pairs of proteins within the same module tend to be in the same protein complex structure indicate that protein complex is better correspondence to the module structure (Spirin and Mirny 2003). Jeong etc. (Jeong, Mason et al. 2001) studied the lethality and centrality in protein networks, and their result suggest a strong correlation between degree centrality (the same as node degree) and gene essentiality. My data analysis also proved it in which the number of connections of nodes is highly and negatively correlated with evolutionary conservation dN (p < 0.00001). Moreover, because no correlation between between-module degree and dN but significant negative correlation between within-module degree and dN suggest the overall correlation comes from within-module degree. This result suggests that the core of the module is more conserved and more important than the periphery nodes which is also consistent with Fraser's (Fraser 2005) study but different from Guimera and Amaral's (Guimera and Amaral 2005) study. Because highly pleiotropic genes tend to have multiple functions and they could be the nodes link to many other modules, they are usually thought to be more conserved (Fraser 2005). Participation coefficient measures how the between-module links distributed (Guimera and Amaral 2005; Guimera and Amaral 2005). This result suggest that either participation coefficient is not corresponded to pleiotropy or there is no correlation between pleiotropy and evolutionary conservation. The result of no significant correlation between dN and betweenness centrality is somehow surprising. Because Hahn and Kern's (Hahn and Kern 2004) study suggests a significant correlation between betweenness centrality and gene essentiality in three eukaryotic protein networks, although the correlation is very week. Finally, although the differences among modules are statistically significant, only a few of them show a strong biased distribution. And querying these modules to functional category distribution gives no significant biased distribution. In fact, protein-protein interaction data set is highly noisy (Barabasi and Oltvai 2004). This is partly come from the random errors in large scale experiments. But they may also come from the method of yeast two hybrids to detect interacting protein pairs. A number of studies (Aloy and Russell 2002; Han, Dupuy et al. 2005) suggested artifacts in protein interaction networks and sampling may also result in biased data set. This result in the genome scale analysis becomes very hard because noise reduces the signals significantly. Protein-protein interaction networks data set for Saccharomyces cerevisiea was downloaded from MIPS (http://mips.gsf.de/). Only the nodes in the largest component of the network were used to separate module by simulated annealing algorithm. Functional annotation for S. cerevisiea genes were also downloaded from MIPS and protein complex data came from IntAct database (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact). I compared the distribution of gene in each module and the functional category for each gene to evaluate the functional correspondence of module structure. Protein complex data was another way to measure the biological meaning of network module. I also calculated the betweenness centrality for each node using Pejak. The evolutionary rate dN for S. cerevisiea genes were calculated against orthologous genes of S. bayanus. The loss of genes on other braches of yeast was also used to evaluate the phylogenetic conservation. Specificly, I use BLAST against the whole genome sequences of other 9 species, S. paradoxus, S. mikatea, S. bayanus, C. glabrata, K. waltii, K. lactis, D. hansenii, Y. lipolytice, N. crassa and S. pombe using 0.1 as criteria to detect gene loss. Parsomony method was used to calculate gene loss events on each brach with S. pombe as the outgroup. I compared the correlation among within module-degree, between-module degree, participation coefficient, betweenness centrality, dN and gene loss events to get evolutionary conservation for the roles of nodes. Finally, the protein-protein interaction data for Drosophila melanogaster (downloaded from flybase (http://flybase.net)) was used to detect the evolutionary conservation of hierarchical modular structure between yeast and fly.

BIO.G1.05.1,Inferring Swimming Mode from Skeletal Proportions in Fossil Pinnipedimorphs,Biology,Research Paper,"� Since the first vertebrates invaded the terrestrial realm around 350 million years ago (Clack 2002a, 2002b; Long and Gordon 2004), several subsequent groups of tetrapods have become readapted for an aquatic lifestyle (Mazin and de Buffr�nil 2001). Among mammals, the spectrum of secondarily aquatic forms ranges from fully aquatic cetaceans and sirenians to semiaquatic taxa that spend much of their time on land but forage in the water (Gingerich 2003). One of the most speciose groups of secondarily aquatic mammals today, composed of about 36 extant species, is the Pinnipedia (Berta and Adam 2001; Berta et al. 2006). Pinnipeds are highly derived, mostly aquatic mammals within the Order Carnivora and are divided into three modern families: Odobenidae (walruses), Otariidae (sea lions and fur seals), and Phocidae (true or earless seals) (Berta et al. 2006). Based on morphological and paleontological evidence, pinnipeds were traditionally thought to have a diphyletic origin (McLaren 1960; Tedford 1976). This view maintained that the odobenids and otariids were derived from ursid (bears) ancestry and that phocids had a separate origin from somewhere within the mustelid (weasels, otters, etc.) lineage. Wyss (1987) reassessed the morphological evidence and suggested a common origin for all pinnipeds. A number of morphological (Wyss 1988; Berta et al. 1989; Wyss 1989; Wyss and Flynn 1993; Berta and Wyss 1994) and molecular studies (Sarich 1969; �rnason and Widegren 1986; Vrana et al. 1994; �rnason et al. 1995; Lento et al. 1995; Flynn and Nedbal 1998; Davis et al. 2004; �rnason et al. 2006) have since given strong support for pinniped monophyly, but the arctoid group from which pinnipeds arose has not yet been agreed upon, with studies suggesting ursid (Wyss and Flynn 1993; Berta and Wyss 1994; Vrana et al. 1994; Lento et al. 1995), mustelid (�rnason and Widegren 1986; Flynn and Nedbal 1998), or general arctoid ancestry (Davis et al. 2004; �rnason et al. 2006). One way in which the pinniped groups significantly differ from each other is how they swim. Otariids swim using a form of locomotion called pectoral oscillation, in which the highly modified fore-flippers are the sole source of thrust while the hind limbs and axial skeleton play no apparent role (English 1976; Feldkamp 1987a, 1987b). Conversely, phocids and odobenids swim using primarily pelvic oscillation, in which the cranial end of the body is held rigid while the hind limbs perform a side-to-side sculling motion to generate forward thrust (Tarasoff et al. 1972; Gordon 1981). Both modes of swimming are highly derived and require very specialized morphologies in order to perform them (Fish 1996; Berta and Adam 2001). During the evolutionary transition from land to sea in pinnipeds, taxa intermediate between the fully terrestrial ancestors and the mostly aquatic descendents would have lacked some of these skeletal adaptations and would have swum in a manner different from modern forms. Since locomotion is central to an animals ability to forage, evade predators, disperse, and migrate (Fish 1992), understanding how these highly derived modes of locomotion evolved from less efficient modes can inform us about the ecologies and lifestyles of intermediate species and help us understand how the land-to-sea transition progressed. Models have been proposed to explain how highly derived modes of swimming could have evolved through semiaquatic taxa performing a series of increasingly efficient swimming styles (Fish 1996, 2000, 2001), but these studies have been based primarily on studies of swimming in living aquatic and semiaquatic mammals. Few studies have assessed the evolution of swimming mode in secondarily aquatic taxa using fossil evidence. Berta and Adam (2001) used the morphologies of extant pinnipeds to interpret the locomotor capabilities of extinct forms and placed these swimming styles onto a phylogeny to assess how forelimb- and hind limb-dominated swimming evolved within pinnipeds. Their results suggested: (1) that forelimb-dominated swimming was ancestral for the group, (2) that hind limb-dominated swimming arose once at the base of the Phocomorpha (the sister group to the Otariidae), and (3) that there was one reversal back to forelimb swimming in the Dusignathinae (Figure 1). However, the interpretations of locomotor mode in some of the fossil taxa in this study (mainly Enaliarctos and the Desmatophocidae) are not as straightforward as these authors presented them to be, and their potential locomotor capabilities could stand to be reassessed. The most primitive known group of pinnipedimorphs is the Enaliarctinae (Barnes 1989, 1990; Berta 1991; Barnes 1992). Enaliarctos mealsi, from the late Oligocene of California, is known on the basis of a virtually complete skeleton (Figure 2A-B), and when it was initially described, it was thought to swim using a combination of fore flippers, hind flippers, and undulation of the axial skeleton to generate thrust (Berta et al. 1989; Berta and Ray 1990). However, Berta and Adam (2001) asserted that Enaliarctos seems slightly more specialized for forelimb swimming (p. 256) and coded this species as being a forelimb-dominated swimmer in their locomotor analysis. To further support this notion, they argued that since this fossil taxon is bracketed by two groups that use forelimb propulsion (the Ursidae and Otariidae) it is most parsimonious to interpret Enaliarctos as a forelimb swimmer rather than a hind limb swimmer. This interpretation has persisted in additional sources (e.g. Berta et al. 2006) but has yet to be quantitatively tested. Likewise, there has been disagreement as to how the desmatophocid Allodesmus kernensis swam (Figure 2C). This species is a member of the Desmatophocidae, a group which was once considered to be a subfamily of Otariidae (Mitchell 1966; Barnes 1972; Mitchell 1975; Barnes 1989) but is now thought to be the sister group of the Phocidae (Berta 1994; Berta and Wyss 1994; Dem�r� and Berta 2002). The initial descriptions of Allodesmus postulated it used solely its forelimbs in aquatic locomotion, much as modern otariids do (Mitchell 1966; Barnes 1972). However, Giffin (1992) demonstrated that the anatomy of the neural canal in this species suggests that its torso, fore-, and hind limbs all possessed significant innervation. This morphology was found to be most similar to odobenids, and Giffin called into question the previous interpretations of forelimb-dominated swimming. Berta and Adam (2001) noted that Allodesmus has features indicative of both forelimb and hind limb swimming, but they coded it as being a hind limb swimmer in their locomotor analysis, an interpretation that has persisted in recent references (e.g. Berta et al. 2006). For at least these two species, there is some question as to whether they swam using primarily forelimb- or hind limb-dominated locomotion, and given their phylogenetic positions in relation to other pinnipedimorph taxa, understanding the evolution of locomotion within the entire group is contingent on having accurate inferences about their swimming mode. Given their relatively complete skeletons, locomotor interpretations for Enaliarctos and Allodesmus can tested by including them in a principal components analysis (PCA) on skeletal proportions in extant semiaquatic mammals like that performed by Gingerich (2003). This method has been used to interpret locomotor mode in fossil whales (Gingerich 2003), desmostylians (Gingerich 2005), and pantolestids (Rose and von Koenigswald 2005), and by finding which modern mammals Enaliarctos and Allodesmus are most similar to in overall skeletal proportions, we will be able to make well-informed inferences about their swimming modes. These results can then be looked at in a phylogenetic context, as was done by Berta and Adam (2001), in order to assess how locomotor evolution occurred in pinnipeds. Of the fourteen skeletal measurements included in the PCA performed by Gingerich (2003), thirteen of the measurements for Enaliarctos were obtained from Berta and Ray (1990) (Table 1). The missing measurement, the length of pedal phalanx III-2, was estimated by scaling it down from the length of metatarsal III in the same proportion as pedal phalanx II-2 is scaled down in length from metatarsal II. A PCA was carried out on 14 skeletal measurements for 61 extant semiaquatic taxa following the methods described in Gingerich (2003). These 61 taxa included the 50 specimens used by Gingerich (2003), as well as 11 additional pinnipeds and lutrine mustelids to increase the representation of these diverse groups in the data set (Table 1). Eigenvector coefficients for each of most informative principal component axes were multiplied by the normalized, natural log-transformed measurements and summed across all 14 measurements to generate scores for each species for each principal component. Enaliarctos was not included in the PCA itself, but was added as a supplemental taxon, following the treatment of fossil taxa in previous analyses (Gingerich 2003, 2005; Rose and von Koenigswald 2005), and was plotted in the same space as the modern taxa using the eigenvector coefficients generated by the PCA to calculate its PC scores. For Allodesmus, no pedal phalanges are known, so an additional PCA was carried out using only 12 of the 14 measurements. Measurements for the thorax, lumbus, humerus, radius, femur, and tibia of Allodesmus were obtained from tables in Mitchell (1966), while the remaining measurements were estimated from photographic plates therein (Table 1). Like Enaliarctos, Allodesmus was not included in the PCA itself, but its PC scores were calculated using the eigenvector coefficients resulting from the analysis. The locomotor modes inferred for these two taxa based on the PCAs were then placed onto a phylogeny of pinnipeds to assess when different swimming styles appeared within the history of the group, thus giving us an overall picture of how this important behavior may have been evolving during this land-to-sea transition. The first PCA performed in this study included 14 skeletal measurements for 61 extant semiaquatic mammals. The eigenvalues and eigenvector coefficients (loadings) for each principal component are listed in Table 2, with the eigenvector coefficients also being shown graphically in Figures 3-4. The variation in this data set was reduced to three informative axes. PC-I accounted for 93.1% of the total variance in measurements, and all of the eigenvector coefficients are positive and of a similar magnitude. This is very similar to Gingerich's (2003) results, and this axis can best be understood as representing overall size, with smaller individuals possessing more negative PC-I scores and larger individuals possessing more positive PC-I scores. PC-II accounted for 4.2% of the total variance, and the eigenvector coefficients indicate that the strongest contrast on PC-II is between individuals with long manual and pedal phalanges and individuals with a long femur and ilium, just as in Gingerich's (2003) analysis. This axis can thus be interpreted as separating more terrestrial species on the positive end of the axis from more aquatic species on the negative end. PC-III accounted for 0.8% of the total variance, and the eigenvector coefficients indicate that the strongest contrast is between taxa with a long lumbus, a long third metatarsal, and long pedal phalanges and taxa with a long third metacarpal and long manual phalanges. Again, this follows Gingerich's (2003) results, so PC-III can be interpreted as separating hind limb-dominated swimmers with more negative PC-III scores from forelimb-dominated swimmers with more positive PC-III scores. PC scores for each taxon for the first three principal components are listed in Table 4 and shown graphically in Figures 3-4. When the PC scores for Enaliarctos are plotted in the same space as the modern taxa, it plots right with other pinnipeds on the size axis and appears to be less aquatic than the majority of the modern otariids and phocids but more aquatic than Odobenus on the terrestrial/aquatic axis. On the locomotion axis, Enaliarctos actually plots within the space occupied by the Phocidae, suggesting that Enaliarctos was primarily a hind limb-dominated swimmer and calling into question the recent interpretations that this species swam primarily using its forelimbs to generate propulsion. The second PCA included only 12 skeletal measurements for the 61 extant semiaquatic mammals. The eigenvalues and eigenvector coefficients (loadings) for each principal component are listed in Table 3, with the eigenvector coefficients also being shown graphically in Figures 5-6. The variation in the data was again reduced to three informative axes. PC-I accounted for 93.8% of the total variance in the dataset, and since the eigenvector coefficients were all positive and of a similar magnitude, this axis can again be interpreted as representing size. PC-II accounted for 3.6% of the total variance, and compared with the eigenvector coefficients from the first PCA, the coefficients for each measurement in this case fell in relatively the same locations as in the previous analysis, simply with loadings for pedal phalanges being absent. The largest contrast on PC-II is thus between individuals with long manual phalanges and individuals with a long femur and ilium. It appears safe to assume that this axis can again be interpreted as separating more terrestrial taxa on the positive end from more aquatic taxa on the negative end. PC-III accounted for 0.9% of the total variance, and while the more intermediate eigenvector coefficients shifted around slightly, the most extreme values are the same as in the first PCA. The largest contrast on PC-III in this second case is between individuals with a long lumbus, long third metatarsal, and long tibia and individuals with a long third metacarpal and long manual phalanges. This axis can again be interpreted as separating hind limb-dominated swimmers with more negative PC-III scores from forelimb-dominated swimmers with more positive PC-III scores. PC scores for each taxon for the first three principal components are listed in Table 4 and shown graphically in Figures 5-6. When PC scores are calculated for Allodesmus and plotted in the same space as the scores of the extant species, it plots among the larger pinnipeds but appears less aquatic than all pinnipeds except for Odobenus. On the locomotion axis, Allodesmus plots outside of both the Phocidae and the Otariidae, but is much closer to the Otariidae on the forelimb-dominated side of the axis. This implies that Allodesmus has skeletal proportions similar to pectoral oscillators and swam primarily using its forelimbs, which is counter to the most recent interpretations of locomotion in this species. These new locomotor interpretations were then analyzed in a phylogenetic context following the approach of Berta and Adam (2001) (Figure 7). The topology of the tree follows the results of Berta and Wyss (1994) and Dem�r� (1994), and the inferred locomotor modes of taxa not included in the PCA follow the interpretations of Berta and Adam (2001). If Enaliarctos is indeed a hind limb-dominated swimmer and Allodesmus a forelimb-dominated swimmer as the PCA results suggest, then it appears that hind limb-dominated swimming had to have arisen at least two times independently. If we posit that hind limb swimming arose once at the base of the Phocomorpha ([Desmatophocidae + Phocidae] + Odobenidae) and once in the Enaliarctinae lineage, then we also must posit an additional reversal to forelimb swimming in the Desmatophocidae. Another possibility would be to propose that hind limb swimming arose independently within the Phocidae and the Odobenidae, which would decrease the number of reversals to forelimb swimming (only once within the Dusignathinae), but would increase the number of independent acquisitions of hind limb-dominated swimming to three. The main point is that if these locomotor interpretations are correct for Enaliarctos and Allodesmus, then the evolution of swimming in pinnipeds involves a number of additional locomotor transitions than what Berta and Adam's (2001) initial analysis proposed. Like many other tetrapod groups, ancestral pinnipeds embarked on a journey beginning on land and eventually finishing in the sea. Looking at modern secondarily- aquatic vertebrates and their supposed ancestral groups, it is clear that the starting and ending points for each of these land-to-sea transitions are unique, and the pathway that each of these lineages took to readapt to an aquatic environment was novel as well (Gingerich 2005). One aspect of reconstructing and understanding these transitions is to elucidate the evolution of locomotor modes, which informs us about the way in which an organism could interact with other species in its environment. Previous attempts to analyze the evolution of locomotion in pinnipeds have relied on the presence or absence of osteological characters associated with each swimming mode (Berta and Adam 2001). This technique may work well for taxa close to the modern groups of pinnipeds, but it presents difficulties when interpreting locomotor capabilities in taxa that are less closely-related to the modern clades. Both Enaliarctos mealsi (Berta et al. 1989; Berta and Ray 1990) and Allodesmus kernensis (Giffin 1992) had been described as possessing features consistent with using forelimbs, hind limbs, and their axial skeleton to generate thrust during aquatic locomotion, but were shoehorned into either forelimb- or hind limb-dominated swimming based on possession of a handful of characters (Berta and Adam 2001; Berta et al. 2006). Their relatively complete skeletons allow their overall skeletal proportions to be looked at in comparison with modern semiaquatic taxa, and by elucidating which modern taxa they are most similar to proportionally, we have a way to quantitatively assess locomotor interpretations in these fossil taxa. The placement of Enaliarctos on the size axis (PC-I) indicated that it was an average-sized species when compared with modern pinnipeds, and it appeared to be less aquatic than most of the modern pinnipeds on the axis for PC-II. It plotted among the phocids on the locomotion axis (PC-III), suggesting that it swam using a hind limb-dominated mode of locomotion. This interpretation is in contrast to recent suggestions that it was more specialized for forelimb swimming (Berta and Adam 2001; Berta et al. 2006), but given that its hind limbs are relatively larger than its forelimbs (Berta and Ray 1990), hind limb-dominated swimming seems like a more plausible interpretation. Allodesmus appeared to be of a similar size to some of the larger modern pinnipeds, but like Enaliarctos, its PC-II score indicated that it was less aquatically-adapted than most modern pinnipeds. Its PC-III score placed it closest to modern otariids, which suggests that it might have used predominantly forelimb swimming. This, again, is in contrast to the most recent interpretations (Berta and Adam 2001; Berta et al. 2006), but it supports the notions put forth by earlier authors that this animal was similar to modern otariids in habit (Mitchell 1966; Barnes 1972; Mitchell 1975). Placing these new interpretations onto a phylogeny to assess the evolution of swimming mode in pinnipeds complicates the picture depicted by Berta and Adam (2001), as it calls for several additional transitions in locomotor mode than they proposed. But subscribing to this overall picture of locomotor evolution is contingent upon the inferred phylogenetic relationships being correct. While pinnipeds are generally agreed to be a monophyletic group derived from arctoid carnivores, the relationships among members within the group are still contentious. Traditionally, otariids and odobenids were allied within the Otarioidea (McLaren 1960; Barnes 1972; Mitchell 1975; Tedford 1976; Barnes 1989), but many recent analyses have placed the odobenids as the sister group to the Phocoidea (Desmatophocidae + Phocidae), forming the Phocomorpha (Wyss 1987; Berta et al. 1989; Wyss 1989; Berta and Ray 1990; Berta 1991; Berta and Wyss 1994; Dem�r� and Berta 2002; Berta et al. 2006). Molecular analyses have consistently suggested that odobenids are more closely related to otariids (Sarich 1969; �rnason et al. 1995; Lento et al. 1995; Flynn and Nedbal 1998; Davis et al. 2004; Flynn and Wesley-Hunt 2005; �rnason et al. 2006), but some authors argue that these results are due to long-branch attraction since the odobenid lineage appears to have split off early in the history of the group (Berta and Adam 2001; Berta et al. 2006). Using inferred locomotor mode like a character on a phylogenetic tree to interpret the evolution of locomotion is obviously contingent on the topology of that tree, so the picture of swimming evolution derived from this strategy could change drastically if the inferred relationships among the groups were to change. Thus, the interpretations of locomotor evolution across all pinniped lineages should be viewed with caution in light of the equivocal relationships among the different groups. We should also be careful not to think that any animal must use exclusively one swimming mode. Modern otters use a variety of different swimming modes depending on what they are doing and where they are in the water (Fish 1994), and even the modern walrus, while using primarily pelvic oscillation, is known to use pectoral paddling as well when swimming at slow speeds (Gordon 1981). Given that Enaliarctos (Berta et al. 1989; Berta and Ray 1990) and Allodesmus (Giffin 1992; Berta and Adam 2001) have both been described as possessing adaptations for multiple swimming modes, we must not too quickly interpret them as using solely forelimb- or hind limb-dominated swimming, despite their placement on the locomotion axis in the PCA. The PCA simply demonstrated which modern animals were most similar in proportions to these fossil taxa, and by association, we were able to infer something about their locomotion based on that of the modern taxa with which they clustered. For Enaliarctos in particular, it is actually quite attractive to hypothesize that it may have used multiple locomotor modes given its relationship to modern pinnipeds. If it could be shown to be the common ancestor of all later pinnipedimorphs rather than the outgroup to them, it may help explain how distinctly different locomotor modes (fore- and hind limb-dominated swimming) could have evolved from a common ancestor that showed a propensity for both fore- and hind limb swimming. By incorporating stratigraphic data into these phylogenetic reconstructions, we could test ancestor-descendent hypotheses, and this may offer a more complete picture of both locomotor evolution and the evolution of these groups in general. The PCA performed in this paper was successful in demonstrating the modern pinnipeds to which Enaliarctos mealsi and Allodesmus kernensis were most similar in skeletal proportions. Their similarity to modern phocids and otariids respectively called into question some previous hypotheses of dominant swimming mode, thus slightly complicating our view of how this critical behavior evolved within the group. Yet while these results may obscure our understanding of the evolution of this behavior, they demonstrate the importance of using multiple approaches to assess behavior in extinct taxa. Using solely osteological characters or statistical techniques gives an incomplete picture of these animals and their supposed abilities. Interpretations from statistical analyses like the PCA performed here should be used to supplement an assessment of osteological characters when inferring locomotor modes and other behaviors, as it is important to garner as much information as possible when reconstructing the lifestyles of extinct creatures.

BIO.G2.01.1,Relationships and Biogeography of Antillean Cichlids,Biology,Research Paper,"Geological reconstructions proposed for the Greater Antilles fit into two major categories, each with different biogeographic consequences. One category of reconstructions suggests that Early Oligocene landbridge connected the Greater Antillean islands to northern South America. The other suggests a period of coalescence in the Mesozoic of some of the Antillean islands with portions of Central America. A molecular phylogenetic analysis that includes the endemic cichlid faunas of the Greater Antilles, as well as from South and Central America, results in a phylogeny that is congruent with the later reconstruction. Also, this analysis finds that a dispersal scenario is not the simplest or most robust explanation for the presence of these cichlids on the Antilles. Cichlidae is a monophyletic group of perciform fishes with a species diversity approaching 2,000 described species (Kullander 1998, Sparks 2001). The group is widely distributed on former Gondwanan fragments: South and Central America (300 spp.), Africa (1,000 spp.), Madagascar (>18spp.), India (3spp.), and the Middle East (3 spp.) (Figure 1). There has been resurgence of discussion of the historical biogeography of this group in recent years with the discovery of the oldest known cichlid fossils and new molecular evidence (Murray 2001, 2001b; Sparks 2001; Vences 2001; Kumazawa et al. 2000; see review in Chakrabarty 2003). Recent phylogenetic work finds that each continental assemblage of cichlids forms its own monophyletic group with the exception of Madagascar (Sparks 2001; Farias et al. 1999, 2000; Streelman et al. 1998; Zardoya et al.1996, see Chakrabarty 2003 for alternatives and explanation). This has led some to propose a Cretaceous origin of Cichlidae before the break-up of Gondwana (Sparks 2001; Stiassny 1991). Dispersalists point out the minimum age of the Cichlidae based on the oldest known fossils is Eocene (45 million years ago), and use the lack of fossil cichlids before this time as evidence for recent dispersal events to explain current cichlid distributions (Murray 2001b; Lundberg 1993). Malagasy cichlids are shown to be sister to cichlids on India in every analysis to include them (Stiassny et al. 2001; Sparks 2001; Farias et al. 1999, 2000; Streelman et al. 1998; Zardoya 1996; Cichocki 1976; Streelman & Karl 1997; Lippitsch 1995; Oliver 1984; Kullander 1998). This Malagasy-Indian relationship is the most well corroborated sister grouping of cichlids and in the dispersalist framework this relationship would mean that cichlids were capable of dispersing across the entire Indian Ocean but not across the Mozambique Channel (430 km wide at its narrowest point) to Africa. Cichlids are primarily a strictly freshwater water group with some species able to tolerate brackish waters and a few that are considered salt tolerant (Murray 2001b). With no known cases of cichlids dispersing from one landmass to another across a salt-water divide, the marine environment should still be considered a barrier to cichlid dispersal. There are landmasses that are not Gondwanan in origin that have cichlids, these are the islands of Cuba and Hispaniola (Figure 2). These islands have a complex geological history and there are a number of alternative hypotheses of how the fauna and flora of these islands evolved. The mechanism that allowed cichlids to invade these islands will be explored in this study. The relationships of the Greater Antillean cichlid fauna are important because the Antilles are not geologically Gondawanan in origin, although they may have in various times of their history been connected to Gondwanan fragments. Leon Croizat's (1962) metaphor of vicariance biogeography being like reconstructing a pane of glass that has been repeatedly shattered seems particularly relevant to the Greater Antilles. Geologically speaking, the Greater Antilles rest upon a small plate located between the much larger North America, South American and Cocos and Nazca plates. The Caribbean plate itself can be divided into a series of minor plates that have separated and merged at various times in their history (Perfit & Williams 1989). Despite their history and position on a tectonic plate, these islands are usually labeled as oceanic. This nomenclature, like secondary freshwater, assumes a priori that overwater dispersal is the only mechanism for organisms to populate these islands. Paulay (1994) defined oceanic islands as islands that have never been connected to a mainland continent and therefore are populated solely by dispersal. Given the aforementioned tectonic reconstructions, this definition does not fit the Greater Antilles. Two alternative tectonic reconstructions involving a land connection between the Greater Antilles and either mainland South America or Central America will be discussed. Rosen (1975, 1985) developed a vicariance model based on Malfait and Dinkelman (1972) and Tedford's (1974) geological models of the Antilles. This view gives a Mesozoic age to the fauna of the Greater Antillean islands. This reconstruction of the Antilles, supported by many others (Pindell et al. 1988; Ross & Scotese 1988; Pindell & Barrett 1990; Pitman et al. 1993; Schuchert 1935; Dickinson & Coney 1980; but see alternatives in Hedges 1982), proposes that the Greater Antilles originated in the Pacific Ocean as a series of islands that connected North and South America as a temporary closely linked island chain circa 80 million years ago, in a position occupied by present day Central America. This arc then broke in the early Cenozoic and drifted to its current position. In Rosen's model, Jamaica, the Caymans, southwest Hispaniola, and western Cuba were connected to the southern and eastern parts of Yucatan (northern Central America) until they separated at the end of the Cretaceous, 65 million years ago. In the alternative view proposed by Iturralde-Vinent and MacPhee (1999) based on geological evidence, a short-lived connection between the Greater Antillean Islands (Cuba, Hispaniola, Puerto Rico and possibly Jamaica) and northwest South America existed circa 32 million years ago. The authors name this Early Oligocene landbridge GAARlandia (from Greater Antilles + Aves Ridge). The consequence of this alternative is that the Greater Antillean Island chain would have had a more recent connection with South America than with Central America. The authors do not believe that there was a land connection between these islands and Central America in a way that would explain the current faunal distributions. This sets up two testable alternative hypotheses, between the relationships of Antillean cichlids with either Central or South American lineages. Non-congruence of phylogenetic pattern and sequence of divergence would favor dispersal. There are five known cichlids from the Antilles, Cichlasoma tetracanthus, C. ramsdeni, C. haitiensis, C. vombergi and C. woodringi (see Myers 1928 and Darlington 1957 for discussion on other possible species, and distributions). The first two are restricted to Cuba, and the others to Hispaniola. The fossil C. woodringi is either Upper or Middle Miocene (23 to 5 mya) in age (Rivas 1986; Myers 1928) or Pliocene (Casciotta & Arratia 1993; Murray 2001b). It has the notoriety of being the only known freshwater fossil from the Antilles (Burgess & Franz 1989). Bussing (1985) and Rivas (pers. comm. in Burgess & Franz 1989) comment that this fossil is indistinguishable from C. haitiensis, an extant Hispaniolan species. Bussing (1985) also likens it to the Parapetenia of Central America. The generic name of these species (Cichlasoma) is sometimes referred to as Nandopsis, these names are homonyms and will be used interchangeable in this paper. The genus Cichlasoma (sensu lato), to which all the Antillean cichlids belong, dominates the Central American cichlid fauna (75 of about 100 or more species) (Roe et al. 1997; Miller 1966; Martin & Bermingham 1998; Kullander 1983). This genus is also found throughout South America and north to Texas, but its diversity in Central America is unmatched (Bussing 1985). To date no formal phylogenetic analysis has included the Cuban and Hispaniolan species with Central American and South American species. Rosen (1975) presented a cladogram that had a sister relationship between Central America and the Antillean cichlid fauna, however it included only the Central American and Antillean fauna. This four taxon cladogram was cited using a personal communication from Cichocki who did not include this analysis in any published material. Loiselle (1985) also lists Central American sister species for the Antillean cichlids, but does not discuss his phylogenetic method; it appears as if his notion is based solely on his own similarity judgment. Without a phylogenetic diagnosis, we lack a measure for selecting between alternative mechanisms for explaining this disjunct distribution. Before discussing the results of the analyses done here, it is important to discuss some important contributions on prior hypotheses of vicariance and dispersal mechanisms for these cichlids and freshwater fauna of this area; they are reviewed below. Myers (1938, 1966; see also Darlington 1957) hypothesized that the freshwater fishes of the West Indies dispersed from Central America, mainly due to the salt tolerance of these secondary freshwater fishes. Myers believed the islands formed in situ without connection to other landmasses. Rivas (1986) noted that the native cichlids on Cuba and Hispaniola are known only from landlocked freshwater habitats, never brackish or marine habitats. Bussing (1985) and Martin and Bermingham (1998) hypothesize that South American and Central American cichlids may have dispersed around the continental landmasses by migrating along coastlines, pointing again to salt tolerance in these cichlids. Kullander (1983) gives the only mention of Neotropical cichlids being caught in brackish water. Endemism of cichlid species on Cuba and Hispaniola implies that either (1) they speciated there, presumably long ago, (2) there have been no successful dispersal events from mainland to island or from island to island, or (3) extinctions have left this pattern of endemism (so called reciprocal monophyly). A number of authors have stated that Cuba, particularly its eastern half, was once united with Hispaniola in the early history of the Caribbean (Williams 1989; Perfit & Williams 1989). According to Pitman et al. (1993), Cuba and Hispaniola did not separate until a shearing in the late Middle Eocene. Nearly 90 % of the 71 species of Antillean freshwater fishes occur on Cuba and Hispaniola (Burgess & Franz 1989). Sixty-five of these are endemic to an island or island group (Burgess & Franz 1989). Surprisingly, Puerto Rico, the fourth largest Antillean island, separated from Hispaniola by only the narrow Mona Passage (130 km), is completely lacking in native freshwater fishes. Puerto Rico does have available habitats, as an introduced African cichlid and many other introduced species maintain populations there (Burgess & Franz 1989). Fishes dispersing from Central or South America would also probably reach Jamaica or the lower Antilles first because of their location (Fig.8). There are no cichlids on Jamaica (it does have six other native freshwater species), and there are only two native freshwater fishes on the entire Lesser Antilles. The absence of cichlids from Jamaica and particularly Puerto Rico does not bode well for the Iturralde-Vinent and MacPhee (1999) hypothesis, which posits a connection between Cuba, Hispaniola and South America, with Jamaica and Puerto Rico in-between. A complete extinction of the freshwater fish fauna would be required on Puerto Rico, after the suggested landbridge, for their hypothesis to be plausible. Based on his vicariance model, Rosen (1975) gave a Mesozoic minimum age to the freshwater fish fauna of the Antilles including cichlids, atherinids (silversides), poeciliids and other Cyprinodontiformes, synbranchid eels and gars. Rauchenberger (1988) attempted to create a composite area cladogram from 12 other cladograms using these taxa to support Rosen's vicariance model. Most of the trees she used in her analysis are poorly resolved (the cichlid area cladogram she used is an uninformative polytomy), as she notes herself. Only the Gambusia tree (a poeciliid) provided much resolution to her composite. Unfortunately the Gambusia tree she cites (but does not show) from Fink (1971, 1971b) ignores some key elements of the original cladogram (Fink pers. comm.). Her analysis also included only one South American species, which, due to its placement at the base of the cladogram, did not affect the composite tree. It is not surprising then that she found a close relationship between the Antillean and Central American taxa (the only possibility, given her sampling). Iturralde-Vinent and MacPhee (1999) give an age no older than the Middle Eocene for the Greater Antillean islands (including Cuba and Hispaniola), therefore claiming that that fauna must be younger than this age. On this basis they reject Rosen's (1975) Mesozoic vicariance hypothesis. Although they agree that these island masses may be as old as the Jurassic, they believe that subduction into tectonic nappes, subsidence into the water, thrusting, folding, volcanic activity and K/T bolide impact-related activity make comparisons of present day (or at least post-Eocene) Antillean islands and their Mesozoic precursors meaningless. There are many methods that have been proposed for selecting between biogeographic hypotheses (see Crisci 2001). I adopt a cladistic biogeographic approach sensu Rosen (1978) and Nelson & Platnick (1981). This method was selected over others because it uses area cladograms that can be created from the published phylogenies reviewed here. This method was also selected over others because it is the only one that utilizes the principle of parsimony, which by minimizing assumptions finds the most efficient explanation of the evidence (Sober 1988). The cladistic biogeographic approach assumes a shared correspondence between phylogenetic history and geological history. The relationship between these histories can be seen in congruent patterns of different taxonomic and area cladograms (cladograms with taxon names replaced by distributions) fitting a given pattern of geological history. In this method, dispersal is assumed not to explain a disjunct distribution until vicariance can be falsified (Kluge 1989; Croizat, Nelson & Rosen 1975). Vicariance is a more parsimonious interpretation than dispersal for congruent area cladograms of different taxa, because the congruence can be explained by a single event (i.e., the rifting of a continent or orogeny). The same interpretation of distributions by dispersal would require concordant dispersal in the same sequence for many diverse taxa (Fig. 2, Fig. 3). The essence of vicariance biogeography is that barriers arise secondarily to divide up species. Vicariance events, because they are tied to earth history, can only be supported by a very limited range of phylogenetic patterns. Dispersal scenarios, because they can occur without any underlying congruent process, can be claimed to support an unlimited range of phylogenetic patterns. Area cladograms that fit a hypothesized geographical fragmentation sequence may support vicariance, or at least do not falsify it. All distribution patterns can be explained by dispersal. Dispersal scenarios therefore should not be employed unless vicariance scenarios have been falsified. Vicariance scenarios for freshwater fishes have the following potential falsifiers: (1) the phylogenetic pattern (sequence of lineage divergence) does not follow the timing of known geological processes (i.e. the sequence of fragmentation) (Figure 3), (2) members of particular lineages are younger than hypothesized related vicariance events (3) a species of the group under study is found on either side of a supposed barrier to dispersal (4) molecular clocks or sequence divergence times reliably show that lineages have diverged after the particular vicariant events under study. Dispersal will be the favored mechanism to explain a disjunct distribution when falsifiers of vicariance - by adding assumptions to a vicariance hypothesis - make dispersal a more parsimonious alternative. The possibility also exists that the current evidence is insufficient to select between alternative explanations of disjunct distributions. Specimens were purchased from an aquarist company, Tangled Up In Cichlids or from specimens that were bought from Michigan pet stores by the author. Specimens have yet to be vouchered and officially placed in the UMMZ (Univeristy of Michigan Museum of Zoology) collections. Photographic records of the left side of the included fishes were taken before tissue samples were removed. Molecular sequences were obtained from the University of Michigan Sequencing Core after DNA purification and amplification were completed by the author. Additional sequences were obtained from GenBank. Table 1 lists the species used in this study and tissue voucher numbers and GenBank accession numbers. Outgroups included members of Labridae (wrasses), the possible sister group to Cichlidae (Streelman & Karl 1997). Closely related Indian cichlids in the genus Etroplus were included to verify monophyly of the Neotropical species. Tissue was preserved in 70% ethanol and frozen at -20�C prior to DNA extraction. DNA was extracted from fin clips, or from muscle tissue from the right side of the specimen using Proteinase K dissolution. Tissue was then purified using a Qiagen Tissue Extraction Kit following the manufactures protocol. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) was performed using Platnium Taq polymerase following the manufactures protocol to amplify about 600 base pairs (bp) of 16S ribosomal subunit and a 650 bp segment of cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI). The primers 16S ar-L 5'-CGCCTGTTTATCAAAACAT-3' and 16S br-H 5'-CCGGTCTGAACTCAGATCAGT-3' (Koucher et al.1989; Palumbi 1996) were used to amplify 16S. The primers LCO1490 5'-GGTCAACAAATCATAAAGATATTGG-3' and HCO2198 5'-TAAACTTCAGGGTGACCAAAAAATCA-3' from Folmer et al. (1994) were used to amplify CO1. Amplification for 16S were carried out in 30 cycles according to the following protocol denaturing for 2 minutes at 95�C, annealing at 55�C for 1 minute and an extension for 2 minutes at 72�C, with an additional terminal extension for 72�C for 10 minutes. Amplification for COI was carried out in 35 cycles to the following temperature profile: denaturing for 20 seconds at 95�C, annealing for 1 minute at 45�C and an extension for 2 minutes at 72�C, with an additional terminal extension for 72�C for 10 minutes. Sequences were aligned (using complete alignment option) and compiled in CLUSTAL X (Thompson et al. 1994). Indels were treated as missing characters in all analyses. Parsimony and Maximum likelihood analyses were carried out in PAUP* 4.0b3 (Swafford, 1998). Heuristic searches were carried out with 1000 replicates (random addition of taxa, ACCTRAN optimization). For maximum likelihood 100 replicate heuristic was done and the assumption set is as follows: the transition/transversions rate was set as 2:1; base frequencies were set to empirical frequencies; for the variable sites option, equal rates for all sites option was selected; starting values for all parameters was parsimony based approximations, Rogers-Swafford method was selected for starting branch lengths. Twenty 16S rDNA sequences were obtained by the author and 22 from GenBank (Table 1). Unfortunately no cichlid COI sequences for the taxa used in this study are available on GenBank. Figure 3 shows the strict consensus parsimony tree of the 16S data alone. Total tree length was of 856 steps. Although the Neotropical taxa are shown to be monophyletic with a bootstrap support of 80, and cichlids are monophyletic with a support of 68, there is very little resolution within the Neotropical clade. There are two possible explanations for the resolution, that either this molecule is unable to resolve this level of divergence or that the species tree is a hard polytomy. Given that the combined data set of both 16S and COI genes are better resolved, it cannot be concluded that these species relationships is an irresolvable hard polytomy. Figure 4, shows the resulting consensus tree of a maximum parsimony heuristic analysis of 1000 bootstraps. Central and North American species form a monophyletic group that includes the Greater Antillean species. This entire clade is nested within the South American clade. Cichlidae and the Neotropical cichlids are found to be monophyletic. The Antillean cichlids do not form a clade. The Cuban Nandopsisramsedeni is found to be sister to a subclade of Mexican and Central American species and the Hispaniolan species Cichlasoma haitiensis is in the poorly resolved grouping outside of the clade that includes N. ramsedeni. The consistency index is 0.471963 and the retention index 0.567878. Figure 5 shows the maximum likelihood tree, which is largely congruent with the parsimony tree. The Mexican and Central American species still form a clade nested with the South American clade. A major distinction is the position of the Greater Antillean species. Cichlasoma haitiensis is recovered as sister to C. oblongus a Guatemalan species; Nandopsis ramsedeni is recovered in a similar position to where it was in the parsimony analysis as sister to a larger clade of Central and Mexican cichlids. Unfortunately due to the disparity of where the Antillean cichlids were recovered in the likelihood and parsimony analyses, little conclusively can be said in regards to their biogeography. Both analyses (likelihood and parsimony) found that the Antillean cichlids do not form a clade, so it can be stated with certainty that these cichlids are derived from different lineages. The Antillean fauna therefore did not arise from a single ancestral species dispersing across a marine environment or landbridge, or from one species dispersing during a vicariant event. At least two separate dispersal events or ancestors are necessary to explain these data. Since both analyses (Figure 4 and 5) find the Antillean cichlids nested within the Central American clade, these analyses find evidence to falsify the GAARlandia hypothesis of Itturalde and MacPhee (1999). Evidence to support this hypothesis would have been to recover the Antillean cichlids as sister to some South American clades instead of nested within the Mexican-Central American clade. With the Central American clade nested within the South American clade and the Neotropical clade recovered as monophyletic in this and other analyses (Sparks 2001; Farias 2001; Streelman et al. 1998; Zardoya 1996) it is apparent that South American taxa dispersed to Central America to colonize habitats there - fitting the hypotheses of Myers (1938, 1966) and Bussing (1985). Although there is evidence against dispersal across a South American landbridge of cichlids to give rise to the Antillean cichlids, there is no evidence supporting or falsifying the Rosen coalescence hypothesis or overwater dispersal being the mechanism for cichlids getting from Central America to the Greater Antilles. Both scenarios are still plausible. However, the cladistic biogeographic approach uses a simplicity criterion to favor one of these scenarios over the other. Dispersal from Central America across the marine environment given the topologies of these analyses would require that the species that dispersed either speciated on these islands from at least two separate dispersal events, or that the species that currently are on the islands had their source mainland populations subsequently extirpated. There is no fossil record of any Cuban or Hispaniolan species on Central America or vice versa. Interestingly the relationship of the Antillean cichlids rules out successful dispersal events from one island to the other. Not only are there not shared populations of species between the islands, but also the species on Cuba and Hispaniola are not even closely related. That the Antillean cichlids are not monophyletic still fits the Rosen hypothesis of drift vicariance. According to Rosen (1975, 1985) Jamaica, the Caymans, southwest Hispaniola, and western Cuba were connected to different parts of southern and eastern parts of the Yucatan and northern parts of Central America. This scenario would entail different cichlid species giving rise to the separated lineages in Cuba and Hispaniola. The simplest scenario is that of Rosen (1975, 1985) rather than of a dispersalist scenario of overwater dispersal. Given the dispersalist view point cichlids on the Antilles would have had to disperse the hundreds of kilometers from Central America to Hispaniola and Cuba in two separate dispersal events, but not the 77 kilometers between these islands. The vicariance approach requires a unique event, to explain the current Antillean distributions of cichlids, atherinids (silversides), poeciliids and other Cyprinodontiformes, synbranchid eels and gars, since they all have largely congruent cladograms (Rosen 1975; Rauchenberger 1988). The dispersalist scenario assumes each of these lineages independently dispersed from Central America to these islands. There are several interesting non-biogeographic outcomes recovered in the tree topologies that will interest aquarists. Cichlasoma (= Archocentrus) citrenellum is perhaps the most popular aquarium trade cichlid. Three individuals of this species were samples in the analyses. C. citrenellum10 (as labeled in the trees and Table 1) is from a pet store, and has presumable been in the aquarium trade for many generations leaving it susceptible to hybridization with other captive bred species. C. citrenellum1 is an F1 generation from wild caught individuals, and Archocentrus citrenellumAF0490 is a GenBank sequence from this same species reported with its synonomized generic name. The later two individuals are identical but C. citrenellum10 is recovered as forming a sister relationship with Amphillophus lyonsi. Supporting that at least some aquarium populations of this species, sold as the Midas cichlid for its golden color, are hybrids of other species. Another popular aquarium population known as the blue dempsey Nandopsis octofasciatus has been reported in the aquarium literature as a hybrid of two distantly related taxa and not related to the common dempsey Cichlasoma octofasciatus. In these analyses the blue dempsey is found to be identical to individuals reported in GenBank and other populations of dempsey supporting the idea that this population is simply a color morph of the common wild population. Clearly the other Antillean species need to be sampled, as should the COI data from those species from which only 16S data is sampled. Finding that the additional two species from the islands are not related to the two species sampled here would favor a dispersalist scenario over a vicariant one. A vicariance scenario would predict that the ancestor of the species on each island arrived there as part of a single vicariant event and speciated on that islands. A morphological analysis would be useful because the fossil species Cichlasoma woodringi should be included in these analyses, and a morphological study would act as a congruent and independent test of the congruent molecular topologies found here.

BIO.G2.03.1,"Cholera Seasonality, Rainfall, and Fadeouts: a Geostatistical Approach",Biology,Research Paper,"Abstract: The seasonality of cholera and its spatial variability remain unexplained. Uncovering the role of environmental drivers in these seasonal patterns is critical for understanding temporal variability over longer time scales, including trends and variability between years. Rainfall has been proposed as a key driver of the seasonality of cholera. To address this hypothesis, we examine the association between rainfall and cholera is both time and space. We show that historical data for the districts of former British India (1900-1940) cluster into two main regions that differ not just in the effect of rainfall but also in their seasonal pattern and frequency of fadeouts. Results support a previously proposed model of cholera seasonality with two different routes of transmission and a dual nature of rainfall, with both positive and negative effects. We define ""endemic"" and ""epidemic"" cholera regions based on these findings. The seasonality of cholera remains a mystery, it exhibits robust regularity but with important geographic variation. Furthermore, its environmental drivers are poorly defined because the seasonal pattern varies in space, with different lags relative to rainfall, one major potential driver. For example, two peaks per year are the typical pattern described for cholera in Bangladesh and former Bengal, with a decline in the summer during the monsoons, but only one peak is present in other regions of former British India and current Brazil, which coincides with the rainy season (see review by Pascual et al., 2002; and Code�o, 2001). A better understanding of cholera's seasonality is key to identify the regional mechanisms behind the described effect of the El Ni�o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) (Pascual et al., 2000; Koelle and Pascual, 2004). It is also fundamental to build scenarios for cholera with global change. Both climate variability (ENSO) and climate change are likely to act on infectious diseases through the modulation of the seasonal cycle and the crossing of environmental thresholds (Pascual and Dobson, 2005). Studies in volunteers confirmed that the ingestion of a dosage between 107 and 1011 bacteria, depending on the method (for example, neutralizing stomach acidity, or with different foods), develop in an infection (Kaper et al., 1995); consequently, bacteria density is considered a major indicator of potential outbreaks. Moreover, the existence of two possible routes of transmission for cholera includes rainfall in the seasonal cycle of cholera cases. Primary transmission presumably occurs from a reservoir of the pathogen Vibrio cholerae in the aquatic environment. Brackish water and estuaries, has been shown to provide adequate environmental conditions for the bacterium to survive outside the human host (Colwell et al., 1977). Secondary or human-to-human transmission occurs via the ingestion of fecally contaminated water, and some times through food (Glass et al., 1991). The relative importance of these two routes of transmission is highly debated; however, if a strong feedback exists from infected hosts to the natural environments, the distinction between the two is blurred. Based on these two transmission routes, Dobson et al. (in prep.) have previously proposed the following mechanisms behind the bimodal seasonal pattern of cholera in Bangladesh. The first peak occurs in the spring, during the dry season when temperature warms up, because the bacterium thrives in the environment where it is also more highly concentrated, and humans' interaction with water bodies increases (i.e. primary transmission). The monsoon leads to a decline in cholera in the summer, as heavy rainfall dilutes the concentration of the pathogen in the environment and both salinity and pH, favorable conditions for the bacteria, decay. This dilution effect of rainfall represents a negative influence. However, a positive effect would follow with an increase in cholera as humans concentrate in the flooded landscape and existing sanitary conditions break down (i.e. secondary transmission). This seasonal model provides predictions for both endemic and epidemic areas. In endemic regions, cholera should exhibit a negative association with rainfall at zero lag (dilution effect) and a positive correlation at positive lags reflecting the increase in secondary transmission after the rains. However, in regions with long and sustained periods of rainfall, and consequently with low concentration of the pathogen in the aquatic reservoirs, there should be an increase in the local extinction of the disease. Hence, frequent fade-outs and an erratic behavior should be favored in regions with lower human populations. To examine these predictions, we analyze the association of cholera and rainfall in space and time, investigating also the notion of a Critical Community Size for cholera (Keeling, 1997). The predictions conceived from the hypothesis about the temporal dynamics of primary and secondary transmission can be evaluated studying historical records of cholera disease. The area studied was the region of India known as Madras Presidency. The Madras Presidency was a former province of the British Empire that included several districts in the southern region of India between latitudes 20� and 8�N and longitudes 74� and 86�E. We digitized the historical maps of the province and its 26 administrative sub-province divisions or districts, where the included historical districts were: (1) Anatapur, (2) Bellary, (3) Chingleput, (4) Chittoor, (5) Cuddapah, (6)Ganjam, (7) Godivari East, (8) Godivari West, (9) Guntur, (10) Kistna, (11) Kurnool, (12) neighborhood of Madras, the former capital city, (13) Malabar, (14) Nellore, (15) Nilgiris, (16) North Arcot, (17) Ramnad, (18) Salem, (19) South Arcot, (20) South Kanara, (21) Tanjore, (22) Tinnevelly, (23) Vizgapatam, (24) Trichinopoly, (25) Coimbatore and (26) Madua (Fig. 1). For each district, monthly cholera mortality data were collected from January 1892 until December 1940 and, during the same period, information about population size for some of the districts was obtained. In addition, from January 1901 to December 1970, several meteorological stations located in the region collected daily rainfall data. A monthly estimation of rainfall during that period was calculated averaging the stations and taking in consideration the historical borders of the districts. Because of the partial overlapping, analyses considering both data only included the period from January 1901 to December 1940. On the other hand, whenever cholera mortality or rainfall was analyzed independently from each other, the full time series was used (1892-1940 and 1901-1970 respectively). A spatial correlogram (Bailey and Gatrell, 1995, Fortin et al., 2002) was performed to detect up to which amplitude, or distance, the area of influence of each district extends when cholera mortality is the variable under study. With the distance obtained (200 Km.), proximity matrices, that determinate which districts are considered as neighbors, were defined. Once that a neighborhood was defined spatial autocorrelation analyses were performed considering both cholera and rainfall dataset. The well-known (global) spatial autocorrelation index, Moran's I (Cliff and Ord, 1973), and its modified version, which incorporated the computation for local variations, Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA) (Anselin, 1995, Fortin et al., 2002), was obtained for the mean values of both time series. In order to study the interactions between cholera and rainfall the coefficient of correlation between the time series was calculated including a lag between the series ranging from 0 to 12 months (with rainfall preceding cholera). Then, both global and local spatial autocorrelation indexes, using the coefficients of correlation as input, were calculated. Whereas Moran's I evaluates the degree of global clustering, LISA index permits local variations and hence the identification of hot-spots and cold-spots or clusters where high and low values for the interaction cholera-rainfall were observed is possible. Spatial autocorrelation shows a static picture of the distribution of cholera, however, dynamical measures are necessary to have a complete perspective. Two of such measures were considered here: the Critical Community Size and the seasonal variability of rainfall. The Critical Community Size (CCS), the population size below which a disease dies out in the troughs between epidemics, reflects the dynamics underlying outbreaks (Keeling, 1997). Hence, a qualitative measure of the CCS was obtained for the districts were population data was available. For this analysis, a period of at least two consecutive months without mortality was considered a die out of the disease, known as fadeout. In addition, the spatial autocorrelation of the amount of fade-outs also was analyzed. Finally, the incorporation of the dynamic pattern manifested by rainfall fulfills the previous analysis. All the districts exhibited a strong peak in rainfall due to the so-called southwest monsoon (for a detailed explanation see Krishnamurthy and Kinter III, 2002). Some districts exhibit high precipitation values can last for even 6 months, and after such a long rain season the rainfall diminish to irrelevant levels during the rest of the year, whereas in others districts the monsoon effect is typically shorter (3 or 4 months) and a second peak of rainfall occurs within an interval of few months. Exceptions to this second peak are the districts on the Arabian Sea. Determining how many times and for how long the monthly-accumulated rainfall exceeded a threshold value-fixed at a value of 25% over the expected rainfall per district-allowed to discriminate districts with two rainfall peaks per year from those with only one. This characterization of districts was later analyzed considering the variability of cholera observed in conjunction with the rainfall patterns. The methods described in the previous section provide evidence to describe the variability manifested in rainfall, mortality due to cholera, and their interconnection in light of the situations expected by our hypotheses. The low values obtained for the spatial autocorrelation, measured by the global index Moran's I, indicate that there is not significant spatial clustering when both cholera mortality and rainfall are independently considered; however, when Moran's I is evaluated for the correlation between them, the index reaches significance (Table 1). Hence, a notable spatial association emerged when the interconnection between cholera and rainfall was explored. Considering the locality for cholera mortality, the results provided by the LISA index delimited one small-size cluster (districts number 17, 24 and 26) with high values in the central southern part of the region under analysis, and a second cluster close to the first, also small in size (districts 15 and 18) and with low values compared to that in the high-value cluster. In contrast, for rainfall, a medium-size cluster (districts number 4, 5, 11 and 14) of low values appears in the central northern region. As well as the global clustering changes when the correlation between cholera and rainfall is analyzed, the pattern exhibited locally is also dramatically different (Fig. 2): one big-size cluster with high values is formed in the northeast region (districts 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 23, denoted as HIGH-HIGH in the figure); a second big-size cluster with low values is found in the central southern area (districts 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 24, 25 and 26, LOW-LOW); and three one-district clusters with relative low values, respecting their neighborhood, are also delimited (districts 12, 13 and 20). This pattern could be read as follows: In the northeast area, the correlation between rainfall and cholera without considering any temporal lag between the series is reach positive significant values, whereas in the central southern area the values are negative. When the local clustering evaluated with LISA index is studied introducing time lags between cholera and rainfall time series, with rainfall preceding cholera, a similar pattern is obtained when the lag is 10, 11 and 12 months, whereas the pattern is inverted-negative correlation in the northeast region and positive correlation in the central southern area- for values ranging from 3 to 7, and finally the pattern is not clear for 1, 2, 8 and 9 months (Fig. 3 shows some of the lags). Considering the dynamic aspects of this study, the CSS plotted in Figure 4 shows that districts with higher density have a lower number of fadeouts, while in the less dense districts the presence of the disease is frequently interrupted. It is very important to notice the high variability present in the dataset, but in these low populated districts, cholera can be seen as a disease with irregular outbreaks, whereas in the former districts cholera exhibits an endemic behavior. The Moran's I value considering the amount of fadeouts for each district, Table 1, indicates that there is not spatial clustering. Local clustering analysis considering the amount of fadeouts does not reach statistical significance; however, mapping the amount of fadeouts more fadeouts occurs in the northern districts (Fig. 5). A similar geographical pattern is obtained when the duration of fadeouts is considered, with the northern districts having longer fadeouts than the southern ones. Finally, a classification considering the mean annual duration of the rain season determined three different regions (Fig. 5): a northern area with long rain season (districts 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, 15, 20 and 23); a Central area with a moderate length of rainfall (districts 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 11, 12, 14, 16, 19 and 21); and a southern region with two short wet season (districts 17, 18, 22, 24, 25 and 26). The results obtained in this work allow splitting the Madras Presidency into two main regions, Northeastern and Southern, with different cholera seasonality and different patterns of association between cholera and rainfall. In particular, the southern region exhibits a pattern which is similar with the one described in the literature for Bangladesh (Bouma and Pascual, 2001), with the whole seasonal pattern shifted in time in accordance with the earlier dominant monsoon season. This seasonal pattern is then characteristic of endemic regions, with regular and persistent infection, and contrasts with the stochastic nature of epidemic regions with only one sporadic peak coincident with rains and recurrent fadeouts. The northeastern region comprehends the following districts: Godivari East (7), Godivari West (8), Guntur (9), Kistna (10), Kurnool (11), and Vizgapatam (23). In this area, a positive correlation between cholera and rainfall is shown and in general, one epidemic peak of cholera mortality per year is presented. Moreover, these districts display longer and more frequent fadeouts, suggesting a non-permanent presence of the disease. The southern region including the districts of Nilgiris (15), North Arcot (16), Ramnad (17), Salem (18), South Arcot (19),Trichinopoly (24), Coimbatore (25), and Madua (26). In this region, a negative association between cholera and rainfall is observed and two peaks of cholera mortality are commonly shown. Also in this region, shorter and infrequent (sporadic) fadeouts are observed, probably indicating a permanent presence of the disease. The remaining districts (numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 12, 13, 14, 20, 21, 22 and 23 in Fig. 1), located in the central and west regions exhibited an intermediate behavior between the ones presented in the two regions described above. The bimodal Southern pattern is consistent with the predictions of our seasonal model (Dobson et al., in prep). This result provides the first quantitative evidence for both a positive and negative influence of rainfall on the seasonality of cholera, through its dilution effect on the pathogen and its enhancing effect of 'human-to-human' or secondary transmission. While the first effect has been described in the literature, the second is novel for the bimodal cholera pattern. The unimodal monsoonal Northern pattern combined with its stochastic nature suggests that in places where secondary transmission cannot be sustained over time, an environmental reservoir of pathogenic Vibrio cholerae is not effectively maintained. Thus this human feedback from infected individuals to aquatic reservoirs appears critical to sustain the so-called primary transmission, which underscores the importance of secondary transmission itself. Sustained periods of rain further dilute the pathogen in aquatic reservoirs and epidemics occur during the rainy season, presumably through immigration of infected individuals and the consequent secondary route of transmission. Traditionally, the explanation for the occurrence of outbreaks after rainfall periods only considers the environment driven infection processes and basically states that moderate rainfalls are able to create optimal (or quasi optimal) environmental conditions for the spread of Vibrio cholerae (Lipp et al., 2002). The findings presented here supported the hypothesis that a long wet season is able to create a dilution effect avoiding the bacteria to anchor in the environment (Pascual et. al, 2002), but due to the aggregation of people, probably because of floods, which disproportionally raises the human-to-human oral-fecal mechanism of contagion and drastically reduces the quality of sanitary conditions, the disease is able to settle when is introduced from an endemic area. Consequently, rainfall plays two different roles concerning cholera dynamics: short wet seasons favor cholera leading to an environment driven disease, whereas long wet seasons entail an infectious dynamics. In conclusion, the dynamics of cholera can be defined by two very different regions inside the Madras Presidency: the southern endemic region and the northeast region that exhibits an epidemic behavior. A possible explanation for the re-emergence of the disease in epidemic zones can be the migration of infective agents (food, water or people) from the endemic zones. Although more information is necessary to evaluate explicitly such scenario, our findings may be used to design health care polices in order to avoid massive mortality situations.

BIO.G2.04.1,Polyphyly of the Old World Vultures and Phylogenetic Placement of Gypohierax Angolensis (Aves: Accipitridae) Inferred from Mitochondrial DNA,Biology,Research Paper,"The palmnut vulture (Gypohierax angolensis) is a monotypic species found along the coast, estuaries and rivers of sub-Saharan Africa in areas where oil and raffia palms also occur. This vulture is relatively common but not abundant in Mozambique and rare in northern Zululand, Botswana and Zimbabwe; it is considered South Africa's rarest breeding bird. The diet of Gypohierax largely consists of palm fruits, but also includes many fish, crabs, snails and other small animals, as well as other birds. (Ginn et al., 1989) An alternative name of Gypohierax is the vulturine fish eagle (Ginn et al., 1989), reflecting its many similarities, both dietary and morphological (especially talon structure), to the sea and fish eagles (genus Haliaeetus). The phylogenetic placement and evolutionary history of Gypohierax is unclear. Brown and Amadon (1968) included Gypohierax as a member of a monophyletic clade of Old world vultures, but also suggested a sister relationship between the sea eagles and Gypohierax . Jollie (1977), Suschkin (1899), and Brown and Amadon (1968) note that Gypohierax resembles the Egyptian vulture (Neophron) and may be a member of a monophyletic clade of all Old World vultures (including Neophron). Holdaway (1994), in a phylogenetic analysis of osteological characters, finds support for a monophyletic clade of vultures where the palmnut vulture is the earliest diverging vulture. Several phylogenetic analyses based on mitochondrial DNA and morphological traits support paraphyly of the Old World vultures (Seibold and Helbig, 1995; Mundy et al., 1992). Two clades are identified: the Gyps-Aegypius-Necrosyrtes clade includes the genera of its name as well as Torgos, Trigonoceps, and Sarcogyps, and is sister to the Snake eagles; and, the Gypaetus-Neophron clade, is sister to Pernis apivorus, including only the two genera for which it is named. Gypohierax is not included in these analyses, but Seibold and Helbig propose that it most likely represents a third independent evolutionary line separate from the other Old World vulture clades. In summary, it has been proposed that Gypohierax (1) forms a clade independent from other vulture lineages, (2) is sister to the sea eagles (Haliaeetus), (3) is a member of a monophyletic clade of Old World vultures, and (4) is most closely related to the Egyptian vulture (Neophron). The Old World vultures have been proposed to be (1) a monophyletic clade, (2) two separate distinct monophyletic clades (overall polyphyly), and (3) three separate distinct monophyletic clades (overall polyphyly). DNA was extracted from tissue and feather samples using the Qiagen DNEasy Extraction kit. An addition of dithiothreitol was used for samples from feathers. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was carried out using two primers pairs for cytochrome B (CytB; Sorenson et al. 1999). PCR and sequencing was done following protocols in Mindell et al. (1997). Additional CytB sequences for analyses were obtained from GenBank (Aegypius monachus, gi 1050567; Trigonoceps occipitalis, gi 1050710; Sarcogyps calvus, gi 1050699, Gypaetus barbatus, gi 1050621; and Neophron percnopterus, gi 1050666). Conceptually translated protein sequences were aligned by eye and this alignment was imposed on the nucleotides. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted using parsimony and maximum likelihood (ML) criteria for the dataset. For parsimony analysis, a bootstrap analysis was done using Winclada software (Nixon, 2002), 1000 replications with 100 search reps and ten starting trees per rep. A Bayesian inference (BI) approach, which is related to ML analyses, (Mau et al., 1999; Yang and Rannala) was performed with Metropolis-coupled Markov chain Monte Carlo, or (MC)3, to approximate the posterior probabilities (PP) of the trees in MrBayes 2.1 (Huelsenbeck and Ronquist). Bayesian inference has advantages over other methods of phylogenetic inference in interpretation of results, consistency (Wilcox et al.) and computational speed (Larget and Simon); however, as always, reliability of the results depends on appropriateness of the model, and some simulations have demonstrated artifactually high PP support values (Suzuki et al., 2002). Base frequencies and gamma distribution (with eight rate categories) were estimated each run. A general time reversible model was used, which includes six substitution types. The search was run twice, starting from random trees with four simultaneous Markov chains, sampling every 50 generations for 1,000,000 generations. The proportion of searches in which any given node (set of relationships) is found during the chain is an approximation of its PP, and provides an indication of support for that node based on the dataset. The sequence data set of 1017 nucleotides from 27 species aligned with no indels or stop codons. Of the 1017 nucleotide positions, 458 were variable and 339 were parsimony informative. Each amino acid is coded for by up to six different codons (synonymous codons). The relative frequency of each synonymous codon should be equal to that of the its related synonymous codons if none of the codons are favored by selection or mutation. However, many organisms have been found to have biases in synonymous codon usage (Sharp et al., 1988). Codon bias was also found in this data set of Accipitridae for most amino acids (table 1). The largest biases were found in valine (V) and serine (S), where one codon was at least three times more frequent than expected. Synonymous substitutions (10815 occurrences) were observed ten times more often than nonsynonymous substitutions (1060 occurrences). The parsimony analysis shows polyphyly of the Old World vultures based on the cyt b dataset (Figure 1). Sarcogyps, Trigonoceps and Aegypius form a sister clade to Necrosyrtes and Gyps. There is strong support for the existence of two sister clades (95 boostrap value), but weak support for the placement of species within these clades. Circaetus remains part of an unresolved polytomy not within this derived vulture clade. The remaining three vultures Neophron, Gypaetus and Gyophierax form a much earlier diverging unresolved polytomy. The Bayesian analysis shows polyphyly of the Old World vultures based on the cyt b dataset (Figure 2). Neophron, Gypaetus and Gyophierax form an early diverging monophyletic clade sister to Pernis, while the other Old World vultures form a much more derived monophyletic clade. Support for the early diverging clade of vultures is moderate (74 PP). The more derived vulture clade consists of two sister groups, one formed by Trigonoceps, Aegypius and Sarcogyps, and the other including Gyps, and Necrosyrtes. Support for the monophyly of this clade is high (95 PP), as is support for the existence of two clades within the derived vulture clade (100 PP) Circaetus is sister to the derived clade of vultures with moderate support (85 PP). Both the Bayesian and ML analyses support polyphyly of the Old World vultures based on this cyt b dataset. The analyses agree that the more derived vultures form a monophyletic clade consisting of two sister groups as found by Seibold and Helbig (1995). The first group includes Sarcogyps as the earliest diverging species, then Trigonoceps and finally Aegypius as the most derived species in this group. The second group has Necrosyrtes as sister to the Gyps pecies. These results coincide for the most part with the anlyses done by Seibold and Helbig, however, they support a sister relationship between Necrosyrtes and Gyps not found by Seibold and Helbig. The Bayesian analysis suggests that Gypohierax , Neophron and Gypaetus form a monophyletic clade of early diverging vultures sister to a species long-supposed to be early diverging: Pernis. The sister relationship between Gypaetus and Neophron was supported by Seibold and Helbig's analysis and is reflected in shared morphological, embryonic development, vocalizations and feeding behavior characteristics of the two species. AlthoughNeophron and Necrosyrtes have been considered closely related, they are best considered in terms of convergence according to this analysis (White, 1950). The placement of Circaetus although unresolved in the ML analysis, is potentially sister to the derived vulture group as it is shown in the Bayesian analysis. This placement was proposed by Mundy et al. {, 1992}, although not supported by Seibold and Helbig's cyt b analysis. Mundy et al. also suggested a sister relationship for Circaetus and Terathopius. Both genera specialize on snakes as prey and have morphological adaptations for this lifestyle. Given the convergence seen between Neophron and Necrosyrtes in this analysis, it remains uncertain if Circaetus and Terathopius are sister or convergent species. The placement of Gypohierax is supported strongly by the Bayesian analysis, as sister to the Gypaetus--Neophron early diverging clade of vultures. A sister relationship between Gypohierax and Neophron was suggested by Brown and Amadon (1968), but has not been tested before with molecular evidence. Osteological evidence suggests a sister relationship between Gypohierax , and Aegypius, Gyps, and Necrosyrtes that was not supported with this cyt b dataset (Holdaway, 1994). If Gyophierax is truly sister to Gypaetus and Neophron, as suggested by this dataset, this relationship may help identify morphological characters that are convergent in many of the Old World vultures which have led to misplacement and confusion in previous phylogenetic analyses of vultures.

BIO.G3.01.1,Do Programming-Oriented Environments Provide Favorable Growing Conditions for Hypotheses?,Biology,Research Paper,"As Platt (1964) argued, hypothesis-testing is essential to rapid scientific progress, with dispositive studies guiding it efficiently along a logical tree akin to a chemist's flow chart or conditional computer program. Moreover, this strong inference approach attains its greatest efficiency when multiple alternative hypotheses are tested simultaneously, enabling researchers to quickly eliminate fruitless branches of the logical tree (Platt 1964). Now that many ecologists rely upon computer programming to generate models and run simulations, the question arises of whether such experience in constructing parsimonious sequences of conditional propositions has promoted the use by these scientists of a hypothesis-testing approach in their empirical ecological investigations. Furthermore, because scientific investigation is strongly influenced by the culture in which it is embedded (Kuhn 1970), perhaps even ecologists who do not themselves engage in programming-aided theoretical studies would nevertheless display heightened hypothesis-testing if they are affiliated with institutions that emphasize computer reliant theoretical research. Based upon these considerations, I propose the Programming Promotes Hypothesis-Testing Hypothesis (PPHTH), which states that ecologists occurring in habitats in which computer-aided theoretical modeling is emphasized should show increased frequency, rigor, and efficiency of hypothesis testing when compared with ecologists from other milieus. In the present paper, as a test of this hypothesis, I compare empirical ecological research produced at an institution that places an extremely high emphasis upon computer-assisted, theoretical studies with empirical ecological studies emanating from a more broad-based institution. For the computer-rich environment, I chose the University of Chicago's Department of Ecology and Evolution (Chicago), home to a self-styled naturalist publication in which the most frequently studied species are named x and y, and in which a computer monitor passes for an observation blind. Moreover, this university served as Platt's intellectual home, as he was a professor there (Platt 1964) and, as a whole, it has historically been steeped in theory, from Fermi in physics to Friedman in finance. I compared research of ecologists who are Chicago professors with research produced by ecologists who are professors of the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor ( Michigan). The latter institution, while certainly strong in ecological theory, does not, unlike the former, place such a strong emphasis on computer programming that its graduate school application largely comprises an assessment of such skills (Rosenthal, pers. obs.). In other respects, however, the institutions are similar, especially in that they both have highly prominent ecological research programs. For Chicago, I visited the Department of Ecology and Evolution web page listing faculty research areas (http://pondside.uchicago.edu/ecol-evol/research/), identifying as ecologists all those professors listed under the Ecology heading. For Michigan, my search similarly started at the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology website listing faculty research interests (http://www.eeb.lsa.umich.edu/eebfaculty.asp). However, because this site did not have a separate list for ecology or ecologists, I identified as ecologists those professors for whom the word ecology appeared in the description of their field of interest. For both sites, sampling was conducted in February, 2002. After the ecologists were identified, ecological publications were selected in the following manner: I visited each ecologist's individual web page, and went through his or her posted list of publications in reverse chronological order (with publication titles within the same year examined in alphabetical order), up to and including 1997, if necessary, until one suitable publication title was encountered. Publications were excluded if they were books rather than journal articles; or if they were not available either online or at the Shapiro Science Library; or if their titles reflected material that was either not ecological in nature (e.g., single species ethological studies); or clearly not explanatory in nature (e.g., an account of fish recruitment rates) or purely theoretical, without an empirical component. For some of the ecologists, no suitable publication was found, and therefore these individuals were not represented in the study. Because of the frequent changes in institutional affiliations prevalent in academia, it is quite likely that some of the publications selected in the above manner were written, submitted or published prior to the ecologist's affiliation with their current institution. However, I decided that this should not preclude the inclusion of such publications in the current study, because: 1) their current institutions presumably selected faculty who reflected their own institutional cultures; and 2) the faculty members presumably chose institutions that encouraged their own approaches. Therefore, the different degrees of emphasis on theoretical approaches, and the predicted consequences for hypothesis testing should be reflected even in such prior publications. Co-authorship of papers was not a bar to their inclusion in the study, as elimination of studies having multiple authors would have reduced the number of reviewed articles to an unworkably small number (quite close to zero). Moreover, as co-authored studies were included from both institutions, this approach should not affect the outcome of a comparison between the two. For the purposes of this study, the hypothesis testing process was defined as containing the following four essential elements: 1) proposal of an a priori hypothesis (a posteriori hypotheses being excluded here because, by definition, they are not tested within the published studies within which they appear); 2) formulation of at least one factual prediction predicated upon this hypothesis, such that results contrary to the prediction would necessitate rejection of the hypothesis; 3) performance of a test to determine whether the prediction is borne out; and 4) comparison of the test's results to those predicted by the hypothesis, yielding a conclusion that the hypothesis has accordingly been rejected or supported. In operationalizing the four elements outlined above, I emphasized substance, rather than form, such that: The hypothesis-testing activity in the two populations of publications was assessed with respect to frequency, rigor, and efficiency as follows: For each publication, the presence or absence of each of the four functional elements was recorded. Only those publications having all four present were classified as hypothesis-testing (HT). I then computed the proportion of the total that were HT. If PPHTH were to obtain, the HT proportion should be higher in the Chicago than the Michigan sample. Each publication was examined to determine if it purported to evaluate hypotheses (i.e., by explicitly making this assertion). For each institution, the proportion of such publications that also qualified as HT was then computed. This approach was undertaken in order to evaluate the relative success of the two institutions in achieving hypothesis testing when explicitly attempted. If PPHTH were to obtain, the proportion of rigorous studies should be higher in the Chicago than the Michigan sample. Each HT publication was examined to determine if it tested multiple alternative hypotheses (MAHs) was computed. For a publication to be designated as testing MAHs, it would need to have two or more non-null a priori hypotheses (as defined above) with each of them tested pursuant to the criteria listed above. I then computed the proportion of the HT publications that tested MAHs. If PPHTH were to obtain, the MAH proportion should be higher for the Chicago than the Michigan studies. The individual evaluations of the selected studies are presented in Table 1. TABLE 1. Ecological studies from Chicago and Michigan assessed for purported and successful hypothesis-testing; and for testing multiple alternative hypotheses The group comparisons for hypothesis-testing assays are displayed in Table 2. As Table 2 shows, whereas the values for hypothesis-testing frequency are the same for the two samples, those for both rigor and efficiency are higher in the Chicago sample. TABLE 2. Comparative values of hypothesis-testing indices for Chicago and Michigan studies The results of this study provide limited support, at most, for PPHTH. Although there was a higher efficiency value for the Chicago publications, this was simply due to the fact that its only hypothesis-testing article evaluated multiple alternative hypotheses. It would be an over-generalization - based solely upon this single episode of MAH evaluation - to characterize the Chicago ecologists, as a whole, as more efficient in their hypothesis-testing. On the other hand, the difference in the values for the rigor index is more likely to reflect an actual disparity between the ways in which ecological research is framed at the two institutions. Although at both departments only one out of the five reviewed studies met all the hypothesis-testing criteria, at Michigan a majority (3 of 5) of publications asserted that they were evaluating hypotheses. At Chicago, in contrast, the only study to mention hypotheses was the one that actually tested them. There, 3 of the remaining 4 studies (Dwyer et al. 1998; Pfister 1998; Wootton 2001) focused instead upon the parameterization of mathematical models. Thus, the institutional difference in rigor values might be due to the Michigan ecologists more frequently attempting to fit their research into a hypothesis-testing framework (whether justified or not) - whereas the bulk of Chicago research addresses simulations and other mathematical manipulations. The one prediction of PPHTH that clearly was not borne out was that of a higher frequency of hypothesis-testing in the Chicago publications. Instead, the frequency was identically low for both institutions, due perhaps to Chicago ecologists largely eschewing hypothesis-testing in favor of more purely theoretical investigations, while Michigan ecologists tackled topics that are of such scale that they pose practical obstacles to adequate testing (e.g., Pascual et al. 2000 ; Vandermeer et al. 2000). In conclusion, the results of the present study suggest that although a programming-oriented environment does not increase the frequency of hypothesis-testing, it does reduce the frequency with which it is claimed, thereby increasing its apparent rigor. Additionally, this environment might increase the efficiency of hypothesis-testing, but this effect is far from clear.

BIO.G0.31.1, Neurobiology Disease Explanation to a Parent,Biology,Response Paper,"� �Dear Dad, I'm so sorry to hear that Mr. and Mrs. Friedson's son, Brian, has been diagnosed with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. Muscular Dystrophy is an inherited disease that causes a person's muscle fibers to be highly susceptible to damage, and over time, these muscles become weaker. Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, in particular, is the most severe of the nine types of muscular dystrophies, and it affects voluntary muscles (muscles used to purposefully move body parts), the heart, and breathing muscles. As is the case with most DMD sufferers, Brian is male and was diagnosed early in his life (most are diagnosed between the ages of 2 and 6). He exhibited general weakness in his hips, pelvis, thighs, and shoulders, and his calves were enlarged. He fell frequently and had difficulty getting up, running, and jumping. Mr. And Mrs. Friedson said that he had a waddling-like gait and wondered if he suffered from mild mental retardation. He was officially diagnosed with DMD following genetic testing and a muscle biopsy (where some of his muscle cells were removed and observed with a microscope). Prior to that, the doctors may have developed a suspicion of muscular dystrophy using blood tests, ultrasound, and electromyography. The majority of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy patients are male because DMD is a recessive trait carried on the X chromosome. Chromosomes are the small units of genetic material that carry traits, and half of a person's chromosomes come from each of their parents. Thus, each person has two copies of genetic material for each trait. Recessive traits, like DMD, are only observed if both copies of the gene carry the recessive trait. However, the genes that determine gender, the X and Y-chromosomes, carry different genes. Males have one X and one Y-chromosome, but females have two X-chromosomes. Thus, if a male gets the recessive trait on the X-chromosome from his mother, he will express it. Females, on the other hand, will only express it if both copies of the trait (one X-chromosome from her mother and one X-chromosome from her father) are recessive. Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy is caused by the absence of functional dystrophin, which is the result of this recessive trait. Dystrophin is a protein (a functional molecule in the body) that is needed by muscle cells for structural support. More specifically, dystrophin helps to anchor the internal cellular cytoskeleton (which is like a skeleton for the cell) to the surface membrane of the cell. Without dystrophin, the cell membrane, which is usually only permeable to water and specific other substances, allows other things to pass through as well. When this foreign matter enters the cell, the cell increases in internal pressure and explodes, which destroys the muscle cell-by-cell, essentially piece-by-piece. DMD will probably kill Brian in his late teens or early 20s from problems with his heart or lungs. Although there is no cure, current medications (including prednisone) and therapies can slow the progression of the disease. In addition, current research on mice is promising and may lead to the development of more effective therapies in the future.

BIO.G1.08.2,Drosophila neuroblasts,Biology,Response Paper,"Although spatial patterning is well studied, but we know little about the mechanism underlying the sequential generation of different cell types. Utilizing various molecular markers and immunostaining in Drosophila, this paper showed that neural precursors sequentially express the transcription factors Hunchback(Hb)->Kruppel(Kr)->Pdm->Castor(Cas). Besides, the authors of this paper demonstrated that Hb and Kr were necessary and sufficient for first-born and second-born cell fates respectively. Furthermore, their functions were observed in several lineages and were independent of cell type involved. First of all, the authors identified Kr as a new deep layer transcription factor and showed the expression pattern of the four transcription factors. They found that Hb, Kr, Pdm and Cas were sequentially and transiently expressed in neuroblasts. Then they demonstrated that these transient expressed transcription factors maintained for a period of time in their neural progeny. They characterized three model neuronblast to prove that, including an early forming neuroblast(7-1) and two late-forming neuroblasts(7-3 and 2-4). Moreover, they found that the gene expression of these transcription factors was not correlated to a particular cell type. Besides, they did experiments to see whether Hb and Kr were necessary and sufficient for specifying first-born and second-born cell fates, respectively. They showed that in hb- neuroblast 7-3 lineage, the number of GMC-2 doubled at the expense of 1/1G neurons or first-born 1/1G neurons were specifically lost. In contrast, in neuroblast 7-3 that continuously expressed Hb, all neurons exhibit first-born 1/1G fates. These findings implied that Hb was indeed not only necessary but also sufficient for specifying first-born cell fates. In addition, they examined the effect of Hb on first-born motoneuron fate in multiple neuroblast lineages, including lineage 1-1 and 4-2. They found that the phenotypes of hb- were consistent with a transformation of GMC-1 to a later-born GMC fate while continuously expressing Hb produced duplications or triplications of first-born cell fate. They also observed a reduction in the number of motoneuron projections in hb- and an increase in the number of motoneurons in neuroblast that continuously expressing Hb. Furthermore, they also examined the effect of Hb on first-born glial cell fates. The hb- mutants lacked first-born MM-CB glia at the midline, but have no change in the number of later-born channel glia at the midline. In contrast, misexpression of Hb in all neuroblasts resulted in extra MM-CB glia at the midline and a decrease in the number of midline channel glia. The results above suggested that Hbs regulation on first-born cell fate was independent of cell type identity. In addition, the authors showed that Kr was necessary and sufficient for second-born cell fates. In neuroblast 7-3 lineage, Kr- had variably effects on first-born 1/1G sibling neurons and second-born interneuron 2 was almost always missing while the third-born interneuron 3 was almost always normal. In contrast, continuously expressing Kr resulted in all but two GMC-1 neurons differentiate as GMC-2 derived interneuron 2. In 7-1 lineage, Kr mutants frequently missed one of the U3/U4 motoneurons while continuously expressing Kr leaded to extra Eve+ neurons with all differentiating as U3 or U4 motoneurons except the normal pair of early-born U1/U2 motoneurons. Last, the authors examined the regulatory interaction between Hb, Kr, Pdm and Cas expression by overexpressing each transcription factor and observing whether gene expression of the other had an increase or decrease. They showed that each gene can activate the next gene in the pathway and repress the next plus one gene. Generally speaking, I think the paper is fairly convincing in demonstrating the effect of Hb and Kr. However, it has some weak points. First, the paper does not provide enough evidences to support the whole sequential Hb->Kr-> Pdm->Cas expression in neuroblasts. Besides, some figures seemed not so clear. For instances, in fig1b, the cell pattern seems a mosaic and can hardly tell the layer. So it might be difficult to tell which cell groups change the gene expression during different time period. In fig5I, I can not see the striking increase in the number of motoneurons. Last, the finding that regulation of Hb and Kr is independent of cell type identity might not be so surprising because at the start of differentiation, those cells might still not have cell type identity. The paper leaves many interesting questions. For instance, as the paper mentioned, the four transcription factors examined were not necessary for driving sequential gene expression. Then what is the driving mechanism underlying this sequential expression? Besides, the temporal gene expression pattern in neuroblasts is very similar to the spatial gene expression pattern at cellular blastoderm. Is there any relation between these two pattern?

ENG.G0.02.1,The Vicar of Wakefield as a Failed Morality Story,English,Argumentative Essay,"Morality stories and plays that espouse Christian values have been incredibly popular in the history of English literature. In The Vicar of Wakefield, Oliver Goldsmith presents a narrator who gives an account of the events that transpire in his family with a, nearly overbearing at times, critical voice that points out Christian morality in every section of his story. These morals, however, or not necessarily Christian, and are certainly different than the morals we see portrayed in older Christian morality stories, such as Everyman, which is a 15th century morality play. Though the narrator attempts to impose morals on every part of the tale he describes, the Vicar of Wakefield is ultimately a failed Christian morality story, as the plot of the story and the action of the characters fail to portray the importance of Christian morals, and the morals it does convey are often conflicted. A Christian morality story, in the sense that I will be using it, is defined as a story that seeks to teach the reader lessons about the importance of Christian morals. Almost every story ever written has a moral; colloquially this term has become synonymous with the idea of a take home message that the author of a text is attempting to impart on the reader. The phrase, the moral of the story, has arisen from a tradition of using stories to teach morals. In the later Middle Ages, around the late 15th and early 16th centuries, morality plays were incredibly common and popular in England. Morality plays often involve characters that are representative of larger social groups, abstract ideas, or objects. In the play Everyman, the protagonist is a character named Everyman who discovers he must die and has to fight off his old sins in the form of characters to be redeemed in God's eyes when he is judged. The play is incredibly heavy-handed with its moralseven God is a character that spouts his judgments out to the watching crowds. The morals that this play, and most morality plays, portray are quite different from what we see in the Vicar of Wakefield. As Everyman approaches heaven alone in the eyes of God, it teaches the reader that all men are truly alone in responsibility for their sins. Everyman must learn to turn away from his love of friends, goods, and spirits in order to redeem himself. The play imparts Christian morals in a harsh, stark way. Its main lesson is that man stands alone before the eyes of God. The lessons that morality plays espouse continue throughout literature even after their popularity fades. In Shakespeare's King Lear we are presented with a tale of a man who is destroyed by making poor choices and loving the wrong people. There is no redemption for Lear, who dies at the end of the play alone in his suffering before God. We can see a clear shift from this type of morality story, one in which a lone protagonist is stripped of everything he owns and must die and face the wrath of God, to the kind of attempted morality story that we see in The Vicar of Wakefield. In this new kind of story, we have a protagonist who is literally constantly surrounded by others, and rather than the judgment of God, we see the judgment of the narrator on all those around him. The narrator's judgmental nature is what leads the Vicar of Wakefield toward failure in its moral delivery. This judgmental air signifies a different kind of storyone in which the individual's life choices and events have become just as significant as the events in his afterlife. In the Vicar of Wakefield, judgment is something that occurs during this lifetime, with punishment coming in the form of poverty and reward in the form of wealth. This is precisely why The Vicar of Wakefield fails to be a true Christian moral story. Though the narrator continually criticizes a love of wealth, saying, the nakedness of the indigent world may be cloathed from the trimmings of the vain, when his wife and daughters attempt to dress up for church, we do not see this sentiment echoed in the action of the play. The wife and daughters never give up their love of finery, as a few weeks later they are at it again, asking to ride the horses to church, and are in the end rewarded by being married to rich men. This is incredibly different from the reward of death and renewal in God's love that we see in morality plays. It is interesting that the narrator of this novel seems so convinced that he and his family are the perfect embodiment of Christian ideals. His wife seems more conniving that pious. London is the only place in the world for husbands. &as Ladies of quality are so taken with my daughters, what will not men of quality be! She is the very embodiment of Mrs. Bennett from Jane Austin's Pride and Prejudice, and all of her meddling is rewarded in the end of the novel when her daughters are married to rich husbands. Charles, the narrator, is continually over-ridden and controlled by the whims of his family, rather than being the traditional stern and controlling father figure that is presented in most Christian tales. He is also given to moments of uncontrollable inaction. He finds himself unable to save his daughter as she is drowning in a river, and when he goes to rescue Olivia when she runs away he is waylaid for three weeks with illness. His inaction does not belie a kind of Christian fortitude to do what is right, and he is never punished for his inaction. Even, the unfortunate Moses was deceived (84). This is quite unlike the biblical Moses, who had the clairvoyance to be able to perceive the voice of God. He saw past the pharaoh's tricks in order to save his people. Moses Wakefield was not even able to see through the tricks of a common thief at market to help his family. The family is clearly lacking in Christian morals and strengths, and rather than atoning for this, they go through hardship only to be rewarded with wealth in the form of marriage to wealthy men. Rather than poverty being a blessing that allows them to live closer to God, as it is in when Everyman casts away his goods, it is an ordeal that they must live through and are rewarded for surviving by the acquiring of vast wealth. The business of wedding transactions is akin to winning the lottery plus a Get Out of Jail Free card to the Wakefield family. The moral lesson that we see here is, endure poverty, be good to those around you, and God will reward you with vast material riches. This is quite different from the reward of God's eternal love that Everyman and Lear receive after their deaths. This is not to say, however, that The Vicar of Wakefield is completely devoid of morals. Rather, this story serves to show us how Christian morals are changing with society. Perhaps due to a rising middle class and exchange of goods an idea of reciprocity has entered Christianity. We can still see that an idea of giving to God without expecting in return is upheld in the vicar's exhortations, yet there is also a new idea that, Former benevolence [will be] repaid with unexpected interest (184). So, perhaps the morals haven't changed so much as the timeline seems to have changedreciprocity can happen in this life or the next. We can see characters making larger strides to prove that they are doing good deeds, that they merit have wealth in their lives because of their good deeds. &never was the family of Wakefield known to turn the traveler or poor dependent out of doors, (38) the narrator tells us, and indeed he spends the entire first chapter explaining his families goodness, benevolence, and charity. There is clearly a sentiment that one must justify ones wealth, or to say, one's wealth is a result of one's charity. In short, moral good is rewarded in this life as well as in the next. There is also an interesting sense that to be an upstanding, moral person one must be educated. This could be due to the rising importance of the marriage market within the middle class, however it is cited many times within the book that the women are able to read, and that this fact improves their worth. I armed her against the censures of the world, shewed her that books were sweet unreproaching companions to the miserable, and that if they could not bring us to enjoy life, they would at least teach us to endure it (140). This shows a changed attitude about the morality of books. Previously we have seen a trend in literature toward viewing books as agents of evil and subversion. Books were to be feared. Yet this clearly shows that the vicar views books to be protective against ignorance. To him, they are something helpful he wishes to share with his daughter to help her through difficulty. Books are an aide that can lead Olivia back when she has gone astray. The only reference we see in The Vicar of Wakefield to the older idea that books are somewhat subversive is in the first chapter. The narrator tells us that his wife, During her pregnancy had been reading romances, [and] insisted upon [the name] Olivia (39). This seems to have a negative connotation, as the narrator later insists that he, had no hand in it (39). Books clearly still have some of their negative connotation, in that they still seem to be seen to have the power to subvert or take control of the reader's mind in a forceful way, yet overall it seems that books have lost most of their negative connotation and are viewed as healthy, moral objects. The final conflicted moral that the book attempts to teach is that one must be loyal to one's family in order to be a moral person. The narrator spends countless pages exhorting his family and his love for his family. The book ends with the narrator, seeing all [his] family assembled once more by a cheerful fireside (199). It is clear that he sees nothing more perfect in life than a happy, loyal family. Yet is the narrator's family loyal? Olivia runs away from home, which, at the time, was a grievous insult to her families honor. In fact, there is little she could have done that would have been less loyal to her family. She even gets married behind their backs. Also, the father shows very little regard for his family when he stays in jail to prove his point against Mister Thornhill even after he hears that Olivia is dying and that it is tearing his family apart. Is his prideone of the seven deadly sinsmore important than his family? The actions of these two characters create conflict in what is the story's most heavily emphasized moral. It is clear that The Vicar of Wakefield does not fit in with earlier Christian morality stories, as it doesn't emphasize the same morals, and it even refutes several of the moral lessons taught by morality plays such as Everyman. It is also unclear as to its own moral message, while still obviously trying to impart a strong one. While the plot of the story and the actions of the characters show an interesting shift in ideas surrounding morality and Christianity around a time when the middle class was rising in England, it does not do an effective job of explaining what these new morals are. In this sense, The Vicar of Wakefield fails as a true Christian morality story.

ENG.G0.03.1,HIV-AIDS Funding,English,Argumentative Essay,"At the end of 2006, over 39.5 million people were living with HIV globally. The year saw over 4.3 million new infections, with over one-third of HIV-AIDS cases in sub-Saharan Africa, the epicenter of the pandemic (Global). On a continent where two-thirds of the population lives on less that one or two dollars a day, the disease devastates poor communities (World Vision International). Because HIV/AIDS can infect anyone (not just the young, elderly, and sick), the disease frequently infects middle-aged people in vital societal positions. These people then can no longer function as agricultural workers, health-care providers, and teachers within communities (World Vision Aids Experience). The United States, along with the Group of Eight leading industrialized countries, should increase funding for the development of HIV-AIDS-educated, sustainable communities in Africa and globally to combat the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Educated, sustainable communities will stabilize the pandemic by creating environments where those affected by HIV/AIDS have the necessary resources to combat the disease successfully. Currently, the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) is fighting the battle against the disease. UNAIDS is an organization of ten smaller United Nations groups. The organization does much of its work creating action plans for leading industrialized nations to follow to combat the disease. UNAIDS presented a plan to stabilize and eventually even phase out HIV/AIDS in 2005 (Schroering). This plan, titled the Universal Access Plan, discusses the current needs of the countries most seriously affected by the pandemic. The Universal Access Plan outlines the necessary monetary support needed to combat HIV/AIDS globally, including a tiered system to yearly increase the amount of funding for HIV/AIDS. The underlying theory of the plan is that if the appropriate amount of financial support is received, HIV/AIDS could be so effectively subdued that infection rates would stabilize and begin to taper, eventually even diminishing. The tiered system would provide complete funding for all necessary programs to stabilize infection rates by 2015, totaling approximately 100 billion US dollars of funding (Financial 13). The necessary programs envisioned would include traditional programs that provide medicine, food, and sexual education, in addition to more innovative programs targeting some root-issues exacerbating the disease: sustainable community development for communities ravaged by HIV-AIDS, and education programs targeted at the myths and stigmas that surround and attribute to spread of the disease. While the work UNAIDS did to create the Universal Access Plan is an amazing step in the right direction to eradicate HIV/AIDS, no leading country has yet collaborated with UNAIDS to enact the plan. The United States and its global partners should be working with UNAIDS to complete the proposed plan. After creating the Universal Access Plan, UNAIDS presented it to the Group of Eight (G8), a global needs awareness collation, which includes the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Germany, Russia, and Japan. The G8, one of the most powerful global entities, showed great support for the Universal Access Plan; however, to date it has not implemented the plan. Using the tiered scale-up plan, the G8 is more than capable of providing the prevention and education programs, medical therapies, sustainable-community programs, and ambitious attitude needed to start curbing infection rates and reducing the incidence of HIV/AIDS and related concerns. However, the G8 has not lived up to its identity as a global leadership team. The G8's past involvement in HIV/AIDS crises proves that it is the best candidate to enact the Universal Access Plan. When the governments of the G8 countries work with HIV-affected areas, they motivate the local and national governments to make ambitious goals leading to stabilization of the virus (Financial 15). The G8 needs to reengage in the HIV/AIDS crisis immediately, to prevent the pandemic from becoming even bigger. There is a certain urgency needed to effectively combat the HIV/AIDS pandemic. The concept of an ever-increasing pandemic holds a dually evil nature. The longer the G8 waits to implement the Universal Access Plan, the more people will struggle against HIV/AIDS, and the more lives will be lost to the pandemic. Less intuitive, however, is the fact that the longer the G8 waits, the more difficult curbing the virus will become. Because of the explosive nature of HIV/AIDS, increasing infection rates create more people who need care, and more programs needed to assist those who need care. Thus, as the pandemic continues to reign unchecked, more financial support is needed to effectively stand against the disease. By taking a passive stance concerning the Universal Access Plan, the G8 is only exacerbating the HIV/AIDS problem. For example, the Universal Access Plan projects that per year, about 10 billion US dollars are needed for the next ten years to supply every HIV/AIDS infected person with necessary healthcare, and implement effective national education and prevention programs to decrease infection rates (Financial, 15). However, if no group takes initiative within the next five years, the numbers will be even larger. Immediate application of the Universal Access Plan would prevent over half of the new infections that are projected to occur between 2005 and 2015. The 2005 UNAIDS Financial Resources report cites the implications of the G8's passivity the best: The high levels of funding that will be needed to move towards universal access [care for all HIV/AIDS-affected persons] in the coming years reflect the world's failure to respond to the epidemic before it achieved crisis dimensions. Had the world made prudent investments 10-20 years ago  in prevention, in strengthening health systems in low- and middle-income countries, in preserving and building essential human resources, in addressing the corrosive effects of gender inequities and other drivers of the epidemic  much smaller amounts would be required today (Financial 5). Just as the lack of response from global leaders in the past created a crisis today, careless attitudes concerning HIV/AIDS today will render a catastrophe of epic proportions if the G8 and other global leaders do not make some financial contribution now. Some would say that the United States and other national governments should not be responsible for dealing with the financial burden of HIV/AIDS, because that job belongs to the various humanitarian organizations like UNAIDS that already work with the disease. It is true that national governments have many concerns to balance, and the weight of AIDS does not make the burden lighter. The reality is, however, that global governmental groups are by far in the best position to move against HIV/AIDS. Humanitarian organizations are most effective in providing on-the-ground support running medical clinics, supplying food and shelter, and running educational camps to teach people about HIV/AIDS. However, they are not as well suited to build a financial support system of the proportion needed to eradicate HIV/AIDS. Relief organizations are funded by donations from private individuals, in addition to occasional corporate funding. Because funding for these organizations comes from individual people, it would be impossible for any group of relief organizations to raise the 100 billion of projected need. Additionally, it is difficult for relief organizations to obtain permission to be present from both national and local governments in foreign areas affected by HIV/AIDS. Often relief is only provided to countries that invite the relief organizations to participate in the combat of HIV/AIDS. This makes it difficult to implement the necessary health, educational, and sustainability programs needed to relieve stress on struggling communities. In contrast, global governmental groups like the G8 can easily provide the funding needed for HIV/AIDS. The countries that comprise the G8 represent approximately 65 percent of the world economy (Of the eight countries involved, seven of them hold positions as the highest military expenditure countries globally) (G8). If each of the G8 countries pledged an equal share of the needed 100 billion in funds, each country would contribute 12.5 billion US dollars. In a nation where hundreds of billions of dollars are spent on military funding and war every year, it seems that 12.5 billion in funding is a minor expense to pay to curb the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Additionally, world-recognized groups like the G8 are in a better position to provide needs to struggling areas because they have more political power and can work directly with national governments to implement plans that affect local communities. They do not have to struggle with the same bureaucratic red tape many humanitarian organizations deal with. As a globally recognized authority, the G8 has both the financial resources and the political influence to enact such a comprehensive plan. Because the G8 as a united entity needs to step up to the challenge of HIV/AIDS, one might ask why the United States should contribute more money to the HIV/AIDS crisis when President Bush has already generously implemented The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). One could argue that the United States is already concerned about HIV/AIDS and that the other G8 countries need to do more. President Bush's concern and active stance against HIV/AIDS are admirable. Unfortunately, the PEPFAR program falls short of the need for intervention. PEPFAR has guaranteed 20 billion for AIDS funding sometime in the next ten years. However, the funding is geared to treat 2.5 million people living with HIV/AIDS by 2015. While these efforts are commendable, UNAIDS predicts that by 2010 there will already be over 10 million people in need of treatment (Schroering). By simple mathematical analysis, this means that the format of the PEPFAR program would dictate a need for 120 billion (over four times the promised amount of funding) to actually provide universal access to HIV/AIDS prevention measures outlined in the Universal Access Plan. Clearly, it seems that the PEPFAR program misallocates its resources to serve such a small number of people. The PEPFAR program's flaws are that it allocates most of its funds for the physical treatment of HIV/AIDS through antiretroviral therapy (medicinal) provision and some sexual education, in an untimely fashion. While these issues need to be addressed to combat HIV/AIDS infection and death rates, they do not get to the root problems of the HIV/AIDS virus. PEPFAR has no programs focused on disease education and sustainable community development, and it does not follow the projected UNAIDS timeline. Thus, the United States needs to remain actively engaged combating the disease because its current measures against the disease will not work. The United States is the most powerful nation in the world, so it needs to lead a powerful plan to combat HIV/AIDS that includes funding for solutions to the root problems surrounding HIV/AIDS. The type of funding that will curb the HIV/AIDS pandemic has already been outlined by UNAIDS in the Universal Access Plan. Plans like PEPFAR need to provide funding for antiretroviral treatments and sexual education programs, but they must also provide funding for programs that educate about the actual circumstances of the disease. They additionally need to provide funding for sustainable community development. Because the PEPFAR program does not fully address problems like food shortages, education about HIV/AIDS, and other issues the Universal Access Plan does address, the money, time, and effort given to PEPFAR has a small return in terms of its impact on the pandemic. Without funding to combat issues that are root problems of the HIV/AIDS crisis, progress against the disease that leads to an eventual phase-out of funding will not be made. Education programs that teach people about the stigmas and myths associated with HIV-AIDS are much more effective in slowing its transmission as sexual education programs. Sustainable community development programs build communities that become economically self-dependant, creating opportunities to end funding. Without funding for the education and sustainable community development programs that the Universal Access Plan calls for, financial support for HIV-AIDS becomes a life-line to struggling communities. Funding that only provides medicine and sexual education programs is like putting a Band-Aid on a broken arm; the arm will only get more infected because it was not given the proper treatment. PEPFAR is not a solution to the HIV/AIDS crisis; it is only a basis to begin larger-scale efforts like those presented by the UNAIDS Universal Access Program. The two most necessary focuses of HIV-AIDS prevention are sustainable community development and HIV-AIDS education. HIV-AIDS education should be focused on sexual education, but the actual facts about what the disease is and how it affects people are just as important. The stigmas and myths that surround the virus increase its transmission, while deplorable living conditions make maintaining a healthy HIV-positive status difficult (World Vision Aids Experience). Education about the disease will diffuse these myths, while learning domestic skills like growing crops or producing a retail good like jewelry, baskets, or cloth will help people in HIV-affected communities stabilize their economic need, decreasing constant dependence on relief money. Uganda is a model country that has implemented effective educational programs about HIV/AIDS. The programs it implemented serve to teach people the difference between reality and the myths and stigmas that contribute to high infection rates. Many think AIDS is a curse from God, witchcraft, or a means of warfare by industrialized countries like the United States (World Vision Aids Experience). These false beliefs create stigmas that cause a plethora of problems. Frequently, people struck ill with HIV/AIDS do not receive care because family and community members believe casual contact, like being coughed on or touching infected people can transmit HIV. When the parents of young children in Africa die from AIDS, relatives who could care for them often abandon the children; in some cases they are even rejected from the community. This rejection and lack of care yields the child-headed household phenomenon: one child caring for several younger siblings while dually trying to provide basic needs like food, without the opportunity to pursue an education. Likewise, some people believe that having sex with virgins cure HIV or that condoms spread HIV. This myth increases incidents of rape and unprotected sexual activity (World Vision Aids Experience). By implementing a national educational program about HIV/AIDS, Uganda successfully diffused these types of myths, decreasing its infection rate to fewer than three percent of the national population (World Vision Aids Experience). Those who already have the virus are less stigmatized, receiving better care from health clinics and their families or friends. Funding for more national educational programs like those in Uganda would slow down the infection rate and reduce stigmas around HIV/AIDS patients. The G8 should be funding these kinds of education programs. Because these programs target the unhealthy trends that spread HIV-AIDS, educational programs will lead to eradication of HIV-AIDS much faster and with much less funding that only giving people antiretroviral drugs and condoms. Apart from stigmas and myths, the problem of non-self-sustainable communities generates multiple economic issues for countries fighting HIV-AIDS. Inadequate food supplies and clean drinking water cause those who could be healthily living with HIV to struggle. Antiretroviral drugs will not work without proper nutrition. This poses a huge problem in areas where agricultural workers often contract HIV and cannot accomplish their job of producing food (World Vision International). The labor supply for the agricultural community dwindles, and food shortages become abundant. Governments themselves feel economic repercussions from lower agricultural production, inhibiting their ability to provide relief to their own citizens. The few relief programs that attempt to develop sustainable communities teach individuals and communities how to cultivate gardens that can produce the grains, fruits, and vegetables needed to feed the community. Many humanitarian organizations have tried without success to develop the sustainable community programs needed to help HIV-AIDS-ravaged areas become economically independent again. The reality simply is that humanitarian organizations do not have the might to create comprehensive, far-reaching sustainability programs. While they may teach an individual to grow vegetables for daily food, they cannot mandate governmental programs to provide employment or education. Industrialized nations like the United Sates that have previously experienced economic crises have an advantageous position in assisting struggling countries. National governments understand the economic needs of the individual people, but also of the country as a whole. For example, during the Great Depression, President Roosevelt created the New Deal program to serve many issues experienced due to the strained economy. One part of his program generated jobs for individual people through civil service industries like building and repairing infrastructures. The all-encompassing financial reformations, however, provided relief to the nation as a whole. The United States with the G8 can assist third world countries to develop the necessary sustainable community programs to help create governments that deal with HIV-AIDS internally, without need for funding in the future. If the G8 would provide the basis funding to launch comprehensive sustainable community development programs, later funding would be unnecessary. All of the countries represented in the G8 have experienced national crises before and successfully emerged from them. Thus, it is much better for the experienced G8 to help struggling communities, both locally and nationally. Many humanitarian organizations are passionately committed to eradicating HIV-AIDS. Funds raised by the private sector are helpful in providing community-to-community support through education, heath needs, and development of sustainable community programs. Unfortunately, the HIV/AIDS pandemic is already too big for these relief organizations. National governments like those involved in the G8 should increase the funding for HIV/AIDS relief and develop programs that deal with the root-problems exacerbating the effects of the virus. If nationally funded programs were in place to create communities where local citizens were self-sufficient and well-informed about HIV-AIDS, instead of providing short-term relief through medicinal support and sexual education for suffering countries, governmental monies would create environments that no longer depended on foreign aid. The HIV/AIDS pandemic would stabilize and in a few decades eventually recede, ending the need for funding. The G8 and other national governments can only help themselves by fighting HIV/AIDS. With the proper resources and allocation of funding, the G8 could easily stabilize HIV/AIDS by 2015, eliminating a pandemic that will only present more problems in the future if not dealt with immediately. The United States, the most powerful nation in the world, should set an example for the rest of the G8 by implementing the full Universal Access Plan, and as soon as possible. It is our responsibility both as leaders and human beings, and making the right decisions for funding as soon as possible can prevent a future epic disaster.

ENG.G0.03.2,William Faulkner's As I Lay Dying,English,Argumentative Essay,"One common problem for the Christian tradition is the idea of evil in the world. Many struggle to believe in a faithful and loving god when there are so many apparent problems with society. People feel that if God is so loving and just, merciful and great, He would not let there be so much pain and struggle and toil in the world. Toil is a concept thoroughly explored in William Faulkner's As I Lay Dying. In Faulkner's tale, the Bundren family endures physical and emotional pain to a heightened degree, while claiming trust in a god who seems not to care about them at all. Faulkner explores one's personal view of God through the suffering of the family as they try to bury their dead wife and mother. He creates in the character of Anse one who trusts in God, but through Anse's crude musings on theology and scripture, Faulkner actually paints an unjust and unfaithful god. Faulkner introduces the character Anse with in a monologue where Anse is complaining about all of the things going wrong in his life. Anse blames a number of different objects and people for the grievances he suffers, in a seemingly random fashion that impresses on the reader his dismal outlook on life. However, upon a closer look at Anse's problems, a common theme emerges. The major and continuous problem Anse finds in his pathetic life is the road by his house. His first statement is Durn that road, (35), followed by a cursing of the rain, his sons, the men or government in charge of building the road, and even the idea of taxation. While Anse does not solely curse the road, he curses the rain because it appears to travel up the road toward his farm. He curses his sons because they have to travel on the road; he curses the men for building the road; he curses paying taxes because his tax money probably helped pay for the road. Amidst Anse's philosophizing, there are deeper concepts within the language that Faulkner uses to explore the impact of the road on Anse's life. When Anse begins his monologue about the problematic road, he contemplates God's role in the creation of the road. Anse reasons that God (through divine intervention) uses men to build roads on the earth, and that in His divine power, He would never build a road and later build a house beside it. Anse states that instead, Man has somehow aggravated God's initial intention for roads by building houses beside them: precisely where they should not be. Anse concludes this portion of his monologue and begins his next point about the road: &keeping the folks restless and wanting to get up and go somewheres else when He aimed for them to stay put like a tree or a stand of corn. Because if He'd aimed for man to be always a-moving and going somewheres else, wouldn't He a put him longways on his belly, like a snake? It stands to reason He would. Putting it where every bad luck prowling can find it and come straight to my door, charging me taxes on top of it. Making me pay for Cash&(36). The abrupt transition between these two paragraphs makes one ask, But wait, who does the phrase 'putting it' refer to? It may be an implicit reference to the men who built the road; however, because this idea is unclear, the unidentified party responsible for building the road could also be read as God. Whether or not this logic is correct, Anse has already discussed that God plays some role in human actions, by crediting God with the concept of a road: God put roads for traveling (35). This causes an interpretation problem for the reader: Faulkner has allowed his character seemingly to contradict himself by stating that God does not lay roads by houses, but then leaving the language vague enough for one reasonably to assume Anse is still cursing God for building the road near the pre-existing house. Because Anse has already stated that God does not build roads by houses, this generates the idea that God is breaking His own rules. If Anse's character is saying implicitly that God has broken His own rules, then the rest of Anse's monologue develops new meaning. Next, Anse discusses his eldest son Cash. Here it is useful to note that Anse regards his entire family as his possession on a level uncommon in society today. Not only are they his flesh and blood, but their time and ability to produce fruitful labor belongs to him as well. This concept becomes apparent when Jewel purchases the horse and Anse reprimands him. You know how tight it is for us to make money, yet you bought a horse for me to feed. Taken the work from your flesh and blood and bought a horse with it, (136). Thus, Anse survives off the abilities and hard work of his family. It is worthy to note that Faulkner names Anse's most financially prosperous son Cash,  precisely that which he means to Anse. Anse complains further in his monologue by saying of Cash, Making me pay for Cash having to get them carpenter notions when if it hadn't been no road come there, he wouldn't a got them; falling off of churches and& (36). Here Cash, the bringer of financial prosperity, has fallen off a church: a house of God. The very same God who caused the building of the road that brings all of Anse's problems has ironically through the road given Cash a means of financial stability, and then taken it away again through his workmanship on a church. Not only has Cash fallen off the church, but he is also injured, so Anse will not make any money from Cash's work. It would seem that the road God allowed to be built by the house is not helpful to Anse's financial or personal situation. Within his final rant about the road, Anse blames it for Addie being sick. His unclear logical connection between the road and Addie dying only exacerbates the idea that something supernatural or divine must be at work to make a simple road the reason for someone to die. He says of his ill wife: She was well and hale as ere a woman were, except for that road. Just laying down, resting herself in her own bed, asking naught of none. &'You lay down and rest you,' I said. 'I knowed you are not sick. You're just tired. You lay you down and rest.'&And she was laying there, well and hale as ere a woman ever were, except for that road, (37). Here Anse describes his wife as laying down. He has already stated a theological idea that God made the road horizontal for traveling, and that other things made for traveling are horizontal as well, like snakes, wagons, and teams of oxen. He says that God made people to be in one place; this is why they stand vertically. This description of Addie as laying down, repeated four times within the paragraphs, feeds the idea of the road taking Addie away on a journey, away from Anse and the family through the medium of death. Just as the road brings Cash the desire to be a carpenter, it brings for Addie a desire to die and begin a new journey. Again then, the root of Addie's death is not just the simple road, but really the God who allowed the road to be built beside the house, consequently breaking His own rules. As Faulkner develops his character and allows the reader to explore what Anse believes and sees about God, he moves away from Anse's complex theology and into the Christian myth of original sin and the sin-curse. In another titled chapter, Anse begins by saying: It's a hard country on a man; it's hard. Eight miles of the sweat and blood of his body washed up outen the Lord's earth, where the Lord Himself told him to put it, (110). Here Anse is referring to the sin-curse that God places on Adam and Eve, and consequently, all people, after they eat of the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil (from which they have been forbidden to eat). God curses Adam with the following: Cursed is the ground because of you; in toil you will eat of it all the days of your life. Both thorns and thistles it shall grow for you; and you will eat the plants of the field; by the sweat of your face you will eat bread, till you return to ground, (9). Here Faulkner toys with another paradox through Anse's words. God has told Man that he must labor with the earth to survive, yet through the supernatural power of the storm, God has undone all of the work and effort Man put into cultivating the land. As the family travels the eight miles to Jefferson, they are faced with destruction after destruction: bridges washed out and crops flooded and suffering. A mangled land that was carefully manicured by Man is now in complete disarray. God has cursed Man to toil with the land, but even after Man does toil with the land an prospers even a little, God washes away all of his hard work anyway with the storm. Anse continues his soliloquy by discussing why a man would live off the land in such a fruitless fashion. He laments that the town people seem to prosper off his hard work while he never prospers. However, he finds comfort in that there is a reward for those who are hardworking, implying a reward from God of eternal salvation, blessings, and joy. He refutes this point by recalling a piece of scripture from the book of Matthew. Anse says, Every man will be equal there and it will be taken from them that have and given to them that have not by the Lord, (110). The problem with this scriptural recollection is that it is incorrect. The Matthew 13 passage is a quote where Jesus is teaching his disciples through parables. When questioned about why he teaches in parables, Jesus responds, For whoever has, to him more shall be given, and he will have an abundance; but whoever does not have, even what he has shall be taken away from him, (1386). Not only does Anse get the quote wrong, he gets it backward. The incorrect Biblical quote being wrong echoes the sin-curse myth: that despite all the sweat and toil that Man puts into laboring with the land, he will not be rewarded by the land. Likewise, it seems that no matter what kind of labor and effort Anse puts into being an honest, hardworking man, (110), he will not earn a reward. The people in the world who already are prosperous (here, Anse says the townspeople) will prosper more, and those who struggle and fight for a comfortable life will only have that taken away. There seems to be no blessing for the poor man, and justice is turned on its head as the rich prosper without ever having to work hard. Despite Anse's belief that he will receive a heavenly reward someday for his toil, he does have some doubts about the validity of his hope. In the final two paragraphs of his soliloquy, Anse says that it seems bad that he should have to earn his reward by disgracing his family and dead wife through the journey to bury her. These inklings of doubt in his hope for some sort of salvation are finally echoed in his final scriptural recollection. I am the chosen of the Lord, for who He loveth, so He doeth chastiseth, (110). The scripture Anse recalls is a proverb that the writer of Hebrews later recalls in discussing the role of discipline in sanctification. This juxtaposition of the god Anse hopes will give him an eternal reward with a god who takes away from and disciplines those who have little creates a disconnect between Anse's god and the identity of God found in the text. The god Anse speaks of is the merciful, benevolent, saving-grace God of Christianity. However, the god deep in the text is an evil demiurge god who brings anger and wrath on the poor and needy, punishing all with the sin-curse given to Adam and Eve, yet allowing some to escape the curse at the sake of others who really deserve grace more. When all of the puzzle pieces of Anse's theological ideas fit together, they create a unique image of the God he claims to believe in. The identity of God that Faulkner builds through Anse is not the one known to a young child in Sunday school. While Anse says that God is good, God loves him, and that God will take care of him, Faulkner uses Anse's language and philosophy along side of the circumstances of life to build a picture of God quite the opposite. This God Faulkner paints through Anse is one who deceives humans, causes them toil and pain, and has a skewed concept of justice. Faulkner portrays that God has unjustly made everyone pay for the sins of Adam and Eve, and that when people escape their curse by off-loading on others, God responds unjustly by prospering the prosperous and making life harder for the poor. He says that God has not been the faithful god of the people He promised to be; He breaks His own rules all the time, evidenced through the hardship of the poor, and allows people to suffer. Faulkner expects to find from life a god who will be grace and mercy and love, even for people like Anse who seem worthless. However, Faulkner communicates through As I Lay Dying that if that ideal god does exist, he has never met Him.

ENG.G0.04.1,The Absolute Necessity of College Level Writing Courses,English,Argumentative Essay,"Reading Mike Rose's article, The Language of Exclusion: Writing Instruction at the University only reaffirmed my pre-existing belief of the importance of writing and writing well. It also reaffirmed why I continue to have absolutely no doubt that writing courses should be nothing less than compulsory at universities and colleges. Institutions of higher education should not only continue to offer writing courses, but they should endorse and embrace the teaching of them. It is the higher educational institutions' responsibility and obligation to provide students with opportunities to improve their writing expertise just as it is their responsibility and obligation to provide students with a solid and well-rounded education in which writing plays a rather large role  whether it be a research university or not. I believe that writing is a skill and I do not agree that labeling it as such should be considered the kiss of death. 1 It is common knowledge that universities and colleges teach principles and theories, but in most classroom situations, in order for students to convey to their professors and GSIs that they have grasped the principles and theories that they have been taught, they are required to utilize their skill of writing while taking exams and/or writing papers and they are expected to utilize it well. Therefore, college level writing courses should be mandatory. By making them mandatory, students' writing skills would be elevated to the level that is necessary in order for them to do well in the classes that teach them the higher level principles and theories. In my opinion, by not making writing courses mandatory at universities and college, it is the student who receives the kiss of death. In today's college classroom, and in today's world, writing and writing well is a skill that is an absolute necessity. Rose's article also states: to discuss writing as a skill, then, is to place it in the realm of the technical 2 as if the realm of technical is a bad or negative thing. No doubt, writing is technical, and is definitely a technique, but this is only one aspect of writing. Writing is also intellectual, and is, therefore, much more complex. To classify it as being only technical is reductive and incorrect. I found it interesting that in Rose's article the academy, chose to make the statement that skill is nothing but a technique, something acquired differently from the way one acquires knowledgefrom drill, from practice, from procedures that conjure up the hand and the eye activities 3 and then attempts to use a partial definition of the term from the American Heritage Dictionary (AHD) in order to justify and support their claim. But, there is a problem with their definitionit is incomplete. In the article, skill is defined as An art, trade, or technique, particularly one requiring use of the hands or body. 4 In other words, the academy took only what they needed from the AHD definition of skill to serve their purpose, which was to claim that writing is nothing but a technique that requires only the hands and body. Again, it is important to note that this is not the complete or whole definition, and, therefore, is inaccurate. Besides the former and partial definition, the complete and correct entry for the term skill in the AHD is as follows: Proficiency, facility, or dexterity that is acquired or developed through training or experience, further, A developed talent or ability, such as writing skills. 5 What this complete definition of skill then means is that in order for one to gain an advanced degree of competence, and adeptness at writing, which includes mental as well as physical ability, one has to continuously practice it and develop it. This is just another reason why colleges and universities should offer their students writing courses. Regardless of the academy's attempt to relegate writing to the second-class and relegate it to the realm of the technical, writing is, and will remain, a key component to higher education whether the academy tries to classify it as technical or not. I also believe that writing development is a continuum. But according to Rose's article there are many in the academy who do not agree. This fact is exhibited in the following statement: In the case of writing, the skills should be mastered before one enters college and takes on high-order endeavors&.Yes, the skill can be refined, but its fundamental development is over, completed via a series of elementary and secondary school courses and perhaps one or two college courses, often designated remedial. 6 It is obvious from this statement what the academy is saying. And I disagree with several aspects of this claim. First, I personally experienced very little writing instruction during my secondary education and I have witnessed the same with my two sons' secondary education as well, with the latter causing me great concern. It really wasn't until college that I was exposed to more rigorous writing requirements and found that in order to fulfill those requirements, further writing instruction and practice was needed. Second, I don't feel that because someone doesn't receive adequate instruction in writing during secondary school that they are illiterate and that the answer is remedial 7 English courses. How about dropping the word remedial and just calling them English or writing courses? I have personally taken writing courses while at the University of Michigandoes this fact make me one of those who are [among] the truly illiterate? 8 I then must ask: if I am (or was) illiterate (because of my need and desire for further writing instruction) why did the University of Michigan offer me admission? The answer is simple: I am not illiterate, nor was I illiterate when I entered the University. All I needed was further, and better, writing instruction at the college level in order to successfully complete the college level courses and their requirements. In short, the two go hand in hand. I submit to the academy's complaint that perhaps secondary schools are not fulfilling their part when it comes to writing. But this is and has been an ongoing problem and will not be easily solved  if it every really is. In any case, I firmly believe that the universities and colleges across this country have to face reality, address this issue head-on, and quit placing the blame and burden entirely on secondary schools. They also need to stop reducing writing to a second-class intellectual status or faculty, students, and society [will continue] to view the teaching of writing 9 as not their responsibility and the problem will never be truly solved. I agree with Mike Rose when he states that it is a bitter pill to swallow when referring to writing as being reduce[d] to a second-class intellectual status 10 but I do not agree that we have little choice [but] to swallow it. 11 We do have a choice and by making every institution of learning, at every level, responsible for teaching and supporting the teaching of writing, the so-called language of exclusion will eventually become a dead language when it comes to the skill of writing.

ENG.G0.05.1,People or Property?,English,Argumentative Essay,"In several of Shakespeare's plays, father  daughter relationships are defined primarily in terms of an ultimatum or a single function. In A Midsummer's Night Dream, Egeus attempts to force his daughter, Hermia, to marry Demetrius, as Egeus has promised Demetrius. When she refuses, he offers the option of the convent or death, effectually a non-choice. In Hamlet, Claudius continually tries to control Ophelia's interactions with Hamlet, either by forbidding her from seeing him or using her as bait in order to spy on the prince, and she is also given unappealing options that do not include being with the man she loves. In both plays, daughters are subject to the wills of their fathers and are treated more so as objects than as rational human beings. A Midsummer's Night Dream opens with Egeus bringing a case against his daughter before the king. Egeus has given his consent to Demetrius to marry his daughter, but she refuses to consent due to the wooing of her by Lysander. Egeus confronts Lysander with: With cunning hast thou flich'd my daughter's heart; Turn'd her obedience, which is due to me, To stubborn harshness (1.1.36-38) When Egeus refers to Hermia as my daughter, he is not only establishing their familial relationship with the word my; he is also indicating ownership. Hermia is his daughter not just because she was born to his wife, but also because he is in control of her. Her obedience belongs to him and him alone, and Egeus is enraged at the new stubbornness that Lysander's advances have planted in Hermia. Egeus, as Hermia's father, has promised her to another man, and Egeus refuses to allow his daughter to interfere in the dealing between two men: And she is mine, and all my right of her/ I do estate unto Demetrius (1.1.97-98). Although it may be Hermia's hand that is being given in marriage, it is only Egeus that holds to right to promise this hand, and he requests that the law be applied on his behalf: I beg the ancient privilege of Athens, As she is mine, I may dispose of her; Which shall be either to this gentleman, Or to her death, according to our law (1.1.41-44) The very laws of Athens support Egeus in his view of his daughter as his possession, as an object subject to his disposal, and though these laws are framed as an ultimatum, there truly is no choice to be made. Egeus' only presents two choices to his daughter: marriage to the man of his choosing or death. Death is not a reasonable option, though, leaving Hermia with no choice but to obey her father. After she pleads for pardoning of her boldness, Theseus does offer Hermia another choice, however, but not after reiterating that to her, her father should be as a god and that she should obey his will (1.1.46). Theseus tells Hermia that she is but a form in wax who has been imprinted by her father (1.1.48-49). Her image and her will are and should be aligned with and merely reflections of her father's. Hermia is not legally or culturally allowed to make her own decisions, but her eyes must with [her fathers] judgment look (1.1.57). The options that Theseus presents are not much more appealing. Though he does offer her the option to refuse to marry Demetrius, this refusal would result in her death or her taking the vows of a nun. Again, Hermia is given options that are merely variations on the same theme. Either choice that she could make would exile her from the man that she loves and the life that she is accustomed to leading. Although Demetrius and Lysander are very similar men with very similar social standing, a fact that is admitted to by the king, one cannot be traded for the other. Because Egeus has promised his daughter to Demetrius, there is no turning back from this decision. Hermia cannot chose who she can marry, nor can she chose to refuse the man who has been chosen for her without facing serious consequence because she is not seen as an individual person capable of making her own decisions but as a commodity that can be bartered between two men. Demetrius requests that Lysander give up his pursuit of Hermia, with: Lysander, yield/Thy crazed title to my certain right, and Egeus speaks of estating his right to Hermia to Demetrius (1.1.91-92 and 97-98). Hermia is discussed in terms of property, as an object that has a title, or deed, that can be given from one owner to the next. By deciding her fate for her and refusing to give her say in her own future, the men in Hermia's life abolish her personhood, treating her instead like an object. In Hamlet, Ophelia is given a bit more freedom in her actions, but she is still expected to obey her father's wishes. Though she is at first allowed to see Hamlet, when her brother and father notice that she is spending too much time with the prince, they confront her about it. As he is about to leave for France, Laertes reminds his sister that she is not of the same social status as Hamlet, and that, because of this, he may never be able to commit to marry her due to his required commitment to his country. This warning is not intended to protect Ophelia from a broken heart, however; it is to protect her from a scandalous reputation. Immediately after this goodbye scene, Polonius echoes the concerns that have been raised by his son: Tis told me he hath very oft of late Given private time to you, and you yourselfHave of your audience been most free and bounteous.If it be so, as so tis put to me,And that in caution, I must tell youYou do not understand yourself so clearlyAs it behooves my daughter, and your honor (1.3.91-97) Polonius chastises his daughter for being too generous with her time in regards to Hamlet. Although he does not believe that Ophelia is actually in danger of compromising her purity, speculation and rumors are just as detrimental, and the behavior of his daughter is a direct reflection on his own social standing. Polonius reminds Ophelia that she is not acting as the daughter of Polonius ought to behave, and that she is not acting in a manner that reflects her honor. The order in which Polonius puts these two is reflective of the order of importance these aspects are to him. And your honor is placed at the end of his sentence, almost as if it were merely an aside, merely added at the last minute. While it may be important that Ophelia's honor remains intact and unsullied, to Polonius, this is only important so long as it is a reflection upon his own status and honor. It is not so important that Ophelia stays chaste and true to herself as it is that she stays true to the expectations that are required of a daughter of Polonius. Ophelia, like Hermia, is only viewed as an extension of her father, and Polonius uses this status of Ophelia as a near-object to glean information about the mental state of the prince. After Ophelia obeys her father's wishes and refuses any more letters from Hamlet, Hamlet enters her room in a fit of enraged madness, and Ophelia obediently tells her father of this incident. Polonius confronts the royal family with a letter from Hamlet to Ophelia; a letter that she has given her father in her duty in obedience that comes from Ophelia belonging to Polonius as his daughter (2.2.107). The parents come to the conclusion that Hamlet's insanity is based in his love for Ophelia, and they plan to spy on a conversation between the lovers to confirm their suspicions. In the odd scene that follows, Ophelia is confronted by Hamlet in a state of madness, either genuine or feigned, and Hamlet offers Ophelia an ultimatum reminiscent of the one given to Hermia in A Midsummer Night's Dream. As Hamlet is attempting to drive Ophelia away by professing that he no longer nor has never loved her, he commands her to go to a nunnery (3.1.119). If this is taken as a literal statement and not as an innuendo for a brothel and, therefore, an insult to Ophelia's purity, Hamlet essentially tells Ophelia that since they can no longer see each other or wed, she is left only with the option to enter a nunnery and commit to a life of purity. When this option is not seen as adequate, or insulting, enough, Hamlet offers one more: to marry a fool (3.1.134). Like Hermia, Ophelia is left with no viable options; she cannot have the man that she loves, and she does not want to marry the alternative option or forsake the company of men forever. Interestingly, though each daughter is offered a concrete set of options, at the conclusion of each play, each woman ends up making a choice that was not offered to her, but was offered to the woman in the other play. Hermia, after a night of magical madness in the forest, is allowed to marry Lysander, now that Demetrius has realized his bewitched love for Helena. Ophelia, after being driven mad by grief from the loss of her father and her lover, chooses death and drowns herself in the river. In the comedy of A Midsummer Night's Dream, the unexpected choice must be a positive one; the young lovers must end up coupled in exactly the right way. In the tragedy of Hamlet, Ophelia must meet a tragic end by choosing this tragic ending for herself. Even though both women are similarly objectified and controlled by their fathers and the other men in their lives, the genres in which they exist provide alternate ways out for each of them. Hermia and Ophelia are both subjected to the wills of their fathers, brothers, kings, and lovers. They are presented with set choices that are not truly distinct options but merely variations on the same theme, and both must obey the wishes of the men in their lives. Both daughters are dehumanized and commodified, leading them to be viewed as merely extensions of their fathers and being used only to maintain or further the families' honor. When marriage to another's choice of man, death, or life in a nunnery are offered unappealingly, Hermia and Ophelia must create new and different options for themselves, bringing about rather different endings for both of the women.

ENG.G0.06.2,A (Solitary) Place For Fantasy in Reality,English,Argumentative Essay,"Reality is composed of a rather tenuous fabric in the catalogue of fantasy novels we have explored this semester. The majority of this catalogue introduces a protagonist whose life is grounded somewhat firmly in the real world, but who also happens to encounter the fantastic. Unlike fantastic novels in which the protagonist is placed in a world that is wholly fantastic (that is, a world in which all characters acknowledge and accept the fantastic as being normal), fantastic novels set in reality require that measures be in place to preserve the laws of reality for the characters living outside of the protagonist's experiences. Were reality-based characters introduced to the concepts of the fantastic without the first-hand experience of the protagonist, the combination of ignorance and unfamiliarity would ultimately result in chaos. Thus, protagonists whose lives are set in reality must journey into or explore the fantastic alone (or in the company of fantastic creatures). Furthermore, to truly ensure the preservation of reality, once such protagonists return to reality, his or her experiences must easily lend themselves to realistic explanations. In Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, for instance, the story is introduced with dreamy, rhyming verses that echo that of a child's lullaby or nighttime prayer in both form and content. The three tongues announce that, In fancy they pursue / The dream-child moving through a land / Of wonders wild and new, / In friendly chat with bird or beast / And half believe it true (no page). This verse encourages the reader to view Alice's journey to Wonderland as a curious dream before she even chases after the white rabbit (117). Thus, though the reader is never told that Alice has fallen asleep and begun dreaming, he or she is conditioned to fit her trip to Wonderland into a realistic framework. Dreams are, of course, a solitary activity as well, and so there is no way for Alice's sister to confirm or deny the actuality of Alice's experience with the fantastic. As a result, her sister does not have to confront or make sense of the fantastic; she is simply left to close her eyes and half [believe] herself in Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all would change to dull reality (117). Similarly, in Marge Piercy's Woman On the Edge of Time, the reader is also set up to view the protagonist's journey into the fantastic through a realistic lens  that lens being Connie's diagnosis of schizophrenia. The hallucinations that result from schizophrenia are, like dreaming, entirely solitary experiences. Therefore, it is a convenient fact that there is Nobody around when Luciente appears to Connie (32). Her diagnosis, drug use, and solitary experiences with Luciente encourage the reader and the present-day characters around her to attribute her journey into the fantastic as solely a manifestation of her mental illness and habits  nothing more. In fact, if it were not for Connie's mental illness, Piercy's work would be an entirely different novel. The realistic explanation for Connie's experiences deters the introduction of superfluous complications in her already conflict-ridden world. Tita's experience with the fantastic in Laura Esquivel's Like Water For Chocolate is slightly different than that of Alice and Connie, but the overall circumstances are deeply similar. Tita's journey into the fantastic does not involve a trip to another land  instead, it is based on her emotions. Because she is forbidden to fully express her emotions until after Mama Elena and Rosaura's deaths, her journey into the fantastic is solitary. For instance, Tita experiences temporary blindness after seeing her sister's white wedding sheet; a sheet that causes her to think of a white church which she had never entered, without dreaming of the day she would enter it on the arm of a man (34). In the privacy afforded by the kitchen and Nacha's twin soul, Tita sheds a few tears for herself into the meringue icing. However, once she leaves this privacy for Pedro and Rosaura's wedding, she [makes] sure her face [does] not reveal the slightest emotion (36). Nacha's death keeps Tita's tears a secret, and the fantastic events that result from her emotions are explained by what her mother sees as a realistic, malicious act  adding an emetic to the wedding cake for revenge. Nacha and Pedro are, at times, privy to Tita's experiences with the fantastic because they drift in and out of being on the same emotional wavelength as she. Her experiences remain private, however, because Nacha has no desire to harm Tita (even in her death), and because Pedro is not allowed to openly express his feelings either. Like Milo from The Phantom Tollbooth, who flops into his chair after school, looking for something interesting to do, protagonists based in realistic settings encounter the fantastic by themselves. In such cases, protagonists' fantastic experiences tend to be manifestations of their own desires for change in their lives. Alice seeks relief from her sleepy boredom; Connie seeks relief from her loneliness and isolation; and Tita seeks relief from her forbidden feelings about Pedro and her mother's control. All three protagonists find this relief, but the convenient, realistic explanations afforded by their solitary experiences allow them to return to an unshaken reality. Whether reality is a desirable place to return to seems to vary, but the fantastic can, at the very least, offer temporary respite.

ENG.G0.06.3,Human-Animal Nature in H.G. Wells and Edgar Allen Poe        ,English,Argumentative Essay,"H.G. Wells' The Island of Dr. Moreau and Edgar Allen Poe's The Black Cat are both tales that explore human and animal nature. Both Dr. Moreau and Poe's narrator deviate from societal norms in their perspectives on human nature. As a result, both men live instinctually and compulsively. Unlike the liberty they allow themselves, however, Dr. Moreau and Poe's narrator view animal nature as if it were composed of malleable, brutish compulsions unworthy of man. The innocent animals involved in each story suffer needlessly at the hands of the two men. Both Moreau and Poe's narrator are aware of the pain they inflict upon the animals, but their personal interests and underestimation of animal nature motivate them to reject blame in every instance of abuse. Instead, the men identify external forces that motivate their behavior, placing blame on these forces rather than themselves. The difference between Moreau and Poe's narrator, however, lies in the feelings each man has about the pain he inflicts. For instance, though Poe's narrator does not accept blame for tormenting Pluto, he does feel remorse for his actions. Moreau, however, views pain as an unnecessary response to necessary scientific research. This perspective does not produce any sort of remorse, since the study of Nature makes a man at last as remorseless as Nature (Wells 115). Ultimately, though, whether he experiences remorse or not, each man's cruelty and misjudgment becomes his downfall. In Poe's tale, the narrator reflects much on his perception of human nature. He describes, for instance, the humanity of feeling that he once possessed, a trait inherently linked to humane treatment of other living creatures (Poe 197). He does not, however, identify this trait as human nature. Instead, he describes it as being unusual and fleeting  a peculiarity of character (192). On the other hand, Poe's narrator declares perverseness  the feeling that motivates him to hang Pluto  to be [a] the primitive [impulse] of the human heart&which give[s] direction to the character of Man (194). This perception of human nature leads Poe's narrator to act according to his perverse impulses, rather than his ever-diminishing humanity of feeling. Conveniently, Poe's narrator avoids blame by placing himself at the mercy of human nature. Moreau also shirks the responsibility of his actions, but rather than condense humanity into a series of irreversible traits, Moreau views humanity as a continuum; it extends from the most underdeveloped animal on one end, to the most advanced, God-like human on the other. This continuum is based on one's drive in life. Moreau is driven to seek the laws of this world's Maker&in [his] way to find out the extreme limit of plasticity in a living shape (Wells 114-115). Moreau's theory allows him to view himself not only as God-like, but also to justify his actions. Concurrently, this continuum also allows Moreau to view pain-driven creatures (whether they be animals or humans) as inferior beings with plentiful opportunity for improvement. As Moreau tells Prendick, But you see I am differently constituted. We are on different platforms. You are a materialist&so long as your own pain drives you&you are an animal (Wells 113). It is here that Moreau and Poe's narrator face potential danger. Moreau's view of animals underestimates the strength of their natural instincts, causing him to believe (incorrectly) that he can conquer their stubborn beast flesh (Wells 118). He believes this despite his awareness of something [he] cannot touch&instincts&that harm humanity, a strange hidden reservoir to burst suddenly and inundate the creature with anger, hate, or fear (Wells 120). But Moreau ignores the implications of this realization  he is blinded by his self-inflated perspective on human/animal nature: his remorseless ego. Similarly, in Poe's narrator's skewed perception of self-control, he incorrectly judges Pluto as a lesser being  an inconsequential outlet for his angry impulses. In fact, although Poe's narrator regrets killing Pluto, he does not expect any immediate repercussions for his actions  only those allotted to him in the afterlife (Poe 194). His disregard for the potential ramifications of his actions foreshadows his demise. Moreau fails in conquering the strange hidden reservoir of animal instinct in the Beast Men, and his callous cruelty drives the pain-driven puma to lash out against his so-called research. As for Poe's narrator, his cold-blooded murder of Pluto seems to result in Pluto's reincarnation as a demonic brute beast. This physical product of the narrator's human nature seeks Pluto's revenge by bringing about immediate, real-world consequences for the narrator's lack of humanity. While it is apparent in each individual story that cruelty to animals yields negative consequences, the pairing of the two works emphasizes this idea to an extreme level. Though it is important to examine the similarities Moreau and Poe's narrator share in their reasoning and actions, it is the difference between their settings that highlights animal cruelty as the undeniable basis for each man's downfall. For a greater contrast could not exist between Moreau's secluded, island laboratory and Poe's narrator's private, metropolitan residence. By recognizing the lack of influence this difference had on either story's outcome, it becomes apparent that no other factor  not setting, motivation, remorsefulness, nor personal justification  matters when animal cruelty exists as well. And so, in the face of better judgment (i.e., humanity of feeling), the men determine their own fates.

ENG.G0.07.1,Effects of digital age on children's literature,English,Argumentative Essay,"Pixels and Print: Effects of the Digital Age on Children's Literature The impact of the Internet and technology on children today is unavoidable: children are increasingly immersed in the digital world through a variety of media. One of my cousins, a happy eighteen-year-old living with Down syndrome, carries her Leap Frog Leap Pad everywhere she goes. When she first received the Leap Pad, she had been reading well below her grade level and hated how difficult it was for her to get through a book. The Leap Pad provided my cousin with an opportunity to see interactions with print as fun, exciting, and relevant: just as she loved watching her DVDs and playing computer games, she grew to enjoy her interactive storybooks. My cousin is only one of millions of children affected by the growth of the digital age in children's literature. The development of the digital environment, including interactive books, graphics, websites, games, movies, and television, has dramatically expanded the realm of children's literature and has influenced the way that children interact with reading and language. Studies of the technology movement in children's literature began at the birth of the Internet and continue as technology becomes more and more applicable to different formats in children's literature. At the turn of the twenty-first century, Theory Into Practice magazine published a series of articles entitled Expanding the Worlds of Children's Literature. In one article, children's literature critic and technology analyst Eliza Dresang wrote about a way of thinking she titled Radical Change, a theoretical construct [that] identifies and explains books with characteristics reflecting the types of interactivity, connectivity, and access that permeate our emerging digital society (Dresang, 1999, 160). While children are still interpreting information through language, they are approaching these new texts with an expectation of connections and meaning that is much different from linear, traditional texts. Dresang explores such texts as David Macaulay's Black and White and The Stinky Cheese Man by Jon Scieszka, books that exemplify the interconnectivity of perspectives, plots, and meaning. Black and White is a four-paneled picture book that uses pictures and text to tell four stories with unlimited connections. The Stinky Cheese Man is a collection of scrutinizing challenges to classic fairy tales that requires the reader have an understanding of the original tales, of story structure, and of comedy. According to Dresang, the way in which children interact with text and meaning has also shifted with the literature they read: They are interactively and freely organizing information and making their own connections, not from left to right, not from beginning to end, not in the traditional straight line, but in any order they choose (Dresang, 1999, 162). Children have begun to own their reading, looking actively for meaning in places and frameworks that did not exist before the digital age. The format of the classic children's picture book has also been challenged as a result of technology. The children's sections of modern bookstores are filled with more than bright colors and graphics; stores sell interactive books, books with characters from TV shows, portable audio books, books that come with stuffed animals, and books that talk back to the reader. In 1999, historian Gloria Skurzynski described the birth of a new kind of book, the portable electronic book that has screens rather than pages (Skurzynski, 1999, 179). She writes, They are easier to read than a laptop screen&and they advance one page at a time with a button push rather than by scrolling (1999). Certainly a technological leap at the time, these portable books paved the way for other book formats to emerge. Eight years later, children are clamoring for their Leapsters and Leap Pads, their books with interactive CD-roms attached, and books downloadable to their PSP or Nintendo DS. One educator compiled a list of technology tools that includes websites like BooksJust4Me and StoryPlace: The Children's Digital Library, which make it easy for children and parents to enjoy a children's story without physically turning the pages (Edyburn, 2007). The BookBox website, which guarantees Education and Fun, allows parents to download e-Books in a variety of languages at reasonable prices (Edyburn, 2007). Even Scholastic Inc. and other publishing companies have sections of their websites dedicated to interactive games with students' favorite storybook characters (Edyburn, 2007). One format in particular has librarians and bookstores rushing to fill the shelves: the graphic novel. Bickers, asserting that publishing companies are taking what the students want to heart, writes, Graphix [a division of Scholastic Inc.] is arguably the first imprint dedicated exclusively to graphic novels for kids, but it is certainly no longer the only one (Bickers, 2007, 63). Publishers realize that putting words and pictures in a format that draws the reader through a story as if he was watching TV or a movie is an effective way to encourage students to read; graphic novels are now being used to retell classic literature like Beowulf or Oliver Twist as well as popular series like Babysitter's Club and the Hardy Boys (Bickers, 2007, 62-63). The Magic School Bus series by Joanna Cole, a favorite among both teachers and students, fills pages of scientific learning with speech bubbles, post-its, and compelling illustrations. While not technically a comic-style graphic novel, there is very little white space in a Magic School Bus book, and that's the way kids like it (Bickers, 2007, 63). In addition, the Bone comic book series by Jeff Smith, published into graphic novels for kids, is one of the most popular items in bookstores, libraries, and book fairs across the country (Bickers, 2007, 63). There is no denying that digital interpretations of children's literature are being encouraged in a variety of places and media, but the effects of this digital hurricane are under the gun in research around the world. One research project proposed that preschoolers would benefit from digital read-alouds as opposed to the traditional print read-aloud. Not surprisingly, the project produced favorable results. Researcher L. Collen summarizes her interpretation of one of the project's results: That children in the traditional storytimes asked no picture-based questions and children in both digital storytimes did ask picture-based questions suggests that&the digital storytimes may have resulted in an enhanced understanding of the story, based on an enhanced visual experience (Collen, 2006, 14). In imagining a class of preschoolers in front of a large screen, one does not need to ponder long on how enthralled the students would be with the enlarged graphics. After all, many preschool-aged children have already been exposed to television and other media. The question remains whether the students were asking questions because they noticed more, or whether the traditional read-aloud format did not adequately encourage these kinds of questions. Continued research and reflection will be necessary if teachers, parents, and society at large wish to determine whether the immersion in digital media that is occurring in schools and homes across the countryand the worldis benefiting our youth. Undoubtedly, the world is becoming more inter-connected with the evolution of the Internet and an exponential increase in communication. Children are clamoring for texts that are graphically appealing and have an element of technology, whether it is a website they can visit, a game they can buy, or an attached CD-rom. Books themselves are changing both in format and in content to meet the increasing demand for interconnectivity, and children are changing as they interact with text in multi-directional, multi-media ways.

ENG.G0.09.2,"Historical Places, Violent Spaces: ",English,Argumentative Essay,"Virginia Woolf's last novel Between the Acts is, more than anything else, a comment on contemporary society and how individuals function within that structure. She uses the house of the Olivers and the small-town pageant to provide a microcosm of the pressures and issues that existed in pre-World War II England. Both the characters and the house, the main focuses of the novel, have their own history of class and culture and attempt to distinguish themselves among the influences and voices of the past. Each character has a way of negotiating the pressures of the past; what the narration becomes is a portrait of people's acceptance of and resistance to their own individual chains of destinyspecifically regarding cycles of violence in history. In Between the Acts, the concept of space acts as a vehicle through which a study of character formation and the difference between individual assertions of place and the ways that history, culture, and one's own past limit freedoms of self-assertion. The concept of space is introduced through the form of the house at which the reader finds the main characters preparing for the annual pageant. The house is described to belong to the Olivers who have only owned the house for a mere a hundred and twenty years. 1 The space is represented as having a history that predates the occupation by the current family, a fact which becomes important as the reader is further exposed to the idiosyncrasies of the Oliver house. Attempting to create a meaningful history for the family and the house, the narrator leads the reader up the principle staircase&[to] a portrait&and ancestress of sorts (Woolf 7). This image of a grand staircase leading up to a commanding matriarch immortalized in a portrait implies a rich and important past. Most importantly, the reader is told that the butler had been a soldier&and, under a glass case there was a watch that had stopped a bullet on the field of Waterloo (Woolf 7). The Oliver lineage is proven to be not only worthy of the house that predates their occupancy, but also worthy of the honor and respect that accompanies those who can be proven to be contributors to England's noble military history. And as the description of space can impart notions of the importance of history and participation, it can also convey ideas about the issues of contemporary politics and the uncertainty of the importance of the individual. As the reader crosses the threshold of the library along with the narrator, it is relayed that a foolish, flattering lady once declared that Books are the mirrors of the soul (Woolf 16). But Isa enters the library, glances over the many books inhabiting the shelves, and realizes There they were, reflecting. What? What remedy was there for her at her agethe age of the century, thirty-ninein books? Book-shy she was, like the rest of her generation; and gun-shy too (Woolf 19). There is a discordance between the space of the library and the woman who enters; Isa, in her modern, newspaper-dominated reality, does not truly belong in an environment dominated by Keats and Shelley. Isa, along with her generation, is unable to harmoniously reconcile the traditions of the past with pull of the present. The evolution of English culture that led to the importance of the newspaper also led to a hesitance to participate in world politics, referenced by the generation being gun-shy and supported by the contemporary resistance to entering the war by Britain. Just as space can imply the idiosyncrasies of a generation, it can also suggest impressions of individual issues and emotions. And as the library evokes feelings of a culture, so the dining room elicits the feeling of individual austerity: The room was empty. Empty, Empty, Empty; silent, silent, silent. The room was a shell, singing of what was before time was; a vase stood in the heart of the house, alabaster, smooth, cold, holding the still, distilled essence of emptiness, silence (Woolf 36-7) Woolf embodies the room's emptiness in the language that she chooses to describe the vacant space. Her reiteration of the words empty and silent creates the illusion of an echo; the reader can almost hear the words bouncing around the shell of the room. The repetition of the s sound also instills the feeling of silence and emptiness in the readeras if the echo continued but petered out until only the s of silent remained. Woolf's description of the dining room as a place this sterile, and cold communicates the emptiness at once felt by most of the occupants of the house. Because the dining room should, according to convention, be a room that is warm and filled with people and food, the lack is especially striking. The reader truly feels the isolation of each individual within the house, and more abstractly within history, suggested by the empty, cold room. And just as Woolf looks to the spaces to evoke certain emotions, she also looks at space as a means to convey social and political issues, mainly the struggle for an individual assert herself amid the din of societal expectations and gender norms. As the dining room is readied for lunch, the reader's attention focuses on the two paintings that hang together in the room: The lady was a picture the man was an ancestor. He had a name&He was a talk producer, that ancestor. But the lady was a picture (Woolf 36). The man in the painting has a story, a name, and even his animals have names (Colin and Buster); the woman, however, remains a woman devoid of both a personal and legendary history. As if to truly emphasize this dichotomy between history and lack thereof, Woolf furthers, He was a talk producer, that ancestor. But the lady was a picture (Woolf 36). The ancestor provides the viewer with a subject, some sort of content that constitutes a story. The woman in the painting remains silent, without a story, without a name. It is also important to note that while the ancestor, in the narrative imaginings of his life, is dismayed that there is only space enough for one of his animals, the woman has plenty of space in her picture, her frame consisting of her person and a silver arrow prop. This contrast of space represents the different circumstances in which men and women have created, or were prohibited from creating, history. Although the lady has plenty of physical space to create a narrative in her painting, she does nother voice is absent from her own story. At the same time, the ancestor almost forces his history on the viewer, shouting loudly of the unimportant animal compatriots. These two paintings and the spaces that they portray is indicative of woman's struggle throughout history to have her voice heard. When Between the Acts was still Pointz Hall, Woolf included a few poems that speak to, among other concepts, the emotional realities of a few of the characters. Poem two, specifically, speaks to an inability to completely remove oneself from one's history, both personal and public. Woolf uses the metaphor of the single burdened donkey in the midst of a caravan, unable to speak with a single strong and authentic voice. None speaks with a voice free from the vibrations of the old voices in the dark caverns. 2 In using the idea of a single member lost not only in a group of compatriots, but also in the plane of history, Woolf explicates exactly how each person is, in space, a mere reflection of the past, guided also by the pressures and conventions of those who accompany an individual in society. People are forever haunted, and influenced, by the voices that remain from speakers past. In acting not by their own volition, but instead by their inability to break with conventional gender compulsions, or rather, what society dictates each personmale or femaleshould do, many of the characters assume the role of the burdened donkey, unable to significantly move fast or far enough from what came before. This inability to break with convention is most poignantly reflected in Giles and Isa's strain, but ultimate failure, to ignore the norms of their gender. In a very emotionally charged scene of impulsive violence, Giles instinctively stamps on a snake in the midst of swallowing a toad, killing them both. Creating the scene for the reader, Woolf presents Giles kicking a stone, a barbaric stone; a pre-historic (Woolf 99). She asserts that stone-kicking was a child's game, a contention that gives Giles an impulsive, childish air (Woolf 99). By aligning Giles with child-like, barbaric, or pre-historic tendencies, Woolf is placing an emphasis on innate or natural inclinations; she wants to convey Giles as a man who acts according to impulse, much like children, who have yet to be influenced by societal pressures. As he observes the two animals, Giles sees the snake in the process of swallowing the toad and so, raising his foot, he stamped on them (Woolf 99). By using the word so, Woolf projects an almost logical causality to the sequence of Giles' actions; the so implies a necessary consequence of the observation. The implication of logic in the destruction of the two animals is indicative of Giles' inability to break with his masculine, and sometimes violent, persona. And although he struggles throughout the novel with his safe, banker image in a climate of combative soldiers, in this scene, Giles reclaims his maleness by demonstrating his facility with strategy and action: a necessary component of the ideal soldier. As Giles is stuck in the prescribed expectations of masculinity, so Isa remains bound in the strictures of womanhood. While Giles proves his manhood in a scene of violence, Isa fulfills her role as a woman by remaining loyal to her husband and children, although her desire to do so is not exactly clear. The reader is introduced to Isa's character in the initial scene of the novel, as a woman concerned with the actions of a man who is not her husband. As she stares at this other man, she thinks on how her webbed feet were entangled by her husband, the stockbroker (Woolf 5). Isa clearly feels as though she is trapped in her marriage to Giles, and yet unable to really disentangle herself and leave. She feels constrained by her position, and throughout the novel, she is constantly trying to convince herself that staying with Giles is good and necessary. Isa creates a mantra that she repeats throughout that becomes a sort of justification of her decision to remain stagnant in her role as Giles' wife: namely that Giles is the father of my children (Woolf 14). At this point, for Isa and Giles, it is clear that love is not really a contributor to their marriage; rather, Isa and Giles maintain a distanced respect that Isa justifies with her constant repetition of Giles' role in the family. She stays with Giles because he fathered her children, children for whom her love is even questionable; she stays because she must. Isa's inability to challenge the male-dominated system is also manifested in her reflections on Giles' infidelity. As Isa sits in the audience, she watches her husband& [and] she could feel Manresa in his wake (Woolf 110). Ultimately, Isa muses that it made no difference; his infidelitybut hers did (Woolf 110). Though Woolf ultimately does not believe there should be a discernable difference between the standards for men and women, she resigns herself that there is a palpable gulf between accepted behavior for each of the gendersespecially concerning familial obligations. Isa permits her husband's infidelity because he represents the provider in the relationship; additionally, without Giles, Isa would not even be present at the Oliver home or pageant. In this perpetuation of expected gender interaction, Woolf's idea of the burdened individual resonates resolutely. Isa is burdened by society's conception of a good mother and wife, and her well-being and happiness necessarily suffers. Clearly, she has at least thought of breaking free of her familial fetters, but inevitably always convinces herself otherwise. By allowing Giles' indiscretions, and refusing to challenge or even object, Isa is complicit in the perpetuation of a conventionally gendered societyshe becomes complicit in her own oppression. Isa's complacency is even more palpably felt in her response to Giles' bloodied tennis shoes. Unlike Mrs. Manresa, Isa does not valorize Giles' act that leaves his shoes bloodied, but she also does not have a particularly adverse reaction to the sight either. Rather Isa dismisses the act of violence with the thought, Silly little boy, with blood on his boots (Woolf 111). In failing to question Giles' actions, or even the motivation for his actions, Isa contributes, perhaps unknowingly, to the continuation of the cycle of violence. By absenting herself completely, Isa participates in and confirms the worth of a male-dominated system of aggression and violence. As MacKay asserts in her examination of Modernism and war: In the novel's sheltered world of village pageants, bazaars and cricket matches, Giles' bloodstained tennis shoes are a powerful emblem of the fall from innocence that comes from reacting with violence to violence. More than that, they speak of Woolf's own fall from innocence in accepting that it was no longer possible to be an Outsider, as she had advocated in Three Guineas, attacking patriarchal instincts and institutions from the radical margins: insiders and outsiders, Giles, Isa, William and Miss La Trobe, are necessarily in it together. 3 This concept of female complicity in the cycle of violence is relatively new for Woolf. She postulates in this last novel that women are not as far removed from the responsibilities of active citizenship as she had previously thought. No longer can women be seen as persons distinctly outside the political arena; menand womenas a whole are involved in the realities of war and violence, even if as an individual one is not committing the acts himself. Unlike Isa, Ms. La Trobe presents the reader with a strong, assertive personality that challenges the domesticity and submissiveness of her gender. But though La Trobe does occupy the role of a strong, assertive woman, it is imperative that the reader keep her actions in context. La Trobe is directing a yearly pageant in a small town that is not only unsuccessful, but also downright silly. What with the mishaps, forgotten lines, and the poorly-timed downpour, Miss La Trobe's pageant is a dud. Not to mention that the entire production of the pageant seems a bit futile; in the context of the impending war, the pageant seems a relic of more innocent times that do not quite fit with the climate in Britain. Admittedly, if done well, the play could have been a patriotic affirmation of the small town's love for their country, but considering the state of the actors, and the successor lack thereofof their acting, England, personified, is somewhat ridiculous. As Phyllis Jones opens the play, and repeatedly declares, England am I without continuing, the reader gets the sense not only that the country's fate is in limbo (this novel was written as England was deciding whether to get involved in the war or not), but also that La Trobe is cannot entirely escape from the relegation of the woman to a role silly and futile either. This idea of the individual versus his own and the collective past can most poignantly be seen in the last scene in the novel. As Miss La Trobe plans her next play, Isa and Giles find themselves alone, acting almost entirely within the bounds of La Trobe's imagination. The action appears scripted, as if the two are not behaving of their own accord, but rather on the directions of the play. The language used: Before they slept, they must fight; after they had fought, they would embrace implies an inevitability to their performance (Woolf 219). This last novel of Woolf's represents a move away from her earlier work in which her philosophy always seemed to be resolutely on the side of women's Otherness at the hand of men. In Between the Acts, Woolf gives a view of an equal responsibility of subjugation to both genders, intimating that both men and women contribute to the perpetuation of gender norms. This last novel represents Woolf's legacy and Bloomsbury's [as] the unfinished and unfinishable fight for civilizationpeace, freedom, art, beauty, sociabilitythat they hand on to the later generations of the whole world. 4 Writing Between the Acts in tandem with a biography of Roger Fry, Woolf is forced to revisit the past and look back into her own personal history. She discovers that the space that we create is indicative of our emotions, our history, and ultimately, our failures. Woolf understands, as she observes England making the same political mistakes, and as she re-examines her life vis-�-vis the life of Fry, that while perseverance may not always bring change, it is necessary for the eventual evolution of society.

ENG.G0.11.1,Bloom & Martha: Are You Not Happy in Your Home?,English,Argumentative Essay,"� Dear Henry, I got your last letter to me and thank you very much for it. I am sorry you did not like my last letter. Why did you enclose the stamps? I am awfully angry with you. I do wish I could punish you for that. I called you naughty boy because I do not like that other world. Please tell me what is the real meaning of that word? Are you not happy in your home you poor little naughty boy? I do wish I could do something for you. Please tell me what you think of poor me. I often think of the beautiful name you have. Dear Henry, when will we meet? I think of you so often you have no idea. I have never felt myself so much drawn to a man as you. I feel so bad about. Please write me a long letter and tell me more. Remember if you do not I will punish you. So now you know what I will do to you, you naughty boy, if you do not wrote. O how I long to meet you. Henry dear, do not deny my request before my patience are exhausted. Then I will tell you all. Goodbye now, naughty darling, I have such a bad headache. today. and write by return to your longing Martha P.S. Do tell me what kind of perfume does your wife use. I want to know. xxxx1 The reader, after trudging through the strange stream-of-consciousness and reference-heavy prose introducing her to Stephen and Bloom, finally encounters Martha's straightforward letter in Lotus-Eaters. The letter, at first, comes as a welcome changeas the reader easily digests the simple prose, free of difficult allusion. Martha's letter, still early in the narrative, proves a lotus-like escape for the reader, just as s/he assumes that this affair must provide some kind of escape for Bloom from his faulty marriage to Molly. Only after reading on in the novel does the reader learn the duplicitous nature of this letter's straightforward prosethat whenever Joyce offers her something easy to digest, it surely can't be so. Just as Father Conmee's simple and repetitive prose betrays his self-obsessed and delusional nature and Gerty MacDowell's clich�-ridden section demonstrates the influence and control advertising and popular culture hold over her identity, the reader should not approach Martha's letter as a narcotic escape from the difficulty of the text. Similarly, while Bloom and Martha's epistolary affair might at first seem an exciting escape from his faulty marriage, both Bloom's immediate treatment of the letter and the reoccurrences of Martha's words throughout the text imply that the affair works no better as an escape for Bloom than for the readerit actually confronts him with his actions in light of the his struggling marriage to Molly. On first reading, the letter's unadorned prose proves refreshing, but many of Martha's syntactical and grammatical errors betray her awkward bravado. Martha's trip-up, I do not like that other world, (substituting world for word) for example, could, with a Freudian slip, refer to the real worldoutside of the couple's fantasy relationship. And even if Martha's slip up holds no significance for her own situation, it certainly holds plenty for Bloom's, whose other world crumbles throughout the day. Additionally, the letter seems made up of sentiments alternately sad and longing, and tawdry and flirtymaking the flirtation appear difficult and somewhat pitiful. Martha's are you not happy in your home you poor little naughty boy? exhibits this perfectly. The question are you not happy in your home? feels poignant and especially pertinent for the day, but Martha's calling Bloom a poor little naughty boy reminds the reader how much this letter operates as a performance. Thus, the flirtation complicates the questionseemingly asking, is that why we're doing this? Because you aren't happy in your home? Additionally, several of Martha's truncated sentences seem to omit words that might truthfully speak to how difficult her situation, and Bloom's marital situation have actually become. When she writes, I feel so bad about, she could potentially refer to her relationship with Bloom, or perhaps, how this affair reminds the two of them of that other world, and how their lives have pushed them into an affair with no substance beyond little black marks on paper. And later, when Martha tells that I have such a bad headache. today, the setting aside of today, if not speaking to Martha's struggle with grammar or her own day, reminds the reader how much more poorly June 16th is going for Bloom than just a simple migraine could indicate. Though the simple prose of the letter proves refreshing, many of Martha's words and errors still complicate it for the readerwithin the context of Bloom and Martha's relationshipwhen s/he takes a closer look. Though Bloom's covertness in picking up and disposing of Martha's letter suggests its importancehe feels the letter far too steamy and private to risk any discoveryhis emotional reaction to the letter renders the affair more inert and benign. The supposed affair only takes place on paperand that likely will never change. Bloom seems somewhat happy with the message, but only weak joy opened his lips, not a more pressing or intense emotion (emphasis added). And just following, Bloom pokes fun at Martha's poor grammar, as he wonder[s] did she wrote it herself (64). He obviously thinks of himself as intellectually superior to his correspondent, thus assuaging any of the reader's suspicion that he and Martha share a deep cerebral bond. On that account, it appears as though Bloom intends to keep the affair innocuous; as he remembers Martha's offer to meet one Sunday after the rosary, he thinks, thank you: not having any. Usual love scrimmage(64). He would rather keep the relationship in the realm of the imagined. Bloom treats the letter with weak joy, gentle mockery, and vague disinterest upon first reading it, indicating the innocuous nature of his affair. At this point in the narrative Bloom's still might view the affair as, like a good cigar, narcotic. Go further next time&try it anyhow (64). However, as Martha's words resurface again and again, the reader sees how many more complicated ways they can work in, and also how Bloom's affair with Martha keeps him from escaping thoughts of his marriage, but rather encourages his return to themjust as he will eventually return home. In Lestrygonians, the language from Martha's letter resurfaces in Bloom's thoughts, further complicating the content of her letter for the reader and demonstrating how for Bloom, the affair works terribly as an escape. When Bloom remembers his younger love with Molly in Lestrygonians, and how when we left Lombard street west something changed. Could never like it again after Rudy, he wonders, would you go back to then? Just beginning then. Would you? Are you not happy in your home you poor little naughty boy? (137). The resurfacing of his letter from Martha jars the reader. It reminds her that Bloom, while pining for his past with the cuckolding Molly, has exploredto a far lesser extenta certain degree of infidelity himself. At the same time, though, the language helps Bloom to ask this question of himself, and even in its asking, answers itself: of course not. This reminder of the tawdriness of Bloom's affair seems to clarify for the reader Bloom's longing for a real relationship and connection with Molly, his wife. Bloom comes back to the letter more frequently in Sirens, and understandably so; the clock moves closer to four, Boylan comes into the bar, and Bloom's thoughts circle around infidelity as he decides to write Martha back. As Boylan walks into the bar, and Bloom mentally tries to put the man down, thinking he can't sing for tall hats, and imagines Molly being perfumed for him, again Martha's words come back to him: what perfume does your wife? I want to know (225). If Bloom thinks about Martha's letter in an effort to distract himself from thinking about Boylan and Molly, the effort fails. His thoughts return to his wife's affair: Jing. Stop. Knock. Last look at mirror always before she answers the door (225). Later on in Sirens, when Lionel sings Martha, Bloom recalls his own Martha's words again: can't write. Accept my little pres. Play on her heartstrings pursestrings too. She's a. I called you a naughty boy (226). Here the prose moves in a truncated fashion, and Martha's words form the only full sentence in the paragraph, excluding Bloom's Martha it is, and his exclamation at the end, how strange! Again, the closer and closer it gets to four, the more Bloom can't concentrate on anything but his wife's pending affair with Boylan, to the extent that he can't write (226). Additionally, though, the truncated style of prose reminds the reader how Ulysses constantly complicates, churns around, and repeats its own material. Martha's originally simple letter now finds itself wrapped up into the percussive prose of Sirensrefusing a simpler first reading. The sentences shortness might also come because as Bloom tries to write Martha back, he obviously struggles with the actand with trying to mouth one thing and write another. Just as the affair proves no escape for Bloom, Bloom's thoughts and the complex and shifting prose of Ulysses complicates the reader's encounter with the affair as well. In articulating this struggle, the book won't release full sentences or words: my patience are exhaust. To keep it up. You must believe (230). However, Bloom's admitting to his struggle to write Martha backif even in this thoughtsseems to display how his epistolary relationship with Martha has the ability to extract some truthfulness from him. At the end of the letter, he even manages to write, I feel so sad today (230). Though he obviously still performs this sentiment, and second-guesses himself moments later, Bloom's admission to Martha serves as one of the most honest communications Bloom has all morning. The relationship, a failed escape, brings Bloom face to face with the true difficulty of his situation and his day. If the reader sympathizes significantly with Bloom in Sirens, s/he likely does less so in Nausicaa, when Bloom's infidelity becomes more active and tangible as he masturbates to Gerty MacDowell. Bloom again recalls Martha's words, as he writes a message in the sand: I, he writes, then thinks what is the meaning of that other world. I called you a naughty boy because I do not like. AM. A (312). Bloom, of course, never finishes his sentence. Just as he almost defines himself by scrawling a declaration in the sand, his thoughts again trace back to Martha's letter. This time, though, his recent encounter with Gerty complicates the memory. Now he truly has done something naughty, which likely contributes to his struggle to define himself. Bloom drops his writing tool in the sand, no room. Let it go and the narrative winds on. Again, the complicated nature of Ulysseswhich could never release in direct, simple language what Bloom actually isregurgitates Martha's words, using this piece of her letter to remind the reader how far the text can travel. Bloom, more directly associates his encounters with Gerty, Martha, and his wife when, after Gerty has drained all the manhood out of [him], he remembers writing Martha care of P.O. Dolphin's Barn. Are you not happy in your? Naughty darling (308-309). Coming immediately after this recollection, Bloom's thoughts again turn to his wife. He thinks of: Dolphin's barn charades in Luke Doyle's house, the occasion when, as the reader learns from Molly in Penelope, he kissed my heart at Dolphins barn I couldnt describe it simply it makes you feel like nothing on earth (615). In this passage the reader encounters the complicated ways that Martha's letter resurfaces, as s/he cannot actually understand the full significance of Bloom's Dolphin's Barn ponderings until the final chapter in the book. Though Bloom's thoughts hint towards the Dolphin's Barn encounter earlier on in the text in Calypso (52) and Lestrygonians (130), the reader never fully comprehends the encounter, if they even ever make the connection, until Molly describes it in Penelope. Thus Molly's assertion regarding her kiss with Bloom, I couldnt describe it simply, could work as a synecdoche both for how Martha's letterand the book as wellwork: Joyce lets nothing, not Martha's letter, not Bloom and Molly's relationship, stay simple, or stagnant throughout the text. Martha's letter resurfaces in complex and unpredictable ways. Here, it challenges the reader to bring together two seemingly inconsequential details; Bloom's relationship with the two women hinges on this Dolphin's Barn Lane location. Every time Bloom writes to Martha, or receives a letter from her care of the Dolphin's Barn Lane post office, he likely remembers this heart-kiss with his wife. Just as masturbating to Gerty MacDowell fails to provide an escape for Bloom, each letter to Martha care of Dolphin's Barn Lane must necessarily remind him that his relationship with Molly no longer makes him, or her, feel like nothing on earth. And Bloom seems to realize this a few moments after he remembers that night of charades in Nausicaa, when he ponders how [you] think you're escaping and run into yourself (309). Both his epistolary affair with Martha and his masturbation to Gerty remind him of the complicated and imperfect state of his marriage. And this line could just as well apply to the readerwho first encounters Martha's letter with relief, feeling it an escapebut later reads the resurfacing of the words with more confusion and difficulty, running into herself, as s/he learns that nothing in Ulysses stays as simple as it first seems. In parallel to the way Bloom wanders Dublin, at first avoiding and then returning to his home, Martha's letter at first seems to provide escape, but eventually returns him to thoughts of his marriage. The reader of Ulysses, too, must constantly establish and reestablish a home, or place of comfort within the text. Driven away from the kind of reading s/he is accustomed to, the reader must find new ways of approaching the repetition, truncated prose, and references that demand ongoing reinterpretation of Martha's letter's place in the textamong other thoughts and events. Failing to explore many of Ulysses' complexities might leave the reader feeling like a touristseeing the sights but never fully understanding them. But to encounter the book as an object both shifting and static, and to explore the narrative both as familiarwith a plot line, characters, and a settingand foreignin which the relationship of the reader to the text constantly cycles and shiftscreates a home like Bloom's: a challenge to get to, but rewarding upon arrival.

ENG.G0.12.1,Women in Beowulf,English,Argumentative Essay,"Equality is a highly regarded goal in today's society; laws are designed to ensure equal treatment of all people, across different socioeconomic, ethnic and gender classifications. Along with the aim of gender equality is the goal of reaching equality through identical treatment of men and women. This modern mindset may influence a reader's perception of the power held by the women in Beowulf. On the surface, Queen Wealhtheow and Grendel's mother are dominated by men. However, both women actually have a great deal of power; it is simply manifested differently than the power of male figures. Queen Wealhtheow initially seems to be a powerless woman dominated by the men around her. The reader is first introduced to Wealhtheow as she passes a cup around to the men, in the role of hostess. The fact that Wealhtheow is serving the men makes it seem as though she is subservient to them; however, this is not the case. Wealhtheow is not merely doing the men's bidding; rather, she is fulfilling the necessary tradition of recognizing a complex social hierarchy. It is her responsibility to serve the men, as a show of respect, in the correct sequence, Wealhtheow came in,Hrothgar's queen, observing the courtesies.Adorned in her gold, she graciously salutedthe men in the hall, then handed the cupfirst to Hrothgar, their homeland's guardian,&so the helming woman went on her rounds,queenly and dignified, decked out in rings.offering the goblet to all rankstreating the household and the assembled troop,until it was Beowulf's turn to take it from her hand. (lines 612-624) If Wealhtheow were to disregard her duties as Queen by not serving the men in the correct order, they would be offended. By following her responsibilities, Wealhtheow is maintaining peace and stability among her people. Wealhtheow herself wants the best for her people, as seen in lines 625-628, With measured words she welcomed the Geat / and thanked God for granting her wish / that a deliverer she could believe in would arrive / to ease their afflictions. Wealhtheow is not being forced by a man to fulfill her duties; rather she does so out of her own desire for the well-being of her kingdom. Wealhtheow, with the intent of protecting her kingdom and family, wields her power in a couple of different ways. Not only can she wield her power by promoting peace through her complex role as hostess, but she also uses the power she has as a queen to warn the men about Hrothulf. In a society where honor and respect are so important, it would be unheard of for Wealhtheow to overtly challenge the motives of a powerful male ally. However, within the social constraints she is bound by, Wealhtheow warns her people about Hrothulf. With her clever speech, she attempts to secure the safety of her sons and kingdom, by drawing attention to Hrothulf and entreating Beowulf to monitor his actions. Unlike the men around her, Wealhtheow does not appear blind to the possibility of Hrothulf's betrayal, &Wealhtheow came to sit / in her gold crown between two good men, / uncle and nephew, each one of whom / still trusted the other... (1161-1164). The men's trust for each other is explicitly stated, however, nothing is said of Wealtheow's trust. It is with ulterior motives that she does mention her faith in Hrothulf in her speech, I am certain of Hrothulf.He is noble and will use the young ones well.He will not let you down. Should you die before him,he will treat our children truly and fairly.he will honor, I am sure, our two sons,repay them in kind, when he recollectsall the good things we gave him once,the favor and respect he found in his childhood. (1179-1186) As queen, Wealhtheow is given the opportunity to make speeches to the public; she chooses to use this power to try to protect her sons, while the king does not. Wealhtheow's speech is a reminder to Hrothulf that he has an obligation to treat her children fairly. She even goes as far as to explicitly reference Hrothulf's debt to repay the kindness he has been given. Wealhtheow makes the speech in a public forum so everyone, especially Beowulf, will be reminded of the behavior expected from Hrothulf. Wealhtheow does not have the physical strength to protect her sons; however, she makes every attempt available to her to secure their safety. Ultimately, the reason Hrothulf is successful in his usurpation is because the men fail to recognize and act upon Wealhtheow's warning. Although Wealhtheow's presentation of gifts to Beowulf may seem to signal his dominance, the gifts are actually a further indication of Wealhtheow's power. She contributes more to the likelihood of a positive outcome for her people than the king or any other male does, by bestowing these vitally important gifts on Beowulf. The first gift Wealhtheow gives, the torque, is a sign of commitment and trust between her people and the Geats. She knows Beowulf is a powerful ally and that, by binding her people to Beowulf, she is increasing the kingdom's strength. Wealhtheow gives an important speech as she presents the gifts to Beowulf, Take delight in this torque, dear Beowulf,wear it for luck and wear also this mailfrom our people's armory: may you prosper in them!Be acclaimed for strength, for kindly guidanceto these two boys, and your bounty will be sure.You have won renown: you are known to all menfar and near, now and forever.Your sway is wide as the wind's home,as the sea around cliffs. And so, my prince, I wish you a lifetime's luck and blessings.to enjoy this treasure. Treat my sonswith tender care, be strong and kind. (1216-1227) Wealhtheow flatters Beowulf in her speech, to endear herself to him. She knows Beowulf is a powerful ally and that it would be in her kingdom's, as well as her sons', best interest to be in his favor. She has the same motivation for giving him the torque. Wealhtheow's gift of the mail is evidence that she is also a powerful ally who can offer Beowulf protection. In fact, without the chain mail, Beowulf would not have been victorious in his later battle against another powerful woman, Grendel's mother. Like Wealhtheow, on the surface Grendel's mother appears to be dominated by male figures. In fact, she is eventually killed by Beowulf. However, when examined more closely, it is clear that Grendel's mother is a very powerful figure in her own right. Like Wealhtheow, she has a strong desire to do what is right for her son. Grendel's mother apparently lived peacefully for many years and never attacked Heorot, until she decided to protect her son's honor and seek revenge for his death, grief-racked and ravenous, desperate for revenge.She came to Heorot. There, inside the hall,Danes lay asleep, earls who would soon endure a great reversal, once Grendel's motherattacked and entered. Her onslaught was less only by as much as an amazon warrior'sstrength is less than an armed man's&Then in the hall, hard-honed swordswere grabbed from the bench, many a broad shieldlifted and braced; there was little thought of helmetsor woven mail when they woke in terror.The hell-dam was in panic, desperate to get out,in mortal terror the moment she was found. (1278-1293) Grendel's mother is clearly powerful enough to inspire grave fear in the warriors. She is not free of fear herself, yet she is courageous enough to risk herself to achieve her goals of getting revenge for her son's death and honoring his memory. Grendel's mother succeeds in getting revenge against the Danes, especially King Hrothgar, when she seizes Aeschere, She had pounced and taken one of the retainersin a tight hold, then headed for the fen.To Hrothgar, this man was the most beloved of the friends he trusted between the two seas.She had done away with a great warrior,ambushed him at rest. (1294-1298) It is not a coincidence that Grendel's mother takes Aeschere, the King's most trusted advisor; Beowulf is not present, thus Aeschere is the next best victim. Grendel's mother is clearly victorious in her attack, even though she is far outnumbered by the men. Grendel's mother protects her son's dignity and honors his memory by reclaiming his arm, There was uproar in Heorot. She had snatched their trophy, / Grendel's bloodied hand. (1302-1303). Although her feelings toward her son urge Grendel's mother into battle, it is ultimately her decision to attack Heorot. During the attack, she proves her physical superiority over the men and manages to take two worthy prizes; the king's favorite man and the arm of her son. Grendel's mother is eventually physically dominated, when she is killed by Beowulf. However, Beowulf is only triumphant because of contributions from both Wealhtheow and Grendel's mother. Beowulf initially tries to slay Grendel's mother using only his own resources, however his sword fails, The hero observed that swamp-thing from hell,the tarn-hag in all her terrible strength, then heaved his war-sword and swung his arm: the decorated blade came down ringingand singing on her head. But he soon found his battle-torch extinguished; the shining blade refused to bite. It spared her and failedthe man in his need. It had gone through manyhand-to hand fight, had hewed the armorand helmets of the doomed, but here at lastthe fabulous powers of that heirloom failed. (1518-1528). Even though Beowulf has used his sword to kill many men in the past, it is no match for Grendel's mother. Her power is too great to be conquered by Beowulf and his weapons alone. Grendel's mother gains the advantage in the battle and is about to kill Beowulf, when he is saved by the armor given to him by Wealhtheow, The sure-footed fighter felt daunted,the strongest of warriors stumbled and fell.So she pounced upon him and pulled outa broad, whetted knife: now she would avengeher only child. But the mesh of chain-mailon Beowulf's shoulder shielded his life,turned the edge and tip of the blade.The son of Ecgtheow would have surely perished and the Geats lost their warrior under the wide earth had the strong links and locks of his war-gearnot helped to save him& (1543-1553) Were it not for Wealhtheow's gift of protection, Grendel's mother would have succeeded in killing Beowulf. Her power was great enough to cause Beowulf's death; however, the strength of Wealhtheow's gift prevented her from doing so. Beowulf is able to finally overcome Grendel's mother only after he steals her sword, Then he saw a blade that boded well / a sword in her armory, an ancient heirloom, (1557-1558). Beowulf cannot defeat Grendel's mother with his own assets; he must steal a sword from her realm. The narrator credits God for Beowulf's success, rather than recognizing the women's contributions. Yet, it is unlikely that God would have anything to do with providing the sword Beowulf uses to kill Grendel's mother. Beowulf found the sword in the evil realm of Grendel's mother, which is a place God does not have any association with. Therefore, although Beowulf caused Grendel's mother's death, his strength is still overshadowed by the power of the women. Beowulf needed the protection of the armor given to him by Wealhtheow, as well as the strength of the sword that he stole from Grendel's mother, in order to be victorious. Although it superficially seems the women do not have power equal to that of the males, in reality the issue is much more complicated. These women are not weak figures dominated by men; rather they wield much power in the lives of the men around them. Wealhtheow helps maintain the stability and peace of her kingdom, while doing her best to provide protection to her people. Grendel's mother exerts a great deal of physical power, but also gets revenge for her son while protecting and honoring his memory. These accomplishments may not be seen by the modern reader as typical displays of power. However, while the power of Wealhtheow and Grendel's mother may manifest itself in a different fashion than that of their male counterparts, its existence is undeniable.

ENG.G0.13.1,The Love Covenant,English,Argumentative Essay,"The book of Hosea presents a different view of God's relationship with Israel than many of the previous books. The extended metaphor employed in Hosea 2: 2-4 portrays God as Israel's husband, but, more precisely, its spurned lover. This metaphor lays the foundation for a new portrayal of God's covenant with Israel, a covenant of love, which is detailed throughout the book. The metaphor of God as Israel's lover highlights a new sense of the relationship God has with his people. The God in this passage (Hosea 2: 2-4) is not the unfeeling and indiscriminately violent God presented earlier in the Bible. One example of this earlier idea of God is in GenesisAnd God said to Noah, 'I have determined to make an end to all flesh, for the earth is filled with violence&now I am going to destroy them along with the earth' (Genesis 6: 13). In contrast, Hosea's God is intimate with IsraelPlead&that she put away whoring from her face, and her adultery from between her breasts& (Hosea 2:2). The metaphor makes God very human-like and his jealous anger can be understood in the realm of human emotion. His anger is notably softer than pervious accounts where God would simply strike down any offenders. For example, in the book of Exodus, God tells Moses, 'Whoever has sinned against me I will blot out of my book&I will punish them for their sin&' Then the LORD sent a plague on the people& (Exodus 32: 33-35). In Hosea, God's anger is also passionate; the lines in Hosea suggest an image of a man whose passionate love is mixed with passionate jealousy as he remembers the look of his lover's face and the shape of her breasts. The memories are soft, but deeply painful as the husband laces them with their new marks of sinhis lover turns into a promiscuous wife as her face becomes whoring and her breasts cradle adultery. His violence is also intensely personal. Rape imagery is employed as the spurned lover threatens to strip her naked and expose her in order to punish the wife's sins (Hosea 2:3). This is no longer a God who dictates and punishes from above at a removed distance, but one who wishes to make Israel suffer for its crimes. The punishment outlined for the adulterous woman parallels the slow way God will punish Israel. This punishment is of abandonmentmake her like a wildernessand of slow deathturn her into a parched land, and kill her with thirst (Hosea 2: 3). The metaphor turns God into the angry man who finds out his wife has taken other lovers and then systematically outlines the detailed ways of his vengeance. He is so angry that he will even dismiss his children in order to punish her. Upon her children also I will have no pity, because they are children of whoredom (Hosea 2: 4). However, it is exactly this intense and detailed jealousy which illustrates the love between the man and the woman, between God and Israel. If he did not love so deeply, so passionately, he would not be so offended or take the time to punish so thoroughly. In this way, the metaphor of God and Israel as lovers sets up the covenant as a covenant of love which is prevalent throughout the book of Hosea. This covenant appears different than past representations of God's covenant with Israel. In Exodus, the covenant stated that Israel needed to heed God's commandments. In Hosea, the covenant seems less specific and more human; God desires steadfast love and not sacrifice, the knowledge of God rather than burnt offerings (Hosea 6: 6). This covenant requires that the Israelites love God steadfastly without becoming adulterous and loving other gods. Hosea's metaphor certainly reestablishes the idea of the covenant as one of love, but it is unclear why this new covenant is expressed here or why it is important. It does seem important to Hosea to weave together the old ideas of the covenant with this new covenant about love. He seems to want to unite the previous notion of a wrathful God with his new version of a loving God, and the text vacillates between the two. At one point the text reads, ...therefore the tumult of war shall rise against your people, and all your fortresses shall be destroyed, as&when mothers were dashed in pieces with their children (Hosea 10: 14). Very shortly after the tone of God changes drasticallyI led them with cords of human kindness, with bands of love (Hosea 11: 4). The text is silent about how these two different portrayals of God actually fit together. Again, it is unclear why the covenant in presented as one of love in Hosea. One idea is that the book of Hosea is trying to reinterpret the covenant so as to end the repetitive cycle of the Israelites breaking covenant which exists throughout the Bible. In a way, it seems as though Hosea realizes that the original presentation of the relationship between God and Israel has a history of failing, and it may be helpful to create a new version of that relationship. Hosea attempts this by making God more human-like and giving him human emotions that the people would be able to understand. The employment of the lovers metaphor also allows the Israelites to understand their relationship with God by basing it off human experiences with love. Going along with the idea of strengthening a covenant that seems again and again to be too weak is Hosea's idea that love is the strongest bond. This book may be seen as Hosea's final effort to bond the Israelites to God before Israel is taken. Hosea may see the use of love then as the motivation needed to inspire the people to stay with God. With the old covenant it was necessary for Israel to fear punishment for abandoning God. However, this punishment was God's wrath and destruction. Hosea employs a much more powerful fearthe fear of losing love. The threat now is not that God will just be angry, but that he will hate them, will drive them out of [his] house, and will love them no more (Hosea 9: 15). Losing someone who once loved them is much worse than losing someone who never loved them. The need for this love covenant may also have grown out of what was going on at the point in time Hosea was a prophet. In the first covenant between God and Israel, the people had been suffering under Egyptian rule and God had brought them out of slavery. They had nothing and relied on God to protect them. However, at the time of Hosea, it appears that the Israelites are doing fairly well. They have established themselves on their land and are no longer poor. A God who can provide for them may not seem as necessary; it may be easy for this generation to forget God since they no longer need to ask him for help. So then in order to bring the Israelites to God, Hosea may use the idea of love since one can endlessly aspire for love. In the original covenant, the people asked for and God provided them manna, but here the people need to strive for his love. There is no longer something concrete and tangible to receive from God, but something abstract. When the Israelites received the manna, or whatever else it was they desired, it was easy then to forget God. However, since they can never truly know if they have God's love, they must work for it forever. Love may be the strongest motivation for action and Hosea uses it to his advantage. The love covenant may also be presented here to inspire repentance among the Israelites. In the past, the notion of covenant has been absolute. If the people obey God, he will protect them. If the people disobey God, he will abandon or destroy them. If the people come back to God, he will return to them. However, the covenant in Hosea does not seem to be so concrete. The book presents the idea of needing to heal one's relationship with God, just as a husband and wife would work to heal a problematic relationship. The important twist in this idea of healing is that it is God who creates the wound by taking away his love, but also happens to be the only one who can heal the wound by returning his love. This is pointed out in Hosea: When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah his wound, then Ephraim went to Assyria, and sent to the great king. But he is not able to cure you or heal your wound (Hosea 5: 13). In this way, the love covenant leaves no room for other Gods or other kings if the Israelites wish to be healed. The blurred lines of this covenant allow for temporary punishment that may inspire repentance. Much like the angry husband who cannot help but still love his adulterous wife, God will also take back his people. They seem to know that it is he who has torn, and he will heal us; he has struck down, and he will bind us up. After two days he will revive us; on the third day he will raise us up, that we may live before him (Hosea 6: 1-2). The strongest part of the covenant may be that in this idea of covenant God never truly abandons his people; even though he threatens to deny them love, he cannot do so. This may be more effective in motivating the people to admit their sins and return to God then if they thought of God's anger and abandonment as absolute. The promiscuous wife will be more inclined to return to her husband if he is temporarily angry then if he cuts her off completely. It is uncertain why the book of Hosea employs this idea of the covenant between God and Israel as a covenant based on love. However, while there are confusion and holes in the text, it seems that Hosea does present the idea of the covenant successfully or persuasively. The first metaphor of God and Israel as lovers creates the foundation for the ideas and human emotions that course through the rest of the book. These ideas then expand into even greater metaphors about God's love covenant that seem almost too big to be contained by the small book of Hosea. The successful presentation of the covenant as love rests on an important ending in Hosea. The lovers reconcile. I will heal their disloyalty; I will love them freely, for my anger has turned from them. I will be like the dew to Israel& they shall again live beneath my shadow (Hosea 14: 4-7).

ENG.G0.14.1,James Joyce: A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man,English,Argumentative Essay,"Stephen's visualization of Hell is juxtaposed with its traditional description provided by the Catholic Church in Chapter Three of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. These two detailed versions are paradoxically similar and dissimilar at the same time. Both destinations are characterized by: repetitive diction; the torment of the sinner's visionary, auditory, and olfactory senses; open-mouthed images of the damned, their eternal murmurings, foul stenches, and suffocating filth (122). The principle difference between the two versions is that the Church's fundamental focus on eternal punishment utilizes physical torture, which, interestingly, Stephen's Hell completely lacks. While the idea of an eternity with physical torture is understandably frightening to his peers at Clongowes, Stephen's Hell is far more personal and intellectually gruesome; its imagery is borrowed from his past experiences and serves to aggravate his innermost horrors. It appeals to unconscious fears that, for him, supersede physical pain: the soiling of something otherwise innocent; mental and physical paralysis; and his family's impending poverty. For Stephen, all of these obstacles are fatal to the obsessively scripted life of his imaginingwhich is his greatest fear of all. His visualization of Hell can be viewed as a detailed composition of imaginative art that is ultimately a personal triumph over both the oppressive Church and his greatest fear. The pastoral imagery of the landscape and its creatures is fundamental to Stephen's vision of Hell and unquestionably echoes the cowyard scene in chapter two when he sees for the first time a field empty of the cattle which had seemed so beautiful(63). He laments over the filthy cowyard at Stradbrook with its foul green puddles and clots of liquid dung (63), and defines his sudden feelings of revulsion towards cattle as to the point that he could not even look at the milk they yielded (63). Stephen's visual and olfactory accounts of his Hell deeply mirror that of this cowyard scene, describing the landscape as: A field of stiff weeds& Thick among the tufts of rank stiff growth lay battered canisters and clots and coils of solid excrement and stale crusted dung (137). Also strikingly similar between these two scenes are the animals referenced: cattle and goatsboth of which are pastoral animals that produce milk. The presence of the goats in Stephen's Hell correspond to the revulsion experienced in chapter two with the defilement of the cattle which he originally found beautiful. Both scenes speak directly to his fear of the otherwise pure and innocent becoming spoiled and dirty. This concept has profound resonances of Catholicism and proves to be a constant struggle for Stephen throughout the novel due to his rigorous Catholic upbringing. The goatish creatures' importance extend beyond their representation of spoiled innocence. There is a marked significance behind the repetitive and counterproductive nature of their rhythmic motions: essentially movements and shapes that have no endpoint. To emphasize this, Joyce utilizes onomatopoeia to name and describe the endless hither and thither motiona motion that continuously reverses its previous movement and thus lacks progress. Consequently, this motion signifies both eternity and paralysis. To add to the stagnation, this winding hither and thither phrase describes the individual movement of each creature within the more uniform yet still futile movement of all six creatures collectively in slow circles (thus, still lacking progress and finality). The phrase hither and thither is reused often throughout the remainder of the book following Stephen's vision of Hell. It is generally his own unconscious reference to his current state of paralysis: either mental as on page 161: a din of meaningless words drove his reasoned thoughts hither and thither confusedly; or physical as with his inability to approach the seabird girl moving her foot in the same fashion at the end of Chapter four. This paralysis of thought and action is yet another obstacle that Stephen struggles with during his childhood and adolescent years. The remaining details of this composition are the initially puzzling images of a torn flannel waistcoat (138) worn by one of the goatish creatures and the two references to battered/rattling canisters (137/138). While their presence is seemingly inappropriate in a destination such as Hell, these images are meaningful if the Dedalus family's fast-approaching poverty is taken into account. The nature of the material is important; flannel is known for its ability to sustain warmth, thus originally making it popular among blue-collar workers in cold environments, such as farmers. Also significant is the quality of the waistcoat, being in a torn and weathered state. Furthermore, the scanty clothing is mirrored by the animal that wears it: a farm animal, thus also alluding to blue collar individuals--possibly more specifically to the impoverished state of Irish farmers during the period in which the novel takes place. When the waistcoat is coupled with that of the dump-like presence of rattling canisters, the reader can understand that these images are indicative of Stephen's fear of poverty. Stephen's vision of Hell is a triumph for him for various reasons. First, he has triumphed over the Church, freeing himself of the images and fears they attempted to forcefully instill in him and instead fearing only that which is relevant to his life. Secondly, it is an artistic triumph, as his composition--though less violent--is insurmountably more eerie and terrible than the theatrically trite version provided by the preacher. Finally and incredibly ironically, Stephen's composition is in fact a triumph over his greatest fear itself. His Hell is comprised of obstacles capable of spoiling the carefully controlled life scripted in his mind. In imagining such a place, Stephen has succeeding in scripting, and thus controlling, all that he fears most.

ENG.G0.15.1,Anna Karenina,English,Argumentative Essay,"Though the appearances of Constantine Levin's brother Nicholas in Anna Karenina are limited to a handful of scenes depicting his rapidly declining health and eventual prolonged death, their dramatic intensity and the lasting impressions that they leave on Kostya render them memorable and key to the progression of the novel nonetheless. Tolstoy employs Nicholas's fiercely liberal, communist-leaning political stances and his frequently radical intellectual and social viewpoints as a rather convenient vehicle for commentary on Russian society. Yet even more salient to the novel as a whole is Nicholas' role in prompting his brother's recurring existential contemplations of G-d and death and the way in which his demise ultimately functions to facilitate a deeper, more intimate union between Kitty and Levin. Kitty's proclivity for dealing rationally and comfortably with imminent death while her husband stands by, horrified and practically helpless in his cerebral contemplations of the situation, arouses poignant feelings of love and respect within Levin. Furthermore, on a more technical level, the revelation of Kitty's pregnancy coincides directly with the moment of Nicholas' death, thus completing a life-cycle of sorts within the novel. Nicholas' role in Anna Karenina gains its significance most prominently from the impact of his life on Kostya, as he possesses a unique ability to disturb [Levin's] innermost thoughts, (316) serving as a muse for his philosophical ruminations, compelling him to acknowledge the inextricable ties between life and death, and aiding his quest for the discovery of meaning in human existence. Tolstoy introduces Nicholas quite early on and wastes no time in depicting him as a difficult, standoffish, somewhat repellent character, and moreover a ruined man who had squandered the greatest part of his fortune, mixed with the strangest and worst society, and quarreled with his brothers (24). No sooner does Nicholas gain his first mention in the novel than he becomes a source of mental anxiety for his brother Constantine, who because of Nicholas begins to feel that [He] cannot be at peace since a struggle was going on within him between the desire to forget his unfortunate brother for the present, and the consciousness that this would be wrong(24). Though at this point Levin temporarily casts aside the thought of Nicholas as he prepares to visit with Kitty, his brother soon resurfaces in his mind when Levin asks himself is he not right that everything on earth is evil and horrid? (77). Thus the gloom permeating Levin's mind as he thinks of his pessimistic brother prompts him to look harshly upon the world with dark-colored glasses and temporarily integrate a dose of Nicholas' negativity into his own perspective. These periods of negativity are a key phase of the maturation process that Levin undergoes during the novel, and only by traversing through can he emerge triumphant in the glories of life by the book's end. Levin notably expresses a degree of sympathy for Nicholas and even compares himself directly to his unfortunate and oft-ridiculed sibling, noting that, I know his soul, and know that we resemble on another (77). The function of this comparison is twofold, as it initially forges a meaningful connection between the two brothers and thereby highlights for the reader the fact that Nicholas will play a vital role in Levin's story, and then it further inclines one to pity Nicholas and look upon him more kindly because he is juxtaposed directly with one of the novel's more reputable and upstanding characters. Levin's dedication to defending his brother as no worse than those who despised him (78) grants Nicholas credibility, paving the way for him to considerably influence the course of events in the book. Tolstoy contributes to the pathos of Nicholas' character through his use of physiognomy, describing his eyes with their peculiar, na�ve gaze which light up with joy upon recognizing his brother, and his generally awkward, blundering manner (80). He also relates that Nicholas has taken in a former whore, Mary Nikolaevna, to live with him as his wife, and while this action does not increase the respectability of his image, it does show that he is a man not altogether lacking in compassion, for he demands that those who wish to know him must love and respect her (80). During his first meeting with Nicholas, Constantine tellingly admits to himself that his brother is unfortunate and needed friendship (83) and subsequently vows that he will never allow himself to forget him again, but would watch over him, keep him in sight, and be ready to help when things went hard with him (85). This revelation on Levin's part forecasts the extent to which Nicholas' tragic story will come to affect Levin. Many of the details accompanying Nicholas' various appearances in the novel paint him in a disagreeable light, yet because of Kostya's consistent efforts to identify with his brother and vindicate his characteristically abrasive behavior, one cannot easily dismiss Nicholas as simply an embittered misanthrope, but rather must instead give him due attention as a relevant and purposeful character, and one whose life resonates with many of the novel's most crucial themes. Nicholas remains characteristically present in Levin's mind even after the latter's return to Moscow, when remembering his brother Nicholas, he begins to reflect on communism and the state of the economy, resolving in light of the vast economic disparities he perceives between peasants and landowners to, work still more and allow himself still less luxury (85). In this moment the seed that will become his book about the nature of the laborer in agriculture begins to germinate, and his determination to work in the fields among his peasants rather than live idly off of their labor gains substantial momentum. These resolutions are integral to Levin's character and remain central to him throughout the novel, continually influencing his behavior. Here they have their impetus in his considerations of former conversations with Nicholas, thus revealing that the influence of Levin's brother lies at the core of his developing social and moral ideology. Later encounters with Nicholas will also precipitate evolutions in Levin's thinking process. A few months after this first episode, when Nicholas arrives to visit Levin at his estate, Levin initially worries that Nicholas, who knew him through and through&would force him to make a clean breast of things, but upon actually greeting his brother, his feeling of disappointment vanished and was replaced by pity (316). Thus Levin privately acknowledges Nicholas' powerful sway over him and admits that he fears the extent of his brother's influence, but because he is promptly consumed by pity and compassion when confronted by the emaciated figure of his ailing brother, he ultimately cannot escape this profound influence. In accordance with the recurring pattern that manifests whenever Levin spends time with his brother, his mind plunges deeply into thought the night after Nicholas' arrival, and he lies awake nearly all night contemplating death, the inevitable end of everything, bemoaning that I want to do something, and I had forgotten that it will all end in Death! (318). As the novel's human embodiment of misfortune and death, Nicholas' presence haunts Levin because he does not yet know how to integrate suffering and death into his ideas about life. Nicholas repeatedly spurs Levin into profound contemplations, forcing him to confront difficult and often moribund topics that might not otherwise occupy his thoughts, but Nicholas' demise will eventually give Levin the opportunity to synthesize key notions of sickness and death into what he already knows about life. Thus while in this instance Nicholas' poor health and nearness to death confound and distress Levin, sending him spiraling into philosophical deliberations on the new, insoluble problem of death (319), Nicolas will ultimately provide philosophical resolution for Levin through his passing, and death will evolve from an insoluble problem to a natural part of life. These ruminations on death and the impenetrable problems of life echo the end of the novel, when Levin comes close to suicide because he cannot find a suitable system of beliefs to endow his life with meaning. The crisis of existence that Levin undergoes in the novel's final chapters, culminating with his discovery of true faith, has its roots in these earlier scenes when the presence of Nicholas provokes a strong intellectual response within him and commands him to address serious themes of death and G-d. Levin concludes his visit with Nicholas by thinking, there is little to be happy about in this world and, he saw death and the approach of death in everything; but the work he had begun interested him all the more, (321) aptly demonstrating that through just one brief visit, Nicholas has induced him to reformulate his entire perspective on life, death, and work. Nicholas has such distinct influence on Levin that his very existence can profoundly alter the very way in which his brother views the world. In a sense Nicholas also serves as an intellectual muse for Levin, a source of inspiration to which he can turn to fuel his ponderings. Because Tolstoy ties Nicholas' character so closely to the specter of death, he implies that by extension, death itself is a muse for Levin. Yet whether the muse takes the specific form of an abstract entity or an earthly being, it propels Levin onward as a man of ideas in Anna Karenina. As he constantly occupies himself with some item of philosophy, Levin owes much of the motivation for these cogitations to Nicholas and everything that he represents. It is not only Levin who reacts strongly to Nicholas, for we see that Kitty's first encounter with Nicholas at the Wells inspired an irrepressible feeling of aversion in her, as she observed his large dreadful eyes, which followed her insistently [and] expressed hatred and irony (197). When she accompanies Levin to Nicholas' deathbed her feelings rapidly change, and she then feels pity for the invalid, experiencing, a need for action, for finding out all the particulars of his condition, and a desire to help him (449). In either case Kitty's response to Nicholas substantiates even further the potent impact that he has on Levin by reinforcing his status as a polarizing and thoroughly penetrating character that leaves a lasting impression on those who cross his path. At the deathbed it is Levin who feels horror and repulsion, choking with sobs and unable to utter a word (450). The reversal of roles and attitudes in this scene carries major significance because it causes Levin to understand that Kitty knew surely what death was&knew without a minute's hesitation how to behave with the dying and did not fear them, while Levin and others like him who were able to say a great deal about death, evidently did not know anything, for they feared it and had no notion what to do when people were dying (450). Levin comes to realize that however virile his mind, however much he might know about death from his readings, and no matter what questions on the subject he might be intellectually able to confront, nonetheless he remains pragmatically helpless, for G-d has hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes (451). Not nearly so bogged down in the mire of heady ideas and existential concerns as her husband, Kitty experiences none of the resulting paralysis that so plagues Levin when the time comes for action. She thus gains a new level of respect and appreciation from Levin as he observes her remarkable ability to tend to Nicholas confidently and sensibly, addressing not only his physical but also his spiritual needs, and he comes to recognize that all she did was well done (452). Levin sees her in a new and favorable light in the days leading up to Nicholas' death, and this evolution in his view of her brings them closer to each other. Originally having rejected Kitty's request to join him at his brother's side, claiming you will be in my way (442) and annoyed that perhaps she loved him too much, Levin now experiences an intense upwelling of emotion after watching Kitty excel at her work for a few days and seeing how quickly his brother was able to find comfort in her presence while he himself was at a loss for what to say and do. He tells Kitty quite genuinely I am very, very glad you came. You are purity itself, (453) and in this moment Levin and Kitty unite to connect on a deeper level, all of which is occasioned, albeit indirectly, by Nicholas. The novel's intricate connections between life and death are on display again here, for by helping him to address the question of death Kitty increases her value in Levin's life. Similarly, it is in his time of death that Nicholas makes his final and most enduring contribution to Levin's life. Furthermore, an assertion of love for Nicholas (because he loved the dying man more than the others did, Levin felt that lie most painfully (456)) precedes Levin's subsequent declaration of love for Kitty, as though Levin needed to affirm to himself his love for his brother and accept the pain of his death as a natural part of life before declaring later in the chapter the potent and inexplicable nature of his love with Kitty. Nicholas' death renews in Levin's soul that feeling of horror at the inscrutability, nearness, and inevitability of death, but these thoughts do not drive him to despair as they have previously, because in spite of death, he felt the necessity of living and loving. He felt that love had saved him from despair, and that that love under the menace of despair grew still stronger and purer (459). Levin loves Kitty even more at the moment of Nicholas' death than he has before, because he realizes that her love possesses a preserving power which has kept him afloat when he was in danger of drowning in his despondency. There is little question that Levin and not Kitty will wind up the novel's hero, but this does not fundamentally devalue the importance of her role in this particular episode. Levin has his wife to thank for sustaining through her presence and support his very capacity to live and to love in the face of death and confusion, and he owes an equal debt of gratitude to Nicholas for providing the very menace of despair that allows his love to grow stronger and purer. Without Nicholas' suffering and death to give a physical form to Levin's moribund intellectual despair, he would have been deprived of the opportunity to forge a closer bond with Kitty. This new sense of togetherness between Kitty and Levin quickly gains a physical manifestation when the doctor confirms Kitty's pregnancy, prompting Levin to muse, scarcely had the unexplained mystery of death been enacted before his eyes when another mystery just as inexplicable presented itself, calling to love and life (459). A life-cycle progression comes full circle, as one life ends only for another to begin -- sickness and death unexpectedly heralding of birth and new life. By placing Nicholas' death and the announcement of Kitty's pregnancy in immediate sequence within just a few lines of each other, Tolstoy suggests that Nicholas may have traded his life for that of Levin's child, thus completing a circle of mystery for Levin and helping to teach him how to love. This direct juxtaposition emphasizes to Levin that he need not fear death and can instead incorporate it organically into his conception of life, as the two are forever connected. The irony inherent in the fact that one of the more spiteful and loveless characters in the novel actually plays a large role in bringing two other characters together and introducing thoughts of love and new life into their minds only enriches Nicholas' unexpected role. In Anna Karenina, Tolstoy molds and develops his secondary characters with dexterity; each one plays a critical role in the book no matter how few pages s(he) may actually traverse. Constantine's invalid sibling Nicholas Levin appears in only a handful of scenes before he vanishes entirely about halfway through the novel, yet because of the ways in which he represents death and the commanding influence he has on his brother, his effect on the book extends far beyond the limits of his physical presence. Functioning, among other roles, as a catalyst for the unification of Levin and Kitty and as a starting (and ending) point for Levin's frequent philosophical and ideological contemplations, Nicholas leaves an indelible stamp on Anna Karenina as he is paradoxically integral to the development of both the book's themes of love, life, and death.

ENG.G0.17.1,The Grey Zone of Shame,English,Argumentative Essay,"The Drowned and the Saved is a very different endeavor compared to Primo Levi's other writings about the Holocaust. Both Survival in Ausweitz and The Reawakening take place in the moment of action  in the Lager  and were written soon after the experience. By contrast, Levi wrote The Drowned and the Saved in the 1970's. With the additional time and some emotional distance, The Drowned and the Saved directly discusses the issues that were depicted in Levi's previous novels. Writes Levi, the novel contains more considerations than memories (Levi 35). Specifically, Levi explains the ambiguousness of morality, guilt, and shame. He calls this the grey zone. The grey zone appears to describe a (fittingly) broad set of actions and ideas. On the surface, the grey zone demonstrates the absence of a clearly demarcated line between good and evil. Levi feels that the desire for simplification (37) is justified for the young, but this concept of true heroes and villains is a literary fantasy that cannot be realized in real life. Levi describes the moral disintegration that struck almost everyone: life in the Lager involved a regression, leading back precisely to primitive behavior (39). As evidence for this transformation, one may examine the treatment of new prisoners by the established veterans. Levi writes, Rarely was a newcomer received& as a companioninmisfortune. Rather, in the majority of cases, those with seniority showed irritation or even hostility& [the newcomer] was envied& derided and subjected to cruel pranks (39). How can one reconcile these actions with the tremendous guilt that follows? Levi argues that the reaction of those in the Lager, while barbaric, was a natural human reaction given the situation. He defends, The prisoners of the Lagers& represented an average, unselected sample of humanity (49). Essentially, Levi makes a statistically based, scientific argument to defend the actions of the prisoners. Since the prisoners of the Lager represented a true crosssection of humanity, it can be extrapolated that any other representative sample would have reacted the same way. Thus, their behavior was rigidly preordained as the vectors and instruments of the system's guilt (49). The grey zone becomes cloudier when one considers the actions of the privileged prisoners. Levi's description of the kapos is drenched with resentment, these prisoners instead of taking you by the hand, reassuring you, teaching you the way, throws himself at you, screaming in a language you do not understand, and strikes you in the face. He wants to& extinguish any spark of dignity that he has lost and you perhaps still preserve (41). Yet, Levi concedes, in general, [the privileged] are poor devils like ourselves (44). Indeed, privileged prisoners were also those responsible for the most daring and successful revolts in the camp. It also should be remembered that Levi himself was a privileged prisoner for working in the chemical kommando. However, the members of the chemical kommando were never charged with harming or controlling other prisoners. But what if they had been? Would Levi have reacted the same way as the Einsatkommandos, who slaughtered Russian civilians under orders (31)? This inability to truly judge one's own actions, this relative morality, is the grey zone. How, then, can one judge the kapos? Levi seems to place the kapos perilously at the edge of the grey zone. Their actions are more deliberate, more conscious  more evil  than the other prisoners. The difference is that once given power they took it upon themselves to seek more and assert it. In doing so, many kapos began to emulate the Nazis, power was sought by the man among the oppressed who had been contaminated by their oppressors and unconsciously strove to identify with them (48). That places many kapos outside of the grey and the realm that the Nazis occupy  that of the truly guilty. From the grey zone, Levi observes two phenomena that emerge: the shame of the victims, and the distortion of the memory of the perpetrators, a falsification of reality, [a] negation of reality& to protect the conscience (31). Though Levi advocates an understanding of this grey zone through relative morality, that does not mean that one should refrain from judgment. For this reason, Levi does not allow the Nazi perpetrator's entry into the grey zone: The majority of the oppressors, during or after their deeds, realized that what they were doing or had done was iniquitous& but its suffering is not enough to enroll them among the victims (59). Indeed, there is a line, that when crossed, is most certainly evil. But one of Levi's most crucial messages in The Drowned and the Saved is that the prisoners (with few exceptions) did not cross this line. Levi stresses with great urgency that the prisoner's errors and weaknesses are not enough to rank them with their custodians. The victims of the Holocaust were human beings placed in an inhuman environment. For their actions, however bad, they should understand and reflect, and perhaps feel some shame, but not guilt. The real crime was the Holocaust in itself. The Michigan Corpus of Upper-level Student Papers (MICUSP) is owned by the Regents of the University of Michigan (UM), who hold the copyright.

ENG.G0.18.1,Individuality and Isolation in Moll Flanders,English,Argumentative Essay,"Moll, in Defoe's Moll Flanders, is a female character who, curiously, seems to lack maternal instinct, who abandons her children time and time again and shies away from ever creating or being a part of a traditional family unit. The traditional female roles of belonging to the private sphere, of maintaining the home and staying out of public affairs is still a standard in the early 18th century. But Moll entirely defies this convention; her wishes are externalized, her personal will made known from the first few pages of the novel. Her methods of obtaining money force her out into the world. She is constantly interacting with others, practicing a sort of employment that, though illegal, resembles a trade. Her thievery gives her a reliable income and puts her into the public sphere. Her externalization is, for the time, characteristically masculine; her livelihood does not consist of raising children, but of making business in the world. This recurring masculinity in the portrayal of Moll's character suggests a woman of a new era; the 1800s become an era in which the first cinders of feminism are kindled. But along with defiance of convention and female masculinity come the consequences: Moll remains, throughout the novel, an incredibly isolated figure. Each interaction she has with other human beings falls almost immediately, in most cases, to economic exchange. By her very external actions defining her character, the idea of family and companionship solely for human interaction and interpersonal connection is barely emphasized. The psychological, her inner life, is suppressed. The lack of any psychological probing by Defoe even isolates Moll, in certain cases, from us as readers. Defoe's Moll represents a changing age, one in which people are not entirely products of their circumstances and family, in which the individual becomes increasingly more valued over the ties of duty and kinship; her isolation is the product of not belonging to any particular group, but to herself. At the outset of the novel, in Moll's youth, we see straight away what emphasis she places on independence and self-possession, very unfeminine characteristics for the time. She wants, as a gentlewoman, to be able to Work for myself, and get enough to keep me without that terrible Bug-bear going to Service, whereas they meant to live Great, Rich, and High& (14). Her notion of being a gentlewoman centers entirely around what she can accomplish through her own actions. She values being able to Work for [her]self above all else; this is the foundation of her aspirations. The definition of gentry that she misses has to do with living Great and High, like how others in the society conceive of gentry. These, in contrast with the very physical nature of earning money and subsisting, are ideals and subjectivities. It is in the perception of others that one is great and high; the second part of belonging to the higher class has to do with social connections and establishment of a name in the higher society. Rather than wanting to belong to a class or to an insular group, Moll wants simply to be the master of herself. In the case of the first family of a gentlewoman who takes her in after the death of her Nurse, she is allowed to live a similar life to the daughters of the house: and as I was always with them, I learn'd as fast as they...yet I learn'd by Imitation and enquiry, all that they learn'd by Instruction and Direction&I learn'd to Dance and speak French as well as any of them& (18). She outlines here the distinction she draws between formal learning, Instruction and Direction, which belongs to the realm of the gentry, and her own sort of learning, by Imitation and enquiry. Thus, she is not completely dependent on anyone for her learning; the mention of enquiry suggests an active curiosity that enables her to learn. Her learning alongside of the daughters of the family is acceptable, but we see later that it becomes problematic. Moll seems, at every turn, to threaten both the gentry and the notion of family. In the case of the family, it is when Moll is a threat to intrude on their family, to threaten the cohesion. The mother addresses Moll after she refutes wanting to marry the son without prior parental consent: for we have all look'd upon you as a kind of Snare to my Son...for we have all a Respect for you still, tho' not so much, as to have it be the Ruin of my Son; but if it be as you say, we have all wrong'd you very much(43). Moll is addressed as a potential Snare and Ruin. But addressing Moll's intentions of not wanting to marry the son, the mother changes her tone, saying that is the family who has wrong'd her. The snare here is in reference to Moll's potential unadvised marriage to their son. The implication is that her lower birth would tarnish his name. Moll is upsetting the family dynamic because, suddenly, she is in a position to make herself a permanent addition to their family. Moll's semblance of belonging to the gentry is so great that they hold a certain respect for her, that eventually she does marry this son, without great consequence. In much the same way, children are presented as inconveniences and disruptions to life and independence. After the death of her first husband, she says: My two children were indeed taken happily off my Hands, by my Husband's Father and Mother, and that by the way was all they got by Mrs. Betty (49). Here, the children as talked about as if they are objects: children could easily be replaced by any other tangible nounshoes, or pillowcases. They are being acted upon, taken; they have no agency and no human characteristics, serving in this sentence as simply things Moll chooses to leave behind. The familial tie that Moll has to them is completely severed at this leaving, because she conceives of them as objects. Later, she says in reference to her Lancashire husband, &tho' I was in no condition to have had him yet, not being so foolish to marry him when I knew my self to be with Child by another Man (127). She also has no sense of maternal tie to this child; the child, instead, is a tangible and visible manifestation of the affair she had with another man. It is because she bears this child that she meets the Midwife and her future governess, who says ...and if you have no Friends to come to you, you may save the Expence of a supper (131). This is where the reader is reminded explicitly of Moll's lack of connection to those around her. It is in her isolation that this child is a burden; this time, there is no family to hand it off to, and no acquaintances to give support during this time. Moll's occupation as a thief necessitates her isolation from society, yet at the same time, her bond with her Mistress seems to be one of the most genuine in the book; her Mistress is the only confidante she has, and the only one to whom she tells the story of her affair. In some of the phrasing used, like I came home to my Governess, we see the contrast between Moll's state here and in the rest of the book; she has, for once, a home to which she returns, not an impermanent lodging or an apartment at which she awaits her lover, but a place of refuge (158). She says, when she leaves to hide out for fear of being apprehended, I had no Recourse, no Friend, no Confident but my old Governess, and I knew no Remedy but to put my Life in her Hands (173). Surprisingly, she speaks of her life, for one of the only times, as under the control of someone else, but the situation is such that she must remain anonymous so as not to be arrested. Her faith in her Governess here is out of desperation, and soon enough, she is back to her occupation and independence. She is even isolated from her fellow thieves: Here again my old Caution stood me in good stead; Namely, that tho' I often robb'd with these People, yet I never let them know who I was, or where I Lodg'd; nor could they ever find out my Lodging&They all knew me by the Name of Moll Flanders (175). Anonymity is the vehicle through which Moll is a success at robbery, and her preservation of her identity keeps her in the business much longer than the rest; she is not a member of the gentry that she robs from, because they must not recognize her, but she also is not a member of the society of thieves. Though the interdependence between Moll and her governess most closely resembles anything close to a family unit, the dissolution of the unit sheds light on the very nature of the relationship: when Moll is charged with the sentence of death, the governess is struck with Horror at the Sense of her own wicked Life (225). Though they do depend on each other, they also share solidarity without safety; they endanger their lives and oppose the law; their sort of familial structure has no allowable place in society. Moll is a stranger to both us and to those around her; the connections she forms with people all eventually dissolve. She always moves on independently, and ultimately, her entire life is gained by her own hand and her own initiative. Even at the end, it is her will and her plan for buying a plantation that brings them back to Virginia, where the traditional family unit is re-established, with the reintroduction of her son. Even so, the end of the novel does not define the rest, and Defoe comments on the necessary isolation and anonymity of a woman in pursuit of her own agency. It is through denying the maternal instinct and not defining herself as belonging to any single society or community that Moll achieves the financial independence that allows her to be the sort of gentlewoman she defines for herself at a young age. In Moll's masculinity and externalization, Defoe creates a story that is at once about an individual struggle and a struggle that sheds light on the growing individualism and subsequent isolation of humanity in a changing society.

ENG.G0.18.2,Frames and Resistance in Pride and Prejudice,English,Argumentative Essay,"In Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, the larger philosophical questions of beauty, truth, and rationality are examined in the context of frames. There exist the frames of the country and of the city, of privilege and of poverty, of men and of women, of family, and, potentially of most thematic importance to the novel, of acting within and without the limits of decorum and the judgment of others. There are limits to everything in this society, limits on who can court whom, limits on the manner in which one either defers or condescends. Lady Catherine acknowledges this existence of spheres based on inherent social limits, addressing Elizabeth: The upstart pretensions of a young woman without family, connections, or fortune&If you were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to quit the sphere, in which you have been brought up(232). Lady Catherine very astutely focuses on the crux of the conflict that Elizabeth, Jane, and all who are not privileged face in the presence of richness and supposed good breeding. There is a certain association between acting inconsistently with one's class and upbringing, and pretense. Lady Catherine lists the very concerns which could potentially isolate the Bennets from the Darcys and Bingleys, of breeding and fortune, and very directly suggests that Elizabeth does not belong; her use of the term quit the sphere suggests that Elizabeth must cross a line, a demarcation which will involve her into an entirely different existence. It is this focus on decorum and acting within one's spheres of existence, in all their myriad forms, which certain of Austen's characters, like Lady Bingley, espouse. But Jane Austen herself seems to suggest a rethinking of rough demarcations, of pushing one's boundaries and frames in as many ways as possible. An inspection of those things and characters she chooses to paint reveals the ideals she is pushing thematically in the novel, of being constrained by one's context and resisting it. Austen is inspired by the ideals of the picturesque, as suggested by a moment of metafiction which happens in the beginning of the novel. As Mrs. Hurst takes Darcy's hand and they walk off together with Miss Bingley, Elizabeth says You are charmingly group'd, and appear to uncommon advantage. The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth. Good bye(36). In this moment, we see the literal illustration of Austen's thematic exploration. The footnote explains this moment as a rule of the picturesque, that groups of three are especially attractive because of their irregularity (36). A basic rule of picturesque, a focus on that which is irregular, a perception of that which is not typically smooth or perfectly beautiful (Gilpin). In the scene in the novel, Austen draws attention to her own acknowledgement of her craft; in addressing the fact the three are picturesque, she also expedites Elizabeth's immediate removal from the scene; yet, when Elizabeth is removed, so the scene ends. In terms of Elizabeth's notion of picturesque, that they are charmingly group'd, there is a simplicity to her meaning, implying a certain beauty or aesthetic appeal. We learn later, at Pemberley, that Elizabeth is very unacquainted with art. Austen, however, well-acquainted with notions of the picturesque, reveals subtly her design as an author; scenes end when Elizabeth is not in them; her choice of focus, like in a picturesque painting, is on the ruggedness, an irregularity of character, which manifests more in Elizabeth than in any other. We begin the novel within the frame of the Bennet household, a household rife with the aspirations and endeavors of a number of women, though encircling and limited by the agency of a single man. The first dialogue comes from Mrs. Bennet, who is entreating Mr. Bennet to call on Mr. Bingley. Upon assuming Mr. Bennet will not do so, she says such things as I am sick of Mr. Bingley, and then hearing his admission of having called upon him, says I was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance (6). The implied sentiment here is that the happiness of the girls is dependent on a familiarity with eligible bachelors in town, and that the task of creating such an acquaintance is entirely within Mr. Bingley's hands. Here, then, is the demarcation: Mrs. Bennet, insisting so vehemently on Mr. Bennet's taking an action, is not able to act directly on her own, because she is not the patriarch of the family. To neglect such an acquaintance would mean a certain disregard for the prospects of his daughters, and when Mrs. Bennet assumes Mr. Bennet has not called, she is resigned to Mr. Bennet's choices. There is a certain aspect to the limitations of the Bennet household that is aptly described in Nina Auerbach's essay: The near-invisibility of Longbourn and the collective life of the Bennets within it is at one with its economic invisibility under an entail which denies a family of women legal existence (330). This invisibility is not only thematically true, but physically and descriptively true. There is a glaring lack of description of the Bennet house itself; it serves as a baseline, a starting point from which all other things lead. Especially compared to other locations, the Bennet house remains elusive physically; because its ownership is so tenuous, because none of the women have any certain claim to it, the invisibility is, as Auerbach suggests, indicative of a disempowerment of the Bennet women. When we see the examples of higher-class, higher-power places, notably Pemberley, the descriptions are vivid and solid, just as is Darcy's solid and incontrovertible presence associated with the manor: &their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with admiration of his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of splendor, and more real elegance, than the furniture of Rosings( 159). The descriptions of the manor are constantly juxtaposed with references to the master; it exists because of his fortune and his taste. There is a consistent presence of Darcy, just in the description of his house; he has a certain dominion, both in the thoughts of Elizabeth, and over the manor. The descriptions are such of isolation, because Elizabeth has denied him, and is grappling at his presence through his material belongings. Austen's choice of painting Pemberley, but not Longbourn, is a conscious one, reflecting their frames of existence: where Darcy's Pemberley itself casts a dominion over the surroundings, Longbourn is invisible materially and economically, the Bennets quite unsure of its remaining theirs. The sphere of family relations and connections, as Lady Catherine puts it, are most apparent in Darcy's case. His connections to Mr. Bingley bring connections to Miss Bingley, who hopes to seduce him; his tie to his sister creates a family dynamic that functions outside the typical two-parent and children assumption; his ties to Wickham stem from his father's legacy; his ties to Lady Catherine open him to a potential prospect for her daughter; and his ties to Elizabeth Bennet must invariably lead to his ties to her family. If we imagine Darcy with this web of connections, it is apparent that he must tread very carefully to avoid severing any ties. But in both Elizabeth and Darcy's cases, there are certain conventions that must be overturned in order for their love to exist. Darcy overcomes his breeding, and the strict conventions of his class by condescending to Elizabeth, and helping her family. As we see in his first scene, Mr. Darcy danced only once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of evening in walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party (8). Darcy's enclosure within a certain circle of acquaintances and of class is readily apparent in his refusing to dance or speak with anyone outside his immediate acquaintances; in doing so, he denies the social possibilities inherent in a party, choosing instead to stay rigidly confined within the frame he is accustomed to. However, during the accidental meeting at Pemberley, when he is introduced to Elizabeth's aunt and uncle, he expresses a much different perspective on mingling with those outside his class: That he was surprised by the connexion was evident; he sustained it however with fortitude, and so far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into conversation with Mr. Gardiner (165). The conversation, the beginning of a dialogue is exactly that which drives the novel; in conversing with Mr. Gardiner, Darcy is expressing an acceptance of Elizabeth's family as equals. A conversation implies that the two sides are equally engaged, and it is this equality of speaking which signals many turning points in the novel. This passage signals Darcy's breaking free of the rigid assumptions which bound him. Elizabeth's communication with Darcy when he first suggests marriage is what reveals to him all her notions of him that he had not before known. The extent of the conversation is what drives the plot; the subsequent letter from Darcy another extensive attempt at communication. Conversation breaks the barriers which have thus far disenabled them from behaving freely towards each other. And conversation seems to stem freely from them once they receive the approbation of the family. In the end, we return to the idea of frames, this time illustrated by houses and their locations. Austen details where each couple lives and their relations to each other, and in doing so, establishes that these new frames are malleable and transcend the notions of class and fortune which guided the beginning of the novel. In terms of Lady Catherine, her resentment gave way&and she condescended to wait on them at Pemberley& (254). So does Lady Catherine become integrated into a new order of social spheres which does not operate on exclusion. Austen, in her attention to certain aesthetic and visual descriptions, reveals her tendency for complication, for malleable and changing characters which push their boundaries and frames. Though Darcy and Elizabeth both begin in spheres which are uncompromisable and very limiting in their individual ways, Elizabeth manages to break away from the invisibility of Longbourn and Darcy manages to rework Pemberley as a place of socialization and integration, rather than the isolation which was present in its initial description.

ENG.G0.18.3,Satire and Morality in the Vicar of Wakefield,English,Argumentative Essay,"Satire and Morality in The Vicar of Wakefield The Vicar of Wakefield, by Oliver Goldsmith, can be read as a satire because of the exaggerated portrayal of innocence and gullibility, particularly in the case of Dr. Primrose. The decisions the family makes and the situations they experience are ridiculous, not only for the reader, but for other characters in the story as well. However, The Vicar of Wakefield has a very different end than the typical literary satire. Rather than denouncing vice and folly through sinful characters, Goldsmith draws attention to the foolish acts of morally upright characters, suggesting that well-intentioned, religiously-guided behavior does not always result in a positive end. It is the more multi-faceted characters, those who are deceptive and shift roles both in the eyes of the reader and the family, who are in control of themselves and the destiny of the family. The eventual balance of reward for righteous behavior is not achieved by the Primroses themselves, but by other characters, specifically William Thornhill, who transcends notions of class and propriety, appearing in the story both as a villain and hero. When confronted with the deception and evil inherent in the world, the Primroses, guided and represented by the narrator, must be rescued time and time again. The story challenges the narrator's limited perception of the world, placing more importance on the mutability of character, chance and trickery to effect consequences in life, rather than to Primrose's much simpler, more ineffective notion of virtue that goes rewarded. Dr. Primrose is a character both incredibly sentimental, showing emotion which oftentimes prevents him from acting in dire situations, and guided by very rigid principles. This dichotomy of reason and emotion creates tension between his actions and thoughts. He sets down laws, but cannot maintain his authority as master of the family. He elaborates for pages on end about the need for reform in laws and power, but we never see evidence in his character that suggests he can accomplish these reforms. He is a man of thoughts ideals that do not reflect in his actions. For example, he describes their first churchgoing day in the new town: When Sunday came, it was indeed a day of finery, which all my sumptuary edicts could not restrain. How well so ever I fancied my lectures against pride had conquered the vanity of my daughters; yet I still found them secretly attached to all their former finery& (23). My sumptuary edicts suggests that he has created laws to which he expects his family to adhere. His preoccupation with dress as a marker of class and worth is indicted here and throughout the novel. He creates legislation, but as demonstrated in this quote, his daughters remain secretly attached to all their former finery; they internalize their own wishes and vanity, but not admonitions, which more times than not fall useless. In another example, their landlord visits and asks for a song. Primrose narrates: As I did not approve of such disproportioned acquaintances, I winked out my daughters in order to prevent their compliance, but my hint was counteracted by one from their mother; so that with a cheerful air they gave us a favorite song& (25). Here, Primrose's action is counteracted by one from the mother, and the daughters end up ignoring his wishes and heeding their mother's. The use of the word counteract suggests that his effort is completely neutralized by the mother's, so that the woman's will supercedes the man's. This holds true to the sentimental form, and demonstrates how completely Primrose's edicts fail in practice. Also speaking to the simplicity and ineffectiveness of the narrator is his obstinate adherence to class rules. He does not waver from his beliefs, which do not allow him to notice deeper than the superficial qualities of those around him. The examples of his efforts at creating laws for his family also relate to issues of class. He mentions disproportioned acquaintances, meaning that Thornhill was too wealthy to be prudently associated with his much poorer family (25). Later, he describes how his daughters touch Mr. Thornhill: All my endeavours could scarce keep their dirty fingers from handling and tarnishing the lace on his cloaths, and lifting up the flaps of his pocket holes, to see what was there (26). The image is striking because of the way he describes his own family: dirty fingers which tarnish the clothes suggests a soiling, his family somehow denigrating Mr. Thornhill simply by touching him. His tone is detached, as if he is describing beggars on the street, people fouled, though we know from earlier descriptions that these women were earlier dressing above their class, polished and clean. As with the early sumptuary concerns, Primrose is painfully aware of his own class and the propriety of it; he is so much preoccupied with this that he remains a spectator: his family's touching and handling, their investigation of Thornhill's pockets is a symbolic curiosity, a search for secrets that are hidden, whereas Primrose can only see the surface, nothing past the class of the person and his own sense of imprudence. William Thornhill, in the guise of Burchell, says of himself He was surrounded by crowds, who shewed him only one side of their character; so that he began to lose a regard for private interest in universal sympathy. He loved all mankind; for fortune prevented him from knowing there were rascals (19). It is inferred that he changes greatly after this, because he must regain his fortune after having been too trusting. The way in which he describes his former self is very similar to Primrose's own predicament, especially in the case in which both he and Moses are hoodwinked by the same man, who takes both their horses. Being shown only side of their character alludes to the difference between William Thornhill and the narrator: Thornhill, once similar to Primrose, has since learned to embrace the multiple sides of his own personality, to seek out the reality of people and not judge by appearances alone. Primrose still cannot do this, as indicated by his interactions with different classes, of his judgment of his own family, and his misfortunes with money due to his snap judgments of others. It is William who generally fixes all that has gone awry in the Primroses' life. He is the one who has the power to pass judgment in the end. He says, upon revealing his true identity to the family I am now come to see justice done a worthy man, for whom I have the most sincere esteem (152). It is William who must bring justice; Primrose's own actions do not promise a good end. His unveiling heralds a turn of events. Curiously, the eventual restoration of the family comes from a series of almost arbitrary events. Jenkinson happens to recognize the description of Sophia's kidnapper, also later admitting he had married Olivia and Thornhill, saying Perhaps you'll think it was generosity that made me do all this. But no. To my shame I confess it, my only design was to keep the licence and let the Squire know that I could prove it upon him whenever I thought proper, and so make him come whenever I wanted money (164). This is followed by immediate pleasure, but the juxtaposition with the very selfish, unvirtuous story means that they have accepted the good news, despite the means to an end. The ending rests not completely resolved, because though William Thornhill is established as a redeeming figure, bringing Sophia back and resolving the marriages of each of the family members, people like his nephew Thornhill have not redeemed their actions earlier in the story. The nephew says I see no hardship or injustice in pursuing the most legal means of redress (155). This theme continues from the beginning of the story, in which Primrose establishes his efforts at legal power over his own household. The difference here, however, is that the nephew Thornhill has the means to pursue prosecution and real consequences of legal precedents. To this end, the practice wins out over Primrose's idea of legality, which remains mostly theoretical, never practical. A sort of trial ensues, witnesses like the butler brought into testify. The narrator, upon hearing that the nephew Thornhill is already married, says For when we reflect upon the various schemes this gentleman has laid to seduce innocence, perhaps someone more artful than the rest has been found able to deceive him (163). Thornhill's final punishment, having not been able to trick Wilmot from her fortune, rests entirely on another man's greater trickery. This neither aligns with Primrose's idea of virtuous action securing heaven, nor does it undo Thornhill's initial sabotage, abduction and trickery. The outcome, in which Olivia is thus restored to reputation, to friends and fortune at once, was a rapture sufficient to stop the progress of decay and restore former health and vivacity (164). Reputation here is not a reputation based on moral goodness, but on fortune, the cause of all the class distinction that Primrose so adamantly lectures against, instead seeking modesty and class propriety for his daughters. This restoration to fortune, hinging on a marriage with a trickster and an exploitative cheat, is not altogether ideal. Thornhill is found criminal through the trial, yet because Jenkinson out-tricks him by having already married him, the family is happy. There is no complete sense of redemption or resolution here, because it is not virtue that is rewarded, but deceit. The consequences and final judgments in The Vicar of Wakefield are rendered by those characters who express the greatest mutability, who have been deceptive, have worn guises and used trickery to achieve their ends. The most morally grounded character, with the most faith in doctrine and idealism, is Primrose, yet the family is punished time and time again for the foolish behavior which stems from his simple way of looking at the world. The end of the story, though seemingly establishing a virtuous family rewarded, places great emphasis on fortune and on deceit to achieve an end. Primrose, guided by morality and principles of class propriety, is the least ineffectual when trying to effect change; as the leader of his family, he remains generally ineffective until William Thornhill saves them. Goldsmith overturns the conventions of satire, exposing vice and folly, but moreso exposing and questioning innocence and the kind of morality that has no place in the world.

ENG.G0.18.4,The Space of Dreams in The Age of Innocence,English,Argumentative Essay,"In Edith Warton's The Age of Innocence, dreams of self-fulfillment lie in contrast to the context in which the characters existthe time, the place, the society. This context is eminently important to the denouement of the plot and is deterministic of the fate of these characters. Throughout the novel, the narrator is a voice from the future, so that the portrayal Old New York does not just exist insularly, but in reference to a potential, to impending and sometimes unthinkable change. For this reason, the last chapter is crucial to our understanding of unrequited dreams. In her portrayal of fate, Wharton suggests that the dreams of Newland and Ellen can only continue to be dreams within the context and time of their New York social circle, but for the next generation, the romance of Newland and Ellen would have had no restraints in a new world order. The world of the last chapter, particularly Paris is, in a way, the potential space of the dream of Newland and Ellen's love, but there is a sense that passing time and a life already lived makes this era the domain of the new generation. Newland and Ellen's romance is shaped by their dreams, by the fantasy of their future together. When asked if he wants Ellen for a mistress, Newland responds I wantI want somehow to get away with you into a world where words like thatcategories like thatwon't exist. Where we will be simply two human beings who love each other&and nothing else on Earth will matter (238). He wants a space devoid of context, not only without expectations and conventions to follow, but entirely without categories to qualify love. The idea that nothing else on Earth will matter is an ideal, a space in which the two of them can be the sole inhabitants, an idea of Eden or a personal utopia. They find this space separate from anything else on Earth for mere moments during the story: in her house the first time he visits, in the house of the old Patroon, on the boat in Boston, in the carriage coming back to New York. But the moments are fleeting, and, when they end, they still have no action or plan to assure a life together. It is a rare occurrence that they find each other in these solitary moments, and the possibility of such a rapport outside of these spaces does not exist. Similarly, the promises made during these interactions do not endure; on the boat, Ellen promises that I won't go back, a promise we want to believe (201). But, it becomes shattered when taken outside of the realm of their space apart; such a promise cannot exist when there are such duties to others, when there is a society in which they must fit themselves. When Archer goes in his wife's chariot to bring Ellen back to New York, he envisions a dream of her: he pictured Madame Olenska's descent from the train, his discovery of her a long way off, among the throngs of meaningless faces&her clinging to his arm as he guided her to the carriage&in the motionless carriage, while the earth seemed to glide away under them, rolling to the other side of the sun. It was incredible, the number of things he had to say to her& (234). The dream is detailed, with a series of seemingly ordinary images, but then the language tips into the realm of fantasy, in which even the movement of the earth bypasses them, seem[s] to glide away, and the carriage remains motionless. His dream is, essentially, a wish for a halt in time, in which a carriage is simply a space in which they can converse, not a vehicle in which society must always be heading somewhere. In his dream, the earth and sun are no longer relevant in their time-keeping. But even as he says after he sees her in reality that it all happened as he had dreamed, the dream must always end (235). In this case, it ends when Archer asks Ellen Then what, exactly, is your plan for us? and she replies For us? But there is no us in that sense! We're near each other if we stay far away from each other. Then we can be ourselves (239). This suggests that these moments of intimacy in which they are honest in their love cannot persist if they are two people in the world together; the microcosm of an ideal that they create in these small spaces, like in the carriage, exist within themselves. This microcosm cannot be externalized. The carriage stops to let him off, but continues moving; Archer does not stand but begins walking home. Real life and the inevitable progress of time continues; his walk home is a return to a familiar context. In the final chapter, the flower of life that Archer misses is, in one way, this same dream, one which could not grow in the stifling environment of his youth, before he has a child (286). Fanny Beaufort is portrayed as a likeness of Countess Olenska, but at once not Countess Olenska, because she has not felt the sting of being ostracized or having to re-imagine herself for the sake of others. New York society instead of being distrustful and afraid of her, took her joyfully for granted...Nobody was narrow-minded enough to rake up against the half-forgotten facts of her father's past and her own origin (290). The conventions that once dictated and bound Archer to a life of dutythe importance of keeping up a fa�ade in having a clean record and a good family, the absolute crash of the social structure around Archer when Beaufort was found to have defaulted on his finances, the ostracism of him and his apologetic wifeare forgotten by this new society. Fanny Beaufort is the descendant of these same Beauforts, yet it would be hard to tell simply by her interaction with the world. She seems completely separated from the Beauforts of the rest of the novel; if she is Countess Olenska, she is a perpetually happy one, accepted joyfully, taken for her accomplishments. Wharton stresses the parallel of Fanny and Dallas' love and that of Newland and Ellen's, but there is such little conflict between the personal and the social in Fanny and Dallas' engagement that this resembles the dream-world Newland once longed for, the one in which they are simply two human beings who love each other. Wharton urges the reader to consider this prospect by saying There was nothing now to keep [Ellen] and Archer apartand that afternoon he was to see her (294). Nothing keeps them apart in terms of spousal obligation, but, yet, something does end up keeping them apart. Archer's conception of Ellen in this last chapter is like a dream: When he thought of Ellen Olenska it was abstractly, serenely, as one might think of some imaginary beloved in a book or a picture: she had become the composite vision of all that he had missed (286). Ellen was an ideal and an escape in his youth; she is, in his old age, a symbol of all his regret for not having been able to pursue his own passions. Whereas she was a real, tangible lover in his youth as well as a dream, she exists now, after so long, only as a dream. In the closing scene of Archer on the doorstep, he says to his son Say I'm old-fashioned: that's enough (297). It is long past the time when he can pursue dreams; he is old-fashioned, the entirety of his life defined by a time long past. On the doorstep, his notion of her is, again, a dream: Then he tried to see the persons already in the roomfor probably at that sociable hour there would be more than oneand among them a dark lady, pale and dark, who would look up quickly& (298). He has internalized her, and even the very vivid daydream is not the neutral space he once wished for; they cannot be alone in the dream, for there would be more than one. There is no person left who will keep them apart, but his fantasy has been so long internalized, his entire life lived without the flower of life. His inaction is at once a retreat into dreams, and a realization that he cannot externalize the dream; the only course for a man who has seen his life pass by him without passion is, as it was when he got out of the carriage, to walk home, to proceed with the tide of time. We understand the impossibility of Ellen and Archer's love from the fleeting moments in which they are alone; each time they must return, the promises and hopes they have of one another no longer apply in the greater society and time. And so, their dreams are internalized and never expressed in the context of the greater society. The end of the novel describes a more progressive, more open time, rife not only with the potential of politics and technology, but with the potential of the individual; Dallas and Fanny's unsurprising engagement is what Ellen and Archer's might have been, had they both been born into this era. But Dallas and Fanny are not Ellen and Archer; they were not brought up in the 19th century. What marks Archer as an outsider to this modern society is his inability, ultimately, to pursue the individual, self-fulfilling life, in which Ellen is a central figure. Archer is irrevocably bound to what has come before; he has lived the majority of his life denying his dreams, and, ultimately, the dreams are more real to him than his pursuit of them. The potential space of their consummated romance is defined by their experience, their ties back to a context in which they could not live happily; although the society has changed, Archer's life is bound by the commitment he once made and cannot unmake.

ENG.G0.19.2,Paper on Invisible Man for an American Lit course,English,Argumentative Essay,"Existentialist philosophy asserts that we live in a broken world (Marcel). An ambiguous world (de Beauvoir). A dislocated world (Merleau-Ponty). A world of indifference. Of absurdity (Camus). One we are thrown into and abandoned in, yet condemned and free (Heidegger and Sartre). It is this philosophy that detonates what superficially appears to be the doctrine of a dark and dismal lifestyle, yet it is quite the opposite. It is a philosophy of freedom, of choice, of letting go of that which is unimportant and accepting a world characterized by irrationality and indifference. Grounded in the freedom of self-invention and power of choice, one is not bound to the simplifications and theoretical definitions of others have determined what being human predicates, but the assertion that individual man defines his own reality and existence. Often times in literature, an existentialist figure will find himself separated from the world and other people. As a result of feeling isolated or alone, he feels threatened, meaningless, insignificant, but learns to embrace the unresolvable confusion of the human world and resist the all-too-human desire to resolve that confusion by extending himself to whatever appears or can be made to appear safe or familiar. Published in 1952 by Ralph Ellison, the disoriented protagonist of Invisible Man fits this description by facing a confusing world in which he cannot fit into. Wherever Ellison's unnamed Negro character travels in the novel, he is weakened and left rootless by people who did either entirely disregard his inner character or envisage and use him as a symbol. In the 581-page novel, the narrator spends much of it shifting his personality like the colors on that of a chameleon, as each time he throws off that mask, he finds himself trapped inside another stereotype or disguise. In Ellison's existential bildungsroman, it is only until he realizes the absurdity and irrationality of the world that he is able to free himself of the building expectations of the roles he feels he is supposed to play. A close reading of the opening passage and concluding passages demonstrates the existential ontogenesis of Ellison's protagonist as it exhibits his movement from rural innocence to cosmopolitan maturity and disillusionment. With the discovery of one word, he finds himself free, free of the expectations and roles and he creates his own reality, and finally able to establish his identity as the man he wants to be. Following a wild and disorienting prologue, the narrator begins in the first paragraph with self reflection. He comments, All my life I had been looking for something, and everywhere I turned someone tried to tell me what it was&I was looking for myself and asking everyone except myself questions which I, and only I, could answer (15). Acting as frame for the novel, this narrative gives readers the context for the story of an existential bildungsroman. Occurring later in the first chapter, the narrator attends a gathering to give his celebrated graduation speech to the significant white men of the community. Expecting a proper, polite, and respectable gathering, the narrator finds the scene of to be the exact opposite. He finds himself hurled into a group of other Negro boys, forced watch a beautiful, stark naked woman dance, and then fight in a humiliating battle royal. Serving no purpose other than vulgar entertainment for the prominent white men of the town, the battle royal exists as another occasion in the novel where white men take advantage of the narrator's passivity and idealistic nature. In addition to heightening the tension between submission and rebellion, the battle royal can be seen as a contrast of the narrator's personality, between his youth and later developed self. Later in the novel at the occurrence of his existential revelation, he has a specific understanding and diction to describe the procession of chaotic ongoing events surrounding him. But, during the battle royal, he endures the same injustice, the same randomness, the same irrationality and problems of agency, yet he equivocally describes it. He claims he had some misgivings over the battle royal (17), feels guilt and fear (19) and blind terror (21). Despite the loss of his dignity (I had no dignity (22) in the mad (20) anarchy (21) of the situation, the narrator continues to fight automatically (24). He obediently follows and does not question his orders. There was nothing to do but what we were told, he claims (21). A fundamental cornerstone in existentialism is the belief in a choice  there is always a choice. With the narrator indicating he had none, Ellison highlights his immaturity and inability to command his own life as lives in the shadows of others. In stark contrast of his thoughts and self at the end of the novel, Ellison willfully places this scene as the opening chapter. The absolute absurdity and irrationality of this commencing incident is no mistake. Ellison purposely introduces his narrator in a light of inferiority and literal and metaphorical blindness to show the development of his protagonist into a confident existentialist figure. Ellison extends his na�vet� through the symbol of the blindfold. The blindfold parallels the narrator's metaphorical blindness in that he cannot see through the mendacious masks of the white men's benevolence. Like the blindfold, the speech he gives also plays with another theme of the book. His memorized oratory parallels the narrator playing the game as he participates in a sort of performance, a masquerade of acting and playing the part of a humble Negro boy. Contributing to the narrator's metaphorical blindness and performance, the sequence of the battle royal contributes to the narrator's initial steps in becoming the man he chooses to become. Fast forwarding to chapter 23, the narrator realizes his role in the Brotherhood. Furious to finally understand his function was nothing more than to act as a puppet for a corrupt organization, the narrator begins a deep process of self reflection. He comments, And now all past humiliations became precious parts of my experience, and for the first time&I began to accept my past&I saw that [images of past humiliations] were more than separate experiences. They were me; they defined me. I was my experiences and my experiences were me(507-8). This passage marks the narrator's commencing conscious process of self-invention as he begins to flirt with existential philosophy in his building of his identity. It is further developed in chapter 25 while under attack by Ras's mob. This is the most crucial moment of the narrator's existential bildungsroman and it begins with Ras threatening his life. 'Hang the lying traitor,' Ras shouted (558). It is at this moment in which the narrator, faced with the very likely prospect of death, begins to see through the eyes of an existentialist. &It seemed unreal. I faced them knowing that a madman in a foreign costume was real and yet unreal, knowing that he wanted my life, that he held me responsible for all the nights and days and all the suffering and for all that which I was incapable of controlling (558). The playing with the words real and unreal plays with the idea of absurdity, of death and existence being absurd, and the world existing as a meaningless scope of irrationality in which he begins to realize his place. In the next paragraph, he repeats the word absurd four times, each time recapitulating the power and force behind that word. He now has a word, a language, to describe the night, Ras's existence, his existence, and the deceptive American masquerading for identity. Unlike his description of the battle royal in which he not once used the word absurd to describe the utterly insane chaos around him  the word absurd means something to now him: it offers him a new direction new and possibilities in life. The repetition of the word absurd furthermore alludes to a fundamental key in existentialism. Ellison crafts his interpretation of the absurd to refer to the objectivity, indifference, and ambiguity the narrator experiences in the world, and simultaneously the possibility of the narrator creating meaning through his actions and interpretations. His new discovery of the absurd contributes to the narrator's realization for the first time that he has control over his life and the power of choice. [I] recognized the absurdity of the whole night&and I knew that it was better to live out one's own absurdity than to die for that of others, whether for Ras's or Jack's. His existential breakthrough creates the narrator's source of meaning to his life as the narrator's identity. He later comments in the epilogue that my problem was that I always tried to go in everyone's way but my own (573), and following and attempting to fulfill the expectations of others, he found it destructive to his identity and his creation of meaning of his life. The consequent action of throwing the spear back at Ras demonstrates the narrator's commitment to his own identity and his permanent refusal to be subject to others peoples' visions and demands any longer. With this notion, he finally devotes himself totally to an effort to assert his true identity. The next chapter finds the narrator's story has come full circle, as it both begins and ends with his underground life. Though some critics see his choice to live underground as a cop-out or evasion from his problems, in reading his choice through the philosophy of existentialism, readers find that the importance lies in neither asking if he is evading or snubbing society, but that he has made a choice. Instead of trying to follow the myriad of advice and guidance recommended to him throughout the text, the narrator takes matters into own hands and decides to stay underground to ponder his existence and the meaning he wants his life to have. In his cave, he points out, he does not have the interference of others, and he is open to thinking for himself. At the end of the novel, the narrator affirms his uncertainty in regards to a concrete identity, but determines to venerate his own complexity and duty to society as an individual. In reflecting back to his language and personality in the initial chapter of battle royal then comparing that to the closing episode with Ras, readers witness his movement from rural innocence to maturity and disillusionment in this existential bildungsroman, in which a lone protagonist discovers himself and frees himself of the expectations and roles created by society. Life is to be lived, not controlled, he claims, and humanity is won by continuing to play in the face of defeat (577).

ENG.G0.20.1,Autonomy in Robinson Crusoe,English,Argumentative Essay,"In Western society (specifically in the United States) there has existed an idea since the colonial days that any individual, despite their class in the motherland, can achieve wealth and prosperity through hard work and determination alone. This idea has been commonly referred to throughout history as the myth of autonomy, because so many have tried it and failed. While not originally created as a myth, it was an idea that could give those trying to escape either religious persecution, monarchy rule, or an unfortunate lot in class structure a chance to become independently wealthy and part of an upper class where no upper class as of yet existed (the British colonies). However, this idea became a myth when it was realized that as long as there was a ruling body governing from a distance (England) and making all the rules to live by-from common law to business taxation-there was no chance to become independently wealthy unless birth had already dictated it. Thus, the myth of autonomy was born. Surprisingly, after the Revolution, the myth of autonomy was revived and in fact became somewhat possible for even those of the lowest class. In Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe, this myth of autonomy is alive and well. Crusoe is able to break away from his station in England and achieve independent prosperity on his island for twenty-eight years (as well as his later wealth due to his plantations in Brazil). Interestingly, he is only able to achieve this autonomy once the rule of the monarchy is completely lost from his life. There arises, however, a conflict between this autonomy and Crusoe's faith that God has intervened many times to save his life since he first washed up on the island. By examining this conflict in terms of certain aspects of autonomy and faith (such as pride versus humility and self-reliance versus gratitude), there is a much larger connection between capitalism and asceticism that arises. Looking at both of these, a greater understanding can be attained as to just how the conflict and the connection contributed to the myth of autonomy in the novel and in the people of the day. Pride and humility are two emotions that have been at odds since the beginning of mankind; as it is said, pride cometh before the fall. It is therefore preached by many (both religious and secular individuals) that humility is required to have lasting success. But, when one achieves something great, it is only natural and acceptable to take pride in it. This is quite common in Robinson Crusoe, as Crusoe takes nothing but pride in achieving a stable life on his island through his own devices alone. He expresses this best as he lists all of the tribulations he went through to build his original shelter: Into this Fence or Fortress, with infinite Labour, I carry'd all my Riches, all my Provisions&I made me a large Tent, which, to preserve me from the Rains&And now I lay no more for a while in the Bed which I had brought on Shore, but in a Hammock&and having thus enclos'd all my Goods, I made up the Entrance, which till now I had left open, and so pass'd and repass'd, as I said by a short ladder, (Defoe, 45). Humility is lost, especially when Crusoe starts declaring himself King and Lord of the island, and the fall of pride never arrives. This greatly adds to the myth of autonomy, as Crusoe achieves great things and prosperity-and knows it-yet there are no negative consequences to this. He becomes a lord, gains great wealth, and is even rescued (albeit a bit late, but it still happens). Everything goes his way with no need for humility. In a time when very few were actually successful in achieving this type of wealth, the tale of Robinson Crusoe would have acted as a catalyst for more individuals to at least try to attain the dream. Another well-known and often debated conflict between autonomy and faith is that between self-reliance and gratitude. This conflict, on a more religious level, is basically the age old debate over whether or not there is a God and if there is, what power He holds of an individual's life. Crusoe brings this debate to the forefront: he praises God for his salvation on the island, for bringing him the ship that leads to his rescue, for many of the things that happen in his everyday life after he has sufficiently set himself up on the island, such as when he washed back up on shore after sailing around the island to reach his house: When I was on Shore I fell on my Knees and gave God Thanks for my Deliverance, (103). Yet, when it came down to it, he relied solely on his own devices to survive and builds his successful new life. God doesn't give him anything, he does it all on his own. So, Crusoe's situation provides support to the idea that perhaps God has no power over the things that occur in the lives of men. Self-reliance is really the only way to achieve anything. When it is broken down as such, the conflict all but states that the myth of autonomy is not only plausible but possible. Autonomy comes first and foremost from being able to achieve wealth without help from anyone or anything. It is attained by one's hard work and by knowing that the only person who can help in achieving success is one's self. To know that it was possible for Robinson Crusoe to get so much by relying only on himself and pushing gratitude off to the side (and calling on it only when he felt it was absolutely necessary, or when he felt he needed to go through the motions of having retained faith on his island) would have spurred the myth of autonomy forward. This Day I went to Work with it accordingly, and got two Shores or Posts pitch'd upright to the Top, with two Pieces of Boards a-cross over each Post&and setting up more Posts up with Boards, in about a week more I had the Roof secur'd and the Posts standing in Rows, serv'd me for Partitions to part of my House, (55). Here, Crusoe applies carpentry skills he may not have realized he had to secure his house after a cave in. Even though it was a novel, anyone could have recognized that if a fictional character could have achieved so much on an island, imagine what someone could do in a major city in a new land with all the devices of society at their disposal. Looking at how faith and autonomy have clashed in the novel (with autonomy coming out as the clear winner), a much broader connection has been revealed between the accumulation of wealth and the work ethic of an individual. This is the [once] commonly held idea that capitalism cannot exist without asceticism. While this has changed somewhat throughout history (with capitalism finding its old roots once again in generational wealth among families), for the most part, it remains the connection. Crusoe is able to achieve a capitalistic society purely by ascetic means. It is his hard work alone that gives him this unimaginable wealth in a place where money has no value and the only other people are cannibals. However, this connection itself is what originally created the myth of autonomy, and when the connection is applied to Western society in the strictly basic form that it is presented in the novel, a few problems arise that again show why autonomy became a myth in the first place. Capitalism is easy for Crusoe to achieve because he is the only individual in his society. He is Lord and laborer; he commands all and receives all wealth. This is fine for a one-man show, but in Western society things do not work so basically. Karl Marx even tried to apply what Crusoe accomplished to Western society: Let us now picture to ourselves&a community of free individuals&in which the labour-power of all the different individuals is consciously applied as the combined labour-power of the community. All the characteristics of Robinson's labour are here repeated, but with this difference, that they are social, instead of individual, (Marx, 90). Capitalism relies heavily on the interactions one has with other people. The constant trading of goods and the buying and selling of services is what drives capitalism. Without both of these processes in a multiple person society, capitalism cannot exist, and if capitalism cannot exist then asceticism amounts to absolutely nothing. As Ian Watt said, He owns freehold, an estate which is rich, though unimproved&the shipwreck, which is supposed to be a retributive disaster, is in fact a miraculous gift&and one rendered particularly felicitous by the death of all the other passengers, (Watt, 107). Someone can work as hard as is humanly possible, but without the interaction with others, nothing will be gained. This application is what ultimately breaks the idea of autonomy and turns it into a myth. If there has to be trade with others, then self-reliance is gone, and with it often goes the pride of men. Therefore, while there is indeed a strong connection between capitalism and asceticism, the idea of how these two connect has to be adjusted if autonomy of any kind is going to exist in multi-person societies. So, the myth of autonomy, while very tempting to many since the European powers began their colonization, is no more than that: a myth. Even with hard work and self-reliance, for capitalism to take off, there has to be trade with other people. While Robinson Crusoe may have been able to achieve autonomy, this comes more from his single person society than from autonomy actually being possible. The only time that autonomy was somewhat possible was just after the Revolutionary War, when the United States started its westward expansion. With the discovery of new land, new resources, and new means of transportation, some individuals were able to achieve great wealth through their efforts. But, in the end, the wealth had to come from somewhere else, since resources in their own right have no real value (save gold). So, even when things had not been discovered, those who did come across them still had to get their wealth through commerce with others. All of this shows that while autonomy and faith may be at odds, there is really no strict autonomy, and in order to achieve wealth, faith has to be pushed to the side. In the end, neither idea wins.

ENG.G0.21.1,Elevated Language in Beowulf,English,Argumentative Essay,"The epic classic Beowulf is weak with respect to many typical epic conventions such as starting in medias res, invocating the muse, and utilizing epic similes. In spite of this, the narrative is rich with the epic attribute of elevated language (Online Literary Handbook) in its descriptions of characters. This technique greatly augments the heroic qualities of Beowulf the character while illustrating the contemptible infamy of his foe, Grendel. The inflated prose illuminates the strong foil between the two with physical descriptions and accounts that set Beowulf and Grendel apart from others. The embellished diction in Beowulf serves as a cue to the reader about the nature of the characters. Without it, the reader would certainly still interpret good characters as good and bad characters as evil; but with it, the reader sees to what extent they are this way. This is made especially clear with the characters Beowulf and Grendel. It is important that this is so since Beowulf is more than just a good character; he's a hero; and Grendel is more than just antagonistic; he's a dreadful villain. Beowulf's character is elevated from the moment the reader sees him  literally. Before he proves his valor and accomplishes great feats, the author describes what a spectacular sight he is to see. The watchman at Heorot, upon first glance at Beowulf, states, Nor have I seen/ a mightier man-at-arms on this earth/ than the one standing here: unless I am mistaken, / he is truly noble (l. 247-50). This passage speaks a lot to the physical presence that Beowulf brings. He and his men have not yet spoken a word about who they are nor what their purpose is and, without reservation, the watchman not only identifies Beowulf as the leader of the group, but is also convinced of his strength and ability as a warrior. Later, when he reports to Hrothgar about the men, he describes Beowulf as formidable indeed (l. 370). Extravagant language like this used to depict Beowulf's appearance shows that his peers revere him. It is likely the intent of the author that readers feel the same way about him. Simply put, he has it, and everyone can see it. The reader doesn't get much information about the physical appearance of Grendel, but it can be inferred that he appears mostly contrary to that of Beowulf. The poem depicts Grendel as a spectacle of size and strength. He is strong enough to take hold of 30 men at once (l. 122), and his head is large enough that it took four soldiers to carry it once removed (l. 1637-8). Still, these are just indications of his size. The author uses more emphatic language to depict his demeanor from his physicality. In the first line about Grendel, he is introduced as a powerful demon, a prowler through the dark (l. 86). This line and the following lines of vague physical description suggest that the author wants readers to conjure up the image of a monster in their own minds instead of having to create one for them. Still, the author's inflated language puts evil ferocity in their heads to shape how they imagine him around mostly negative thoughts. It is likely that this demon is large, dark, and frightening, but beyond that the reader must construct his own Grendel. Later, he is called grim as if to solidify his already dismal disposition (l. 122). Each word employed to depict Grendel is strongly negative and connotative of evil. This is done purposefully; it makes him an adversary from the start. He starts out as evil, then initiates the conflict and remains an antagonist until death. Strong and intentional elevated language contributes greatly to this status, even in the vagueness of his physical description. It is clear that one look upon Beowulf brings amazement while one look upon Grendel brings terror. Another way the author heightens Beowulf's character is by singling him out as a hero. Just before his showdown with Grendel the author forecasts the imminent outcome of Beowulf's clash with the beast saying, Through the strength of one they all prevailed; / they would crush their enemy and come through/ in triumph and gladness (l. 698-700). Of course this is a reference to Beowulf's conquest over Grendel, but this passage is more important for its implications. It likens Beowulf to Christ in that his people gain victory over their foe (Grendel, or the devil in this sense) through him (and him only). Certainly Beowulf isn't portrayed as a deity himself; nonetheless, the parallel to Christ stands as useful since, like him, everyone is dependent on Beowulf for deliverance. Later in the poem, Beowulf is lifted up again. Before seeking his vengeance on Grendel's mother, King Hrothgar tells Beowulf that redemption is in his hands and his hands only (l. 1376-7). He is their sole hope, and the word choice of the piece makes this quite clear. Beowulf's individuality is highlighted again a few lines later. As Grendel sneaks into the hall to wreak havoc on the men of Heorot, everyone is asleep  except Beowulf. The text states, The hall-guards were slack, asleep at their posts, / all except one&/ One man, however, was in fighting mood, / awake and on edge, spoiling for action (l. 704-5, 708-9). Here, Beowulf is set apart from other men and placed above them. On this occasion, his preparedness to fight is put on display. As much as the narrator of the tale does to individualize Beowulf, he distances himself from others with his speech before taking on his final foe, the dragon. He tells the men accompanying him that the battle is not theirs to fight, and that it is only up to him to display his might against the dragon. This is one moment where Beowulf declares his own independence. His words reflect his self-confidence and courage. While Beowulf stands as the hope of mankind, Grendel remains the opposite. The author calls him God-cursed and The bane of the race of men (l. 712). These lines tell the reader exactly who Grendel is with respect to man and God. He is an enemy and it is his evil presence that necessitates the coming of Beowulf in the first place. It is Beowulf's single effort that dooms Grendel but, before this happens, Grendel's onslaught is defined as a me-against-the-world type of venture (l. 144-5). So we see how Beowulf and Grendel play off each other. Beowulf is the people's champion while the monster is the lonely public enemy number one. The diction of the author foils Beowulf as a creator and preserver with Grendel as a destroyer. Looking at the initial description of Beowulf in the poem, he is portrayed in the following way: There was no one else like him alive. / In his day, he was the mightiest man on earth (l. 196-7). The author could have called him special and he could have called him mighty, but by including exactly how special and mighty, the reader sees Beowulf in a different light. Specifically, the author utilizes the superlative form often in his descriptions of Beowulf. Above, he is referred to as unlike any other and mightiest. Elsewhere he is conveyed as strongest of warriors (l. 1544), [best]/ to raise a shield or to rule a kingdom (l. 859-60), and unequaled in the quest for glory (l. 2645). The superlative form heightens Beowulf's character to otherwise unattainable levels and displays him as heroic in nearly every sense of the word. On the other hand, there is strong (nearly superlative) language showing Grendel to be just as evil as Beowulf is good. Grendel is called The captain of evil (l. 749). Calling him a captain is very important to the reader's perception of Grendel as an antagonist. A captain is a leader who generally teaches others to do as he does (in this case, evil). By this, it can be inferred that Grendel is not simply a misunderstood figure gone wrong. Rather, he is a lost cause, fully corrupted and leading the charge against anything good. This point is furthered when the text says that Grendel ruled in defiance of right (l. 144). Here, we see that the monster has no excuse for his ways. In order to defy something, a person must know it first. So Grendel knows goodness and has consciously chosen to carry out evil in its place. He is everything humans strive to avoid and everything Beowulf is not. By utilizing specific diction, the author has achieved his aim at polarizing Beowulf and Grendel (l.164-6). Most important of the near-superlative descriptions of Grendel are those that speak to his lack of moral convictions. He is intriniscally hateful and shameless (l. 137) and is totally numb to human suffering (119-20). It makes sense that his arch-enemy is exactly the opposite, and is called the man most gracious and fair-minded, / kindest to his people of all the rulers in the world (l. 3180-2). The evidence is clear; Grendel is the anti-hero. The extravagant (and almost exaggerated) style of the narrative makes it all the more lucid that Grendel is perfectly foiled with Beowulf. As inverses, they still share one common characteristic  incredible strength. We know from Unferth that no man has ever survived a tangle with Grendel (l. 525-8). Beowulf's military record is likewise. Something has to give. Fortunately, for the forces of good, it is Grendel's shoulder that does. As is clear, Grendel is set up to be the antithesis of Beowulf. But the elevated diction of the narrative creates more than just a simple protagonist-antagonist relationship between the two. It is said, As long as either lived, / he was hateful to the other (l. 813-4). They despised each other to the point that each of their purposes was to destroy the other. Without the great emphasis on unambiguously good and bad characteristics and words assigned to each character, much would have been lost to the reader from their epic relationship as foils.

ENG.G0.22.1,Autumnal Imagery in Austen's Persuasion,English,Argumentative Essay,"Persuasion was Jane Austen's last novel, completed shortly before her death, at a time when, according to Virginia Woolf in The Common Reader, Austen was just beginning to reach a new literary maturity. This last work includes less dialogue and more reflection, and Austen's observations of humanity are less of facts and more of feelings (Woolf 144). Woolf believes that the story's heavier discussion of emotion proves that Jane Austen had loved and that she was no longer afraid to say so (Woolf 144). Having had this experience in her life, and writing with the knowledge that she was coming closer to her death, Austen dwells frequently upon the beauty and the melancholy of nature, upon the autumn where she had been wont to dwell upon the spring (Woolf 144). Anne Elliot manifests this pleasure in autumn in the novel, and mirrors Austen's own state of experience and lost love. To be in the November of life and still be beautiful and happy, as Captain Wentworth wishes for Louisa (Austen 81-2), is what Anne also wishes for. Through autumnal imagery, Persuasion shows that a mature love and a relationship later in life, without the bloom of youth still attached, is just as solid and fulfilling, if not more so, than those in their spring of life. Even from the beginning of the novel, the narrator comments that Anne is already past the spring season of her life: A few years before, Anne Elliot had been a very pretty girl, but her bloom had vanished early (7). However, Anne has also not yet reached her November of life (82). When Wentworth uses this term with Louisa, he refers to the time of life at which point he believes it will be evident if character traits, such as persuadability or firmness of character, remain true and steadfast. Although not yet to that point, Anne is certainly nearing the autumn of her life, post-bloom and youth. Austen may have seen herself at the November of her own life: post-romance (or romance cut short) and, because of illness, near to death. However, Anne, and presumably Austen as well, sees autumn as a beautiful and important season. Anne reflects upon the pleasure she will receive from the view of the last smiles of the year upon the tawny leaves and withered hedges, and from repeating to herself some few of the thousand poetical descriptions extant of autumn, that season of peculiar and inexhaustible influence on the mind of taste and tenderness, that season which has drawn from every poet, worthy of being read, some attempt at description, or some lines of feeling. (78) Autumn incites meditation and deep feeling that is worthy and enjoyable to remember. This quote is perhaps a self-conscious statement, because Austen herself acts as a poet describing the beauty of the season with feeling here, especially in the line, the last smiles of the year upon the tawny leaves and withered hedges. It is clear that Austen, and Anne, value autumn, especially as a poetic theme. With such beauty and worth associated with it, autumn, be it in season of the year or season of life, is far from being a completely undesirable state. Indeed, when it seems that Anne will be leaving the countryside right away to go to Bath with her father and sister, she reflects that she will miss all the influence so sweet and so sad of the autumnal months in the country (32). She will miss the beauty of the season, a beauty which comes not because of the bright, happy feelings attending to it, but from its sweetness and sadness. Anne herself, described not exactly as bright and chipper, could be described in the terms of her depiction of autumn, as so sweet and so sad. Her sweet, kind nature is evident in her dealings with (and contrast to) Mary, in the Croft's and Musgroves' admiration of her, and in Lady Russell's favor for her. Her sadness is evident in her loss of bloom and spirit resulting from her broken heart. However, spring's splendor still boldly interrupts this quiet autumnal beauty. When Anne overhears Wentworth and Louisa talking about their ideas of admiration and love during their group walk, her own meditation is disturbed. Louisa's spring-like youthfulness and conviction overpower Anne's passive, hidden, age-cured love and ideas about it. Louisa's energetic, blooming show of emotion is a jolt to Anne: The sweet scenes of autumn were for a while put byunless some tender sonnet, fraught with the apt analogy of the declining year, with declining happiness, and the images of youth and hope, and spring, all gone together, blessed her memory (79). When confronted with spring, autumn often seems pale in comparison. Anne acknowledges here these negative connotations of the fall season, connotations of decline in seasonal comfort and decline in pleasure. Her personal situation of declineher early loss of bloom and spirits (28)is apparent in contrast to Louisa's energy. Her own autumnal situation seems not the view of the last smiles of the year upon the tawny leaves and withered hedges, poetic and sweet, but merely a solitary withered hedge, sadly standing next to a bright, blooming young bud. When Anne then attempts to rise herself out of this moment of melancholy by questioning the group about a different topic, nobody heard, or, at least, nobody answered her (79). The others ignore her, or at least do not notice her, in favor of paying attention to more blooming, youthful, hopeful girls in the springs of their lives. But, in the end, despite this discouragement, the mature, poetical autumn prevails over the spring. Louisa's bold assertions of character lead to her injury and to alteration of her outlook and personality. At the same time as these consequences of an over-exuberance of the spring of life, Austen shows that Anne's leaves are not completely withered. Mr. Elliot notices her very regular, very pretty features, having the bloom and freshness of youth restored by the fine wind which had been blowing on her complexion, and by the animation of eye which it had also produced (97). This helps Captain Wentworth recall what he so admired in her eight years beforehand. Anne hopes to be blessed with a second spring of youth and beauty (115), but is still able to be striking and admirable in her autumn. When she visits Mrs. Smith, the narrator comments on Anne's change, from the blooming, silent, unformed girl of fifteen, to the elegant little woman of seven and twenty, with every beauty excepting bloom, and with manners as consciously right as they were invariably gentle (144). She has a more seasoned beauty, and her increased maturity is apparent in her increased understanding. She understands the reasons why she was able to be so persuaded when she was younger, and she understands that she would have been happier if she had not allowed herself to be persuaded (29). Anne's mature meditation to Captain Harville on the constancy of women and men's feelings is a meditation which could only occur at this later point in her life. It is the final cue for Wentworth to express his feelings, which have also remained constant after the early spring of both of their lives. Deferring their romance until after Anne's youthful bloom actually ensured their later contentment: both reveal their feelings and are more exquisitely happy, perhaps, in their re-union, than when it had been first projected; more tender, more tried, more fixed in a knowledge of each other's character, truth, and attachment; more equal to act, more justified in acting (225). If they had been married in their early years, they would not have been so devoted and committed. Now with greater understanding and more developed emotion, their union is more solid. The happiness resulting from Anne learning happiness as she grew older (29) is worth the wait. Other couples more in the spring of their lives in the novel are also happy, but most have also gone though some sort of maturation experiences before their marriages. Louisa has been sobered by her accident, and Henrietta reigned in by her brief flirtation with (and rejection by) Captain Wentworth. And even with these experiences, from the narrator's perspective, no alliance is as fulfilling as Anne and Wentworth's long-awaited union. Indeed, Anne's time of real action and joy comes in the autumn of her life, represented by her meditation on the season throughout the novel. The loss of her own spring did not ruin her chancesshe certainly will continue to be beautiful and happy in the remaining autumn and November of her life with Captain Wentworth.

ENG.G0.23.1,Milton's Relativism ,English,Argumentative Essay,"Adam and Eve are fortunate enough to reside in Earth's paradise, the Garden of Eden. In this original human home, the air is pure, the trees are loaden with fairest fruit (IV, 147), and man and beast get along swimmingly, playing and chasing one another. The humans who reside in this paradise would find it rather perfect, if only it didn't bore them. For although Eden is perfect, living there for all of eternity is a static, confining existence, especially to Adam and Eve, who reject stasis and embrace motion. For instance, despite the fact that her only experience of weather is the temperate atmosphere of Eden, Eve expresses her preference for the fluctuating conditions of the year's seasons: All seasons and their change all please alike (IV, 640). Likewise, the text's angels and Satan himself represent the excitement of movement on a basic physical level. Satan is often flying around the universe, or creeping and roaming, as in his first visit to Eden, Through wood, through waste, o'er hill, o'er dale his roam (IV, 538). The angels of heaven, who frequently chase Satan are echo his universal movement (as summarized by the footnote to IV, 862): Starting in the east of Paradise, they encircle the garden on either side and meet again in the extreme west, where Uthuriel and Zephon conduct Satan. Images of the excitement and vitality of change and movement saturate this text. It is Adam who proposes a theory for why humans (and, by extension, demons and angels) desire such kinetic change. Those other than God can never achieve a state of true, complete satisfaction; because their state is naturally deficient (whereas God's is naturally complete), they will always yearn for something outside of themselves. God alone is able to achieve perfection of himself: To attain / the heighth and depth of Thy eternal ways / All human thoughts come short, Supreme of Things. / Thou in Thyself art perfect and in Thee / Is no deficience found (VIII, 412-416). Adam then notes the human instinct to yearn for such perfection: Not so is Man [perfect], / But in degree, the cause of his desire / By conversation with his like to help / Or solace his defects (VIII, 416-419). Everyone in the universe, apart from God, is unable to enjoy stasis, because no one apart from God is perfect (and satisfied) in a motionless state. That is not to say that these creatures are able to attain perfection in their motion; indeed, they will be imperfect regardless of their actions. But, as Adam states, movement toward something outside one's own deficient self (in his case, movement toward Eve) is an attempt to further approach the type of perfection that God enjoys. The best example of this movement toward perfection is the fact that Adam and Eve have the potential to one day become angels themselves, a significant step up on the scala natur�. Coupled with this emphasis on movement and change is an emphasis on cognitive relativism. That is, the way realities are perceived in the book is dependent on the experience of the character. Satan, rather portentously, is the first to mention this idea of experience as not an absolute, but rather a subjective notion that hinges on past experiences: Me Miserable! Which way shall I fly / Infinite wrath and infinite despair? / Which way I fly is Hell, myself am Hell, / And in the lowest deep a lower deep / Still threat'ning to devour me opens wide, / To which the Hell I suffer seems a Heav'n (IV, 73-78). He expresses a similar sentiment when he spies on Eden's humans and imagines them in hell: More woe the more your taste is now of joy! (IV, 369) Eve expresses the same relativistic preoccupation, albeit in a much more innocent sense, as she worries that the beauty of Eden is wasted while she and Adam sleep: But wherefore all night long shine [the stars]? For whom / This glorious sight when sleep hath shut all eyes? (IV, 657-8) The footnote to this line further illuminates Eve's meaning: things are not of value in themselves but only as they are perceived and shared (pg 95). Whereas Eve merely ponders such relativism, Adam notes his experience of it, noting that his perfect Eden became even more perfect with the addition of Eve: what seemed fair in all the world seemed now / Mean (VIII, 472-3). This relativism is linked with the text's emphasis on movement in an important way  it is the human desire for change that allows us new and different perspectives. This link is also crucial for Eve's sense of her own reality and experience. As one who has acquired, in her entire life thus far, only one state of being (in her case, the joy of living in Eden), she is utterly unable to appreciate this happy state. She lacks the crucial variety of experience that allows one to feel not only appreciative of happiness, but to truly understand happiness  for to understand happiness is to experience comparative unhappiness. It is useful to first examine Adam's creation and movement of happiness, in order to understand how Eve's creation and existence fundamentally differ. As Adam awakens for the first time, his first act is to recognize his dependence on God: fair creatures, tell, / Tell if ye saw how cam I thus, how here. / Not of myself: by some great Maker, then, / In goodness and in pow'r preeminent (VIII, 276-9). His first speech thus establishes himself as the dependent, deficient creature, whose first impulse is to need God: Tell me how may I know Him, how adore (VIII, 280). Yet after God speaks to him, [he] want[ed] still (VIII, 355). Despite his professed happiness, he desires greater happiness, for In solitude, / What happiness? Who can enjoy alone / Or all enjoyment what contentment find? (VIII, 364-366)1 Along with this relativistic pondering, Adam also dislikes the stasis of the prospect of being alone from all eternity (VIII, 406). Adam's original state is one that questions the reality of his happiness and rejects a static state of being. In response to his question of Is this happiness? he is granted Eve, and can now definitively state This is happiness. The fact that he is granted two states of being  one pre-Eve and one post-Eve  is enough to allow him a measure of comparison that endows an authority to his feelings. In achieving greater happiness, he is also partially cured of his human deficiency, and better able to approach perfection. Adam's idea of perfection resembles the Platonic creation story of humans, who were perfect in their cylindrical, merged state. Adam desires that Eve be his other half, and adhere/ And they shall be one flesh, / one heart, / one soul (VIII, 498-9). Adam is also depicted as being changed post-Eve. Not only has he reached a higher plane of happiness, but he has also evolved. As a result of Eve, he senses a Sweetness into my heart, unfelt before (VIII, 475). This evolution, however, isn't quite perfect enough to allow for satisfaction in stasis (which only God can achieve). Instead, Adam is subject to a now constant flow of desire: In all enjoyments else / Superior and unmoved, here only weak / Against the charm of beauty's powerful glance (VIII, 531-3). Desire is never at rest, but instead sweet intercourse, / Of looks and smiles (VIII, 538). As the footnote to this line notes, intercourse here means exchange; literally 'running between'(pg 203). Thus Adam's urge for movement is realized, as his very desire for Eve is kinetic. His understanding of his own happiness has also been achieved, as he has experienced two states of being. Eve's downfall is that she is not allowed the breadth of experience Adam is, nor his realization of movement. Unlike Adam, Eve is never given the opportunity to understand her own joy; it is simply what is she is not able to judge it good or bad, as she has no experience to judge it against. Milton demonstrates Eve's lack of ability to understand her condition by portraying Satan's full enjoyment of Eden. Satan, in having the experience of Hell, can fully understand the beauty of Eden: As one who long in populous city pent / Where houses thick and sewers annoy the air / Forth issuing on a summer's morn to breathe / Among the pleasant villages and farms / Adjoined, from each thing met conceives delight (IX, 445-9). Eve is truly incapable of such an understanding of Eden, rendered ignorant in her experience of only one state of being. Eve's awakening also fundamentally differs from Adam's. Upon realizing consciousness, Eve doesn't immediately sense that she lacks, as Adam does. She instead finds herself to be quite satisfying enough: Pleased [the reflection] returned as soon with answering looks / Of sympathy and love (IV, 464-5). The scenario of Eve immediately yearning for both God and a partner, as Adam does, never materializes; it is clear that her kinetic energy will be directed elsewhere. Eve then disrupts Adam's notions of Platonic union: Yet methought (Adam) less fair, / Less winning soft, less amiably mild / Than that smooth wat'ry image: back I turned (IV, 478-80). In fact, the language of Eve's description of encountering Adam hints at the kinetic nature of her own state, as she was initially unwilling to go to him, using phrases such as What could I do / But follow (IV, 475-6) and thy gentle hand / Seized mine, I yielded (IV, 487-9). It is unfortunate that Eve does not desire Adam as much as he desires her; if she did, it is true she would still not realize her own happiness, but the Fall would have never occurred  the two would have been united when Satan arrived. Two of Eve's conditions essentially caused the Fall to occur. The first is Eve's inconstancy of desire. Her tendency toward movement differs from Adam's  it is not continually directed toward him, but instead ebbs and flows. She moves from not desiring Adam (above), to desiring him, as when Satan views them in their conjugal bliss: Nor gentle purpose nor endearing smiles / Wanted, nr youthful dalliance as beseems / Fair couple linked in happy nuptial league (IV, 337-9). She then moves from desiring Adam to tiring of him, when she suggests that they part: Let us divide our labors (IX, 214). The second condition is that Eve is denied the opportunity to understand her own happiness, and will thus move toward change with even more urgency, for she desires a basic measure of comparison. For Eve, parting from Adam is an attempt to experience the change she yearns for, as is evident in the way she presents her argument. She first expresses frustration with the lack of meaningful change in Eden, calling it a narrow circuit (IX, 323) (certainly no evolution or progress can be tracked on a circuit). She then questions the reality of her happiness: And what is faith, love, virtue unassayed, / Alone, without exterior help sustained?&Frail is our happiness if this be so / And Eden were no Eden thus exposed! (IX, 335-41) Although her argument attempts to persuade Adam that their faith should be tested, she also wants to explore if the state of her happiness is in fact frail, or if it is happiness at all. Despite the narrator's earlier warning, Sleep on / Blest pair and O yet happiest if ye seek / No happier state and know no more! (IV, 773-5), the fact that Eve has been pondering relativism leaves her susceptible to an agent who might propose change. And such an agent soon presents himself. Satan, who we have previously seen flying around the universe in a prolonged burst of kinetic energy, represents Eve's wish for movement and change. As he tempts Eve, he casts her as one Deterred not from achieving what might lead / To happier life, knowledge of good and evil? (IX, 696-7). Intriguingly, Satan doesn't promise that such knowledge will lead to a happier life, but only that it might. This doesn't discourage Eve, however  she only seeks an altered state in order to experience more fully, not necessarily a happier one. Indeed, she doesn't even truly understand what happiness is. Therefore, it only a matter of course that Satan's promises too easy an entrance won (IX, 734) for he offers exactly what she is looking for. Perhaps surprisingly, Satan's promise holds fast, and Eve experiences the different state that she sought: Experience next, to thee I owe, / Best guide. Not foll'wing thee, I had remained / In ignorance (IX, 807-9). Finally, Eve has the experience be her own judge of happiness and sadness, as she has experienced two states of being: obedience and defiance. This episode, however, emphasizes the fact that the reality of events is next to irrelevant; it is only Eve's experience of reality that matters. When Eve eats the apple, the narrator notes her pleasure is Regarded, / such delight till then as seemed / In fruit she never tasted whether true / Or fancied so (IX, 787-9, emphasis mine). The amount of relativist modifiers Milton managed to pack in this one crucial line is impressive in itself. He wants to be certain we understand that Eve's knowledge of good and evil only exists on a subjective personal landscape, unlike God's absolute notions of good and evil. Unfortunately, this type of discernment is the only kind available to humans. Adam was able to experience such discernment in pleasing God with his questions and being granted the gift of Eve. Eve, however, obtained the ability of discernment only by disobeying God. Thus, both acquired the knowledge by altering their states of being. The Fall is not fundamentally a conflict of love, but rather the unshakable human desire for change and understanding. As this perpetual desire for change is but a byproduct of humans' lack of perfection, the solution to the Fall is almost redundant: humanity fell because of its imperfection.

ENG.G0.24.1,Contradiction and Religious Critique: The Pardoner in The Canterbury Tales,English,Argumentative Essay,"� Geoffrey Chaucer's writing is able to maintain interest to modern audiences despite having been written approximately six hundred years ago. This continuing fascination is due in no small part to his sharp satirical mind and his unmistakable criticisms of the existing religious hierarchy, particularly vibrant in the Canterbury Tales. From the General Prologue's ironic portraits of the various religious pilgrims to specific tales from and about religious figures, the work uses subtle linguistic variation and blatant criticism to draw attention to inconsistencies and possible points of contention within Chaucer's contemporary religious environment. The Pardoner's portrait, prologue, and tale use both plot-oriented and poetry-oriented contradictions to create a specific and intricate condemnation of common contemporary religious practices that illuminates Chaucer's overarching views on 14th century religious practices. When examining the Pardoner's portrait, it is important to begin with its placement within the set of pilgrims' portraits. The Pardoner is not grouped with other second estate figures such as the Friar and Monk, but is instead listed among the last of the pilgrims: Ther was also a Reve, and a Millere,/ A Sumnour, and a Pardoner also,/ A Maunciple, and myself- ther were namo (GP I. 542-544). While even the hypocritical, monetary-minded Friar is placed directly after the Monk, the Pardoner appears with the coarsest of the pilgrims. The Miller is the pilgrim who drunkenly interrupts the Host's preferred order of social deference (MP I.3120) and, in doing so, represents the voice of the commoners as opposed to the elite. By placing the Pardoner among these pilgrims, Chaucer (as narrator) is passing judgment on the Pardoner's character and worth. The Pardoner, when judged by the company he keeps, comes off as lowly and somewhat extortionate, especially as the characters of his companions are revealed. The Reeve and the Miller squabble within their tales, introducing a level of crudeness to the tale-telling game quite different than the courtly Knight's Tale implies. The Summoner, with whom the Pardoner appears to be close (GP I. 669), is also criticized heavily (although by the questionably noble Friar), both explicitly in a prologue and figuratively in a tale. Though relations between the characters in the Canterbury Tales are often strained and criticism between characters is often somewhat dubious (easily attributed to or indicative of general social position), Chaucer reserves some of his most outrageously immoral acts for the Miller, Reeve, and the summoner in the Friar's tale. It is no accident that the Pardoner appears alongside these men: as readers become aware of the company the Pardoner keeps, it becomes easier to predict his behavior and characterization. Even among this undesirable group of ruffians, the Pardoner's portrait comes last and is noticeably concerned with his appearance. Nine full lines (GP I. 675-681) are devoted to the way in which he wears his hair, a seemingly irrelevant detail but one which helps illustrate the ways in which Chaucer is setting him up to be a frivolous religious figure. The Pardoner attempts to cultivate a modern, sleek appearance but instead appears foolish to his companions. The narrator notes his attempt when saying, Hym thoughte he rood al of the newe jet (GP I. 682). It is important, however, that the Pardoner's reasons for wearing his hair as he does are attributed to his mind rather than a shared sense of style. The Pardoner thinks he is up to date and fashionable, but Chaucer gives no hints that his self-evaluation is correct. The use of adjectives such as thynne and dischevelee, as well as a direct comparison to flax, imply a certain distaste for the Pardoner's sense of style amongst the group as a whole and creates a noticeable gulf between the Pardoner's personal evaluations and consensus opinions. Adding to this sense of critique is the emergence of a primarily physical description: the Pardoner's portrait places equal emphasis on his appearance and his possessions, allowing for his demeanor in religious duties and preaching mostly at the end of his portrait and then only as an afterthought. The primary view of the Pardoner that Chaucer offers is that of a man trying incredibly hard to appear legitimate and on the cutting edge of society, only to fail and worrying excessively over his appearance. Following this description of the Pardoner as overly concerned with physicality (and also incorrectly applying that concern) is an interesting rhyme that recalls the beginning of the portrait and illuminates Chaucer's early bias against the Pardoner. Chaucer directly belittles the Pardoner's sense of stature and papal connections when he is Bretful of pardoun comen from Rome al hoot./ A voys he hadde as small as hath a goot (GP I. 687-688). The line concerning Papal pardons is sandwiched between a note about the Pardoner's sack and of his apparently grating voice, rhyming with goot and forming a decidedly unfavorable comparison. By associating the line about pardons with the goat, a traditional implication of Satan, Chaucer is commenting, although slightly and indirectly, on the quality of the Pardoner's supposed absolution. This decidedly negative connotation sets up another comparison to brutish animals (horses, GP I.691) and immediately precedes the direct discussion of the Pardoner's methods. More importantly, however, it is a repetition of a poetic technique used at the very beginning of the portrait, before any discussion of the Pardoner's appearance. The unlikely and almost blasphemous juxtaposition of Rome with trivial or inhuman elements in fact occurs twice within the portrait, and though the first comparison is to a song (not as overtly devilish as a goat), the rhyme in both cases trivializes Rome and the act of pilgrimage itself. Where the opening of the portrait could easily lead into a discussion, or even condemnation, of the Pardoner's actions, Chaucer instead digresses into a treatise on appearance. The Pardoner has come straight from Rome (GP I.671), but apparently all he has to show for it is a jolly attitude and penchant for singing love songs. The direct rhyme between Rome and to me in the first lines and the close connection between visiting Rome and having the voice of a goat undermine the Pardoner's attempts at spiritual gravity and set up the direct condemnations that follow. Chaucer's narrator is not subtle in criticizing the Pardoner and his physical attributes, but he is ruthless when describing the Pardoner's possessions. While the other General Prologue portraits tend to be forgiving and positive in their descriptions, the Pardoner is openly ridiculed throughout. The narrator repeatedly trumps the Pardoner's voice: gone are the ventriloquisms of the Friar and Prioress. With regards to the Pardoner, Chaucer is markedly skeptical: lines 695 and 696 repeat he seyde when referring to the Pardoner's possessions. The repetition underlines the lack of trust and respect towards him; he is not taken seriously for a second and his words are repeated to draw ridicule. Chaucer's repetition here draws attention to the separation between narrative voice and character voice in the Pardoner's portrait, and while this makes the ventriloquism of earlier portraits more easily recognizable, it distances the reader from the Pardoner and excludes the possibility of sympathy. Compounding the Pardoner's already considerable problems of credibility is the outright dismissal of his relics. When he seyde that his relics had certain origins, there is a possibility that the Pardoner is correct. This room for vindication is removed when the narrator refers to a certain relic solely as pigges bones (700); these are not even afforded the Pardoner's description but are dismissed immediately as fakes. Chaucer deliberately breaks form and openly despises and distrusts the Pardoner from his first observations of physical appearance to a description of occupation and preaching. The description of the Pardoner's normal mode of operation is unsurprisingly unsympathetic given the portrait's general treatment of his character. It is no surprise that the Pardoner uses feyned flattery and japes, along with his false relics, to get moore moneye/ Than that [a poor] person gat in monthes tweye (GP I.703-705): the portrait has been laced throughout with references to deceit and a fundamental disconnect between the Pardoner's presentation of reality and a reasonable construction thereof. This straightforward examination (and implied condemnation) is, however, unique to the Pardoner's portrait and conspires along with its placement to belittle the Pardoner at every turn and even when the Pardoner is granted talent (his resemblance to a goat does not impede his singing of offertories (GP I.710)), he is roundly abused. Chaucer intends his praise of the Pardoner's singing ironically, focusing on an already negative trait and linking good deeds only to the prospect of financial gain. The Pardoner's portrait is throughout brimming with irony and contradictory phrases and rhymes that offset any religious authority the man might have. The lengthy focus on appearance does not deviate entirely from Chaucer's previous representations of religious figures, but it does place an unusual emphasis on the Pardoner's deliberate attempts to seem admirable. Whereas Chaucer simply presents the table manners of the Prioress (GP I.127-135), the Pardoner's portrait focuses on the distinction between personal presentation and actuality. By proposing reasons behind the Pardoner's actions, Chaucer contradicts his previous stance of absolute naivet� and shows a level of perception difficult to gauge from the preceding portraits. This essential contradiction in the narrator's demeanor is present amongst contradictory passages within the text itself. Rhymes that couple holy Rome with frivolity or, worse, devilry force readers to consider the holiness of this religious figure and, as an extention, the religious system itself. A religious climate that encourages absolution at (literally) any price is subtly criticized when a figure embodying its contradictions is held up to direct and unsparing scrutiny. It is not only in his General Prologue portrait that the Pardoner is criticized; his prologue and tale go further in presenting contradictory condemnations of his preaching and practice. The Pardoner is again routinely attacked from the moment he is asked to tell a tale. The tale he follows is the Physician's Tale, a story concerned with moral purity; the Pardoner is conceived as its antidote. Telle us som myrthe or japes right anon (ParI VI.319) commands the Host, assuming that the Pardoner is not to be taken seriously and also assuming that his tale would, as a matter of course, lack sufficient gravity. The Pardoner is viewed as comic relief instead of as a legitimate religious representative or member of the second estate. As in the General Prologue, the Pardoner is placed on a relatively equal footing with the Miller and Reeve, each of whom told humorous tales of no great moral consequence; the Pardoner is expected to do the same. He obliges in good faith, but not before another criticism is leveled. The Host does not want the Pardoner to drink before telling his story, to which the Pardoner replies, I moot thynke/ Upon som honest thyng while that I drynke (ParI VI.327-328). The tale that the Pardoner ends up telling, however, is a repetition of the sermon he usually delivers to the masses, as far from an honest thyng as he can come. He attempts to fleece his fellow pilgrims, a dishonest action itself stemming from the inability to think of an honest thing even after claiming to attempt to do so. There are two levels of dishonesty and contradiction stemming from this line alone, the line that introduces the Pardoner's portion of the Canterbury Tales, defining it (at least in retrospect) as a particularly tricky and devious part of the collection. Even more striking than the Pardoner's inability to succumb to drunken honesty (potentially excusable on account of drunkenness but important nonetheless) is the Pardoner's completely incorrect illustration of a Biblical verse. The Pardoner is a religious figure who preaches Radix malorum est Cupiditas (ParP 334) just before attempting to lull his audience into trust and, eventually, extort radical payments for dubious coupons of salvation. This is hypocrisy in its barest form: the Pardoner undermines what he preaches by exercising the precise opposite. His character is defined by greed and a love of money. In choosing this Biblical maxim to represent the Pardoner, Chaucer is calling attention to the problems inherent within a church that allows such practices without openly condemning them. In presenting the Pardoner as completely and entirely outrageous, viewed as nothing but a joke by his companions, Chaucer is placing religious criticism in the mouth of a buffoon, making it more tolerable and easing it into the fabric of the Canterbury Tales. What the Pardoner does through his tale is symbolize an industry of religion that develops throughout the Pardoner's entire performance. The Pardoner sets the mood by beginning with scripture presuming that, when he comes to undermine it later, his audience will not notice or will be too ashamed not to contribute to the pot, believing that the Pardoner does not accept money from any wight&That hath doon synne horrible (ParP 378-379). This backwards method of enforcing compliance (and lining the Pardoner's pockets) turns religion into a social practice and draws it away from themes of repentence or absolution: a person hearing the tale who thickens the Pardoner's coffers may be doing so not out of a desire for absolution but to avoid seeming sinful to his neighbors. The sleight of hand practiced by the Pardoner uses scripture to promote the avarice it explicitly forbids. Taken alone, the Pardoner becomes a reprehensible individual who does not necessarily stand in for the church as a whole. Chaucer includes other religious figures in his work who seem more reasonable and, in the case of the Parson, are ideal representations of the religious life. The Pardoner is obviously intended to stand out and embody precisely everything wrong with religion: when Chaucer openly criticizes the Pardoner in his portrait, he is criticizing the specific character and maybe his profession as a whole, but the critique seems limited in scope. Chaucer builds on contradictions within the Pardoner's portrait and the fundamental contradiction of his tale to create a criticism of pardoners, who come to represent money in religion. After reading the Pardoner's attempts to fleece his flock, however, it is important to revisit the earlier religious portraits and observe how they are more like the Pardoner than is at first obvious. The Pardoner's Prologue and Tale are built on the contradiction between the Pardoner's words against greed and his greedy action; the intended effect is to enforce the original scripture (Radix malorum est Cupiditas) by presenting its abhorrent opposite. Easily forgotten in the Pardoner's extravagant flaunting of his own teachings are the contradictions within the Prioress's, Monk's, and Friar's portraits, which focus just as much on social status and physical appearances as does the Pardoner's, though they are treated with a certain degree of respect. Madame Eglentyne, for example, is ful simple and coy in the second line of her description (GP I.119); Chaucer goes on to speak of the characteristics of her voice and her wonderful table manners. The Monk is an excellent horseman who blatantly ignores the fact that traditional practice seith that hunters ben nat hooly men (GP I.178). His religious faults are masked within a venerating attitude of the adoring narrator, but it is clear that the Monk is more concerned with social status and the pursuits of the leisure class than living a sparse monastic life. The Friar is the worst offender of all, closely linked to the Pardoner through their mutual love of money. Though he hadde maad ful many a mariage/ Of yonge women at his owene cost (GP I.212-213), he is described as a member of a povre ordre (GP I.225). Both the Friar and the Pardoner embody precisely the opposite ideals than those they profess, and though the Friar is admired by Chaucer's narrator, he is no less guilty of similar sins. The Pardoner is only the most obvious of the religious sinners in the Canterbury Tales, and when the standards he implies are applied to the other second estate pilgrims in Chaucer's group, each one fails. The Prioress and Monk seem to excel at the type of posturing for which the Pardoner is ridiculed, forging identities outside of their religious vows and adopting the manners and hobbies of the leisure classes despised by the Biblical aversion to greed and wealth. The Pardoner serves as a key to unlock the deep religious criticism in the Canterbury Tales. Chaucer's obvious contempt towards the Pardoner dwarfs the subtlety of his other religious critiques but illuminates his vision of proper religious practice. The Pardoner is crafted to show where Chaucer stands and to elicit agreement; viewing the previous portraits with an eye towards Chaucer's ultimate end draws out contradictions within them and reveals that they are not so unlike the Pardoner themselves. The staggering inability of the clergy to follow one of the most basic tenets of the Bible and of the vows specific to their orders is a direct condemnation of the commercial nature of the 14th century church, a condemnation that flows from the disconnect between religious preaching and religious practice. This is borne out most fully by the reviled Pardoner but becomes evident in earlier portraits as well as the religious overtones of the Canterbury Tales congregate to form a unified vision of where, exactly, religion is going wrong.

ENG.G0.25.1,Sexualized Violence and Identity in Achy Obejas' Memory Mambo,English,Argumentative Essay,"Achy Obejas' Memory Mambo is composed of seemingly isolated incidents of sexualized violence. However, these moments of violence are connected by an undercurrent of trauma resulting from identities fragmented by colonial constructions of power and by displacement. Throughout the novel, these isolated incidents are denied or left unacknowledged, resulting in a growing sense of discomfort that culminates in a moment of narrative rupture when Jimmy sexually abuses Rosa. Jimmy's actions cannot be ignored or denied, and thus they finally raise the question of whether it is possible to have a resolution or whether this trauma will always be a part of the Casas family's life in America. In the novel, homosexual protagonist Juani Casas family's refusal to acknowledge her sexuality situates her as an outsider, while her violent act enmeshes her in the midst of the Casas family's unspoken cycle of violence. It is from this simultaneous position of outsider and active perpetrator of conflict and denial, that Juani is able to demonstrate at the very least, the need for open communication in the exiled Cuban community, in order to break the cycle of violence. The Las Casas family's Cuban history is defined by colonialism. In her article, Marked by Genetics and Exile: Narrativizing Transcultural Sexualities in Memory Mambo, Kate McCullough writes, The colonial legacy of violence inherent in racial formation, for example, vexes the family's account of its genealogy. Juani's mother's desire, for instance, emerges from this matrix: a ""caf� con leche mulata,"" she will ""do just about anything to deny her real lineage,"" and she considers Juani's father, ""green-eyed and very light-skinned,"" a ""prize"" (32). 584 Juani's mother occupies a unique position, because she was born into a newly independent Cuban society, yet a society that still contained the social hierarchy and racism of its colonized past. As a privileged member of this society, Juani's mother has internalized the racist colonial stereotypes, desiring to deny her real lineage (Obejas, 32). McCullough points out that Juani's mother objects not to the colonial system itself but to its micropractices; she objects neither to the sexual violence implicit in slavery nor even to the consequent racial hierarchies, but simply to the possibility that her family does not occupy a privileged position within them (McCullough, 585). This is further demonstrated by Juani's family's immigration to the United Stats, which is driven by Juani's mother after witnessing the revolution in 1959. Juani states, When the revolution triumphed in 1959, nothing stunned my mother more than the fact that crazy Raul and his black friends were riding on tanks with Fidel through the city&In that instant, my motherwho'd been struggling to pass her entire lifecould see that the order of things had just been altered (Obejas, 35). Juani's mother drives the Las Casas family to leave Cuba, because she cannot cope with the idea of a society without hierarchal definitions and the power imbalances they create. Though Juani's mother never actually experiences colonialism, she exhibits the distorted identity typical of a member of a colonized society. Bart Moore-Gilbert discusses Homi Bhabha's concept of mimicry in his book Post Colonial Theory: Contexts, Practices, Politics stating, The colonizer requires of the colonized subject that s/he adopt the outward forms and internalize the values and norms of the occupying power&At the heart of mimicry, then is a destabilizing 'ironic compromise'&the desire for a reformed, recognizable Other, as a subject of a difference that is almost the same, but not quite. (Moore-Gilbert, 120) Bhabha's concept of mimicry demonstrates one of the inherent contradictions in colonialism, the desire to create a subject that is almost the same, but not quite (Moore-Gilbert, 120). The colonizers' attempt to mold the colonized culture to their own, yet their refusal to fully accept them or acknowledge them as the same, inculcates the colonized culture with their stereotypes, while at the same time denying them power and mobility. Moore-Gilbert goes on to state that, The consequence of this, however, is quite contrary to the 'intention' of the colonizer, in that mimicry produces subjects whose 'not-quite sameness' acts like a distorting mirror which fractures the identity of the colonizing subject andas in the regime of stereotype- 'rearticulates [its] presence in terms of its ""otherness,"" that which it disavows.'(Moore-Gilbert, 121). By attempting to produce not-quite sameness (Moore-Gilbert, 121), the colonizers actually generate identities in the colonized culture that are distorted and confused because their attempts to be the same, only demonstrate their differences. I will argue that it is this fractured identity combined with the feelings of displacement that is largely responsible for the linked moments of sexualized violence present in Memory Mambo. In the Casas family, there is an added layer of complexity to this fractured identity. Kate McCullough discusses how Juani's mother's scripting of the family thus involves not only rewriting the past but producing the terms of the future (McCullough, 586). By fleeing to America,, Juani's mother is able to rewrite the past on her own terms, yet in doing so, she denies a past of racial impurity. McCullough argues that for the Casas family, Cuban exile results from a ight not simply from communism but from a new racial order made possible by Cuba's revolutionary social restructuring and the new forms of desire it might open (McCullough, 586). I will also attempt to demonstrate that by denying her family's past in an attempt to produc[e] the terms of the future (McCullough, 586), Juani's mother further fractures the Casas identity and condemns her family to a future of the sexualized violence inherent in racial formation (McCullough, 584) and to further exile. Juani Casas, Memory Mambo's protagonist has an identity further fractured by her homosexuality. For Juani, the impact of exile and her family's re-written identity leaves her aimless and unsure of what she wants. She states, I loved running the business, making decisions, having the respect of my family. But in my heart, I could not see myself here&The problem was, unlike Nena, who'd always wanted that PR career she was now off to in Miami, I had no clue what I could, or wanted, to do (Obejas, 97). Juani's confusion over her identity is increased when she falls in love with Gina, the Puerto Rican independentista. Juani does not consider herself to be political so she goes along with Gina's strong political beliefs stating, I really didn't care if she was a raving communist or a self-hating queer. Nothing mattered, nothing except the urgent, slippery sweetness between us (Obejas, 78). While Juani states that she does not care if Gina is a raving communist or a self-hating queer, the reality is that she can not ignore Gina's selectivity in choosing political causes worthy of a fight, because they affect their relationship, and ultimately destroy it. Juani finds that while she does not feel strongly about Cuban politics, in her relationship with Gina, she cannot escape them. Juani does not understand how Gina can ardently fight for Puerto Rican independence, while contentedly living the life of a closeted lesbian. Juani tells how Gina would respond to her discussion of queer politics: That's so white, this whole business of sexual identity' she'd say, while practically undoing my pants. But you Cubans, you think you're white& (Obejas, 78). Though Juani tries to ignore how politics negatively affects her relationship, eventually she cannot help but notice the problems caused by her and Gina's different political beliefs. After a year of dating, Gina tells Juani that she is not very happy with [their] relationship anymore&she [is] tired of coming over to my family's house and having to put up with my relatives, especially the men, making Puerto Rican jokes all the time, acting like Cubans were god's gift to the world (Obejas, 122). Though Juani's homosexuality isolates her from her family, Juani is deeply influenced by her family and is unable to form an identity outside of them. Kate McCullough states that Obejas' novel Locates its heroine in an extended Cuban American family that is itself located in larger, overlapping political contexts. Juani moves through the world of the novel in relation to her parents, sisters, cousins, t�os, and t�as, so her identity is produced in a largely heterosexual, ethnically marked community in which her lesbianism is tacitly understood but rarely explicitly recognized. Obejas argues that ""culturally we're dened by our families. In Memory Mambo, Juani doesn't just function in the world as a lesbian. Mostly she functions in the world of her family. Her community is her family""(McCullough, 583). Juani is deeply entangled in a large family with racist beliefs; her relationship with Gina does exist in a utopic world where politics do not matter. Juani constantly feels torn between her loyalty to her family, their traditions and their sense of humor and her love for Gina. She is unable to stand up to her family and tries to explain her family's disrespect away saying, I told her it was just a Cuban cultural thing, a generational thing, a Jimmy thing, but none of my words had any weight (Obejas, 123). Juani's fractured identity becomes increasingly evident in her relationship with Gina because in contrast to Gina who is strong and convicted in her beliefs, Juani appears weak and unable to stand up both to Gina, and to her family. It is this growing sense of confusion and lost identity that causes Juani to finally lash out at Gina with violence. The night of Juani and Gina's fight, one of Gina's friends calls Juani a Gusana, a bad Cuban. Juani asks Gina it is so despicable (Obejas, 132) that her family left Cuba, because her and Gina would never have met otherwise. But when Gina asks Juani whether she would have left Cuba if given the choice, Juani is speechless. She thinks, Who would I have been in Cuba? Who could I still be, in Cuba or here? (Obejas, 133). She realizes that she remembers little of Cuba but snatches of color and scattered words and wonders What did I really know? And who did I believe? Who could I believe?..Suddenly, I hated that I was just sitting there like a big black hole, like the mouth of one of those big industrial washers into which everybody just throws all their dirty clothes (Obejas, 133). After listening to Gina and her friends how much they know about Cuba, Juani finally recognizes her lack of identity and is furious. Juani does not know how to respond to her feelings of loss and displacement and lashes out at Gina with violence. Juani and Gina both end up at the hospital, where Caridad's husband Jimmy sees them and crafts a story to tell the rest of the family. Jimmy tells everyone that Juani and Gina were attacked in Ginas' apartment, and that because Gina believes it was politically motivated, Juani thinks it is too dangerous to be around Gina, so the two are parting ways. Juani allows her family to believe Jimmy's story and refuses to tell the truth about what truly happened between her and Gina. It is particularly significant that Jimmy creates Juani's cover story and hides the true nature of what happened between Juani and Gina, because one of the most interesting parallels drawn in the book is between Juani Casas, and Jimmy. Jimmy is also a perpetrator of domestic violence and he also has an identity that is fractured and confused by his experiences as a post-colonial Cuban exile. As the only out homosexual in her Cuban-American family, Juani feels an increased sense of displacement, because she is displaced from Cuba, and also feels alienated by her family. Jimmy feels a similar sense of loss, because he is displaced from his home, Cuba, but also feels isolated and alienated from his family. When Caridad first meets Jimmy, he tells her how he had been sent to the U.S. by himself on the Mariel boatlift, how he'd nearly died from dehydration and had to be hospitalized for weeks (Obejas, 43). Jimmy experiences the violence and trauma inherent in post-colonial Cuba and exile from Cuba at a young age. The Catholic Church places Jimmy with an American family in Indiana, who were kind to him but different from everything he'd ever known (Obejas, 44). Jimmy feels isolated from his American family, but does not realize how Americanized he has become until his real sister showed up from Cuba years later and he came to live with her, he didn't know her, and didn't know how to be with her. He'd say 'excuse me' all the time, preferred Folgers and eggs to Bustelo and toast for breakfast, and couldn't dance to save his life (Obejas, 44). Jimmy grows up without any clear sense of identityof who he is, or where he belongs. It is this anger over his displacement and his inability to belong in either world (Obejas, 44) that causes Jimmy to lash out at Caridad. One of the significant features of both Juani's and Jimmy's acts of violence is that they are perpetrated against loved ones. Both Juani and Jimmy have profound feelings of loss, yet they target those who are close to them. By targeting loved ones within their own community, it is as though Juani and Jimmy implicate the entire exiled Cuban community in their feelings of displacement, because no one is sure who to blame for them. However, there are unique features to the violence within Caridad and Jimmy's relationship that distinguish their relationship from Juani and Gina's relationship. Caridad and Jimmy's relationship is based on power imbalances and a desire to dominate one another. Though Caridad is initially drawn to Jimmy out of sympathy for the experiences he has had, their relationship quickly becomes about control and domination. Within the first twenty pages of Memory Mambo, Jimmy and Caridad fight because Caridad's father died and left her money and she wants to use it to buy a car, and Jimmy says no, they don't need a new car (Obejas, 15). However, the power imbalances in their relationship become immediately clear when Jimmy states that they have plenty of other debts to pay before buying something that luxurious. Besides, he sneers, where the hell does Caridad think she's going to go without him anyway (Obejas, 15). Jimmy immediately frames Caridad as the subordinated member of the relationship because she not only has to ask him for permission to use her own money, but also because by denying Caridad her own car, Jimmy denies Caridad her own sense of mobility and independence. However, in spite of Jimmy's control over her, Caridad maintains her own form of compromised agency. Caridad likes the dangers that come with men too, especially certain Latino men&It's not that she likes getting beat up&in fact, she hates itbut she relishes the role she gets to play in bringing down her bad boys. She likes making strong men weak& (Obejas, 17). Caridad and Jimmy's power dynamics are highly sexualized, with Jimmy using his masculinity to dominate Caridad because he is physically stronger, while Caridad uses her sexuality to dominate him. Juani tells how, after making Jimmy come, [Caridad] just loves to look at him, all wet and red and shrunken, as helpless and beautiful as a newborn baby (Obejas, 17). Both Caridad and Jimmy are enmeshed in the exiled post-colonial Cuban community and their fractured identities cause them to seek roles that alternatively subordinate and empower them. Jimmy's obsession with domination also plays out in his relationship with Juani. Jimmy does not like Juani, and does not want Juani interacting with Caridad. The first time Caridad leaves Juani and Jimmy alone, Jimmy sits on the couch, rubbing his penis until he has an erection. He then asks Juani, You ever want one of these?...Not inside you, but like, one of your own? (Obejas, 19). But Juani responds with cockiness stating, I get what I want; know what I mean (Obejas, 20). The two then sit while Jimmy loses his erection and Juani watches. Juani states, It was like a stand-off: dangerous, yes, but also just plain exhilarating. I went home that night and got off a dozen or so times just playing that scene in my head (Obejas, 20). Though Jimmy and Juani live in an exiled Cuban community, the politics of colonialism and the ways in which they play out in desire remain present. Of the characters in the Memory Mambo, Juani and Jimmy have arguably the most fractured and confused identities, and they are the two perpetrators of sexualized violence in the novel. Juani and Jimmy's struggle to define themselves results in violence against their partners, but also in a desire to remain in control of their lives and the people in them. Kate McCullough reiterates this point stating, Indeed Juani and Jimmy have been repeatedly gured as doubles, from his claim at the outset that ""Juani's just like me, we're two of a kind. . . . She'd do anything"" to Caridad's comment that the two are ""so alike"" (20, 144). Specifying the terms of the comparison, Caridad claims, to Juani's horror, that "". . . you two react to things the same way. . . . you talk alike, you even stand alike"" (145) Signicantly, Caridad's words suggest that Juani and Jimmy's similarity is ultimately grounded in control and a shared capacity for violence (McCullough, 598). Juani and Jimmy's struggle for power situates both characters simultaneously as doubles of one another and as rivals. Throughout the text, Jimmy uses his penis as a threat and as a weapon when he is trying to intimidate Juani or prove a point. When Jimmy tells Juani to stay away from Caridad, he hisses Do you fucking hear me, you little dyke? and then bumps her with his pelvis. He later gives himself an erection and asks Juani if she is jealous of his penis, telling her Maybe things would have worked out with you and Gina if you could have given her one of these huh? (Obejas, 56). Because Juani is a lesbian and is self-described as fairly masculine, tall, kind of big-boned and flat-chestedtomboyish too (Obejas, 20), for Jimmy, his penis is the most significant defining characteristic between Juani and himself, and he finds power in his masculinity. Interestingly, the healthiest relationships in the novel are among women who marry or date outside of the Cuban community. Juani's older sister Nena, moves to Miami and falls in love with Bernie Beck, who is black and half-Jewish. When Juani goes to visit Nena, she states It was wild to watch my normally tense and serious sister so playful and happy, as carefree as a co-ed during the first few days of school (Obejas, 171). The fact that one of the most successful relationships in the novel requires Nena to find a mate outside of the Cuban community reflects not only on the Cuban community but also on the Casas family. Juani states, I am as marked by genetics and exile as everyone else. . . . But...I'm also a stranger in my own family (79). Kate McCullough comments on Juani's feelings of alienation stating, If [Juani's] lesbianism emerges from the context of exile, then, it simultaneously constitutes a more metaphorical form of exile for her: exile within or from the family. However, I would argue that McCullough's assertion should be taken a step further. Though Juani's homosexuality increases her feelings of alienation from her family members, many of the other Casas family members experience exile within or from the family. In order to find happiness, Nena has to hide the truth about her boyfriend from her family, and has to leave Chicago to find herself. Nena tells Juani that even though I know [Mami's] whole thing about skin color is bullshit, it kept haunting me. You see, I know I would never give Bernie up because she won't approve, but I also know that my being with him is going to torture her, even though her reasons are totally fucked up (Obejas, 190). Nena demonstrates that while the insular Cuban exile community preserves tradition and memories, it can also be very detrimental to her generation. Instead of allowing herself to feel exiled within her family and community, Nena deliberately puts distance between herself and her family to develop her own identity and find happiness. Though Nena chooses to move to Miami so that she does not hurt her family with her choices, one of the most significant issues within the Casas family is that problems are either denied or simply not addressed. Though the entire family knows that Jimmy beats Caridad, no member of the family will confront Caridad. One day at the laundromat with Juani and Juani's mother, Tia Celia states, Being loyal to your husband does not mean letting him hit you (Obejas, 96). Yet, though Tia Celia acknowledges the violence, she refuses to talk to Caridad about it. Similarly, Juani's parents and the other members of their generation refuse to acknowledge Juani's homosexuality, though her girlfriends are present at family occasions. Even after the incident with Gina,, Juani tries to tell her mother that Jimmy exaggerated the story, and her mother responds whispering, Juani, no. Don't torture yourself with this. There are some things that are better left unspoken (Obejas, 141). However, it is this silence that is the common thread between the many isolated incidents of violence in the novel. Jimmy begins harassing Juani early on in his relationship with Caridad, yet Juani refuses to tell Caridad about Jimmy's grotesque sexual displays toward her. Jimmy crafts a story about the fight between Juani and Gina, and Juani hides behind his story and refuses to take responsibility for her actions. Finally, even though Jimmy's repeated abuse of Caridad is condemned in the family, no one speaks out against it. Throughout the novel, the Casas family members refuse to speak out against the different forms of violence occurring and none of the characters question when or how it will stop. In the final twenty pages of the novel, there is a scene of violence so reprehensible that the Casas family must finally acknowledge its occurrence. When Juani's cousin Pauli is confronted by the father of Rosa, her illegitimate child, Juani and Jimmy are left alone in the house with Rosa. Juani falls asleep and in a moment of narrative rupture, wakes up to witness Jimmy forcing baby Rosa to perform oral sex on him. Juani yanks Rosa off of Jimmy, just as most of the family bursts into the room and chaos breaks loose. Unlike the other highly private moments of sexualized violence in the novel, many members of the family witness this incident. It is though all of the repressed feelings and thoughts about past violent acts finally surface, as there is an explosion of sound: chains rattling, wood cracking as if in a fire (Obejas, 222). Ali, Rosa's father, hurls Jimmy around the room, and Pauli and Caridad begin to fight. The only people who stay out of the fight are Tia Celia, who comforts Rosa, and Juani, who is on the floor, worthless (Obejas, 223). Though Juani is the one to save Rosa, Jimmy's actions also implicate her. Jimmy stops the fighting by looking toward Juani begging her to tell them what really happened (Obejas, 224). When Juani is unable to speak, Jimmy turns on her yelling, I helped you, you stupid bitch, I helped you! (Obejas, 225), terrified and unsure what to do, Juani runs away. When Juani's cousin Patricia comes to find her, Juani is sitting in a coffee shop by herself doodling dots on a napkin, pretending it is a letter to their cousin Titi. Patricia tells Juani that everything will actually be okay, and Juani points to one of the dots on the napkin telling Patricia, This is the part where I tell Titi about what really happened with Gina (Obejas, 237). Jimmy's final act of violence is so unspeakable, that it finally breaks the silence surrounding the violence always present in the family. At the same time, Jimmy's act also forces Juani to speak up, because she does not want to hide behind the story that Jimmy crafted for her any longer. In Memory Mambo, the denied feelings of loss and displacement behind the different acts of violence are all exposed in Jimmy's final violent act. Though all of the characters in the novel have identities fractured in some ways by colonial stereotypes and exile, Juani and Jimmy arguably have the most difficulty defining their identities and feeling a sense of belonging. Juani and Jimmy are set up as doubles throughout the text; both have a propensity for control and both react violently toward their significant others. However, the end of the novel distinguishes Juani from Jimmy. With his horrific sexual abuse of Rosa, Jimmy continues the cycle of violence, while Juani chooses to try to stop it by speaking out, and telling the truth for once. In doing so, Juani begins to discover who she is and to come to terms with her feelings of loss and alienation. Juani begins the novel feeling lost and with little concept of her identity as a Cuban-American lesbian. Though Juani acts out in violence toward Gina, she also serves as an example for the rest of her family. The rest of the Casas family members have fractured identities and experiences feelings of loss and displacement, yet Juani experiences so many blatant contradictions in her identity, that she has great difficulty finding happiness for herself. While Juani's journey to finding herself does not necessarily offer a resolution to the pain and trauma of exile, it does offer the chance for a less painful future. Juani states: This is always my problem: These overwhelming feelings, this contained madness; to accept, for example, what just happened wit Gina, but without accepting it. What I mean is this: to accept enough, to accept so as to make everyday existence bearable&And then not to accepthow could I accept this madness? To accept it, I think, is to lose hope. I don't mean hope about us, but about me (Obejas, 233). In finding a way of accepting the disintegration of her relationship with Gina, without truly coming to terms with the violence in the relationship's conclusion, Juani offers a way for Cuban exiles and their children to adjust to life in America. Just as Juani must accept enough&to make everyday existence bearable (Obejas, 233), Cuban-Americans must learn to adapt to life in America, and hold less tightly to their traditions, without giving them up completely. Nena accomplishes this by putting distance between herself and her family, and finding love outside the Cuban community. Nena loves her family and refuses to forsake her identity as a Cuban, but she also learns to embrace her identity as a Cuban-American. Obejas thus demonstrates that though trauma associated with exile and post-colonial Cuba cannot be erased, there are many different ways to find happiness, or at the very least, to make everyday life less painful.

ENG.G0.26.2,Comparison of Hermia in A Midsummer Night's Dream and Jessica in TheMerchant of Venice,English,Argumentative Essay,"At first glance, Hermia of Midsummer Night's Dream and Jessica of Merchant of Venice appear to be similar characters. Both women run away from homes characterized by commanding fathers and absent mothers in order to marry their lovers. Patriarchy is blatantly defied in both situations, but Hermia and Jessica have very different relationships with their fathers and defy them to varying degrees. If the term defy is used in its most malignant context, it means, to renounce faith, allegiance, or affiance to (any one); to declare hostilities or war against (Oxford English Dictionary). By this definition, and assuming that more rebellion equals more success, Jessica is more successful in defying her father. This can be seen through Jessica's hostile relationship with her father, her renunciation of Judaism, and her cruel robbery of Shylock that includes trading his ring for a monkey. Jessica has a negative relationship with her father, Shylock, which Shakespeare never fully explains. In her second line of the play she declares, Our house is hell (II.iii.2, Merchant). Before she even mentions Lorenzo, Jessica speaks of her father with distain. She goes on to say, Alack, what a heinous sin is it in me/ To be ashamed to be my father's child! But though I am a daughter to his blood,/ I am not to his manners (II.iii.16-19, Merchant). Jessica openly states that she is ashamed to be Shylock's daughter, and though she admits that her feelings are sinful, she does not show any signs of guilt or remorse. She takes comfort that she is not like her father, but she never elaborates on what she finds distasteful in his character. A fair assumption may be that she is unhappy about being born a Jew and that she resents her father for passing on Judaism to her. Jessica loves a Christian man and plans to convert so she can marry him: I shall end this strife,/ Become a Christian and thy loving wife (II.iii.20-21, Merchant). One definition of defy is to renounce faith [to], which Jessica does both in terms of faith as loyalty to her father, as well as faith in a religious sense. Hermia, on the other hand, does not insult her father Egeus's character or oppose him beyond his choice for her husband. His favor for Demetrius appears arbitrary and he lacks a valid argument against Lysander's character, family, or wealth. This portrays Hermia's defiance as less severe and more sympathetic than Jessica's. In the first scene of A Midsummer Night's Dream, Hermia pleads with her father to let her marry Lysander instead of Demetrius. She boldly tells the duke, I would my father look'd but with my eyes (I.i.56, Midsummer). She would rather have her father's blessing than rebel against him, but she feels entitled to a choice in which man she marries. Conversely, Jessica never gives her father the chance to disapprove of her lover. She prepares to run away with Lorenzo in secret, commanding Launcelot to, give him this letter, do it secretly& I would not have my father/ See me in talk with thee (II.iii.7-9, Merchant). Both women speak of their father's sight, but with opposite hopes. Hermia wishes her father would relent and see from her perspective, while Jessica hopes her father remains blind to her scheme to run away. Hermia is ultimately unsuccessful at changing her father's view as the last thing Egeus says in the play is: I beg the law, the law, upon his head. /They would have stol'n away& Demetrius, Thereby to have defeated you and me:/ You of your wife, and me of my consent (IV.i.155-158, Midsummer). Egeus never gives his consent for Hermia and Lysander to marry; it is Theseus who overrules Egeus and gives the lovers his blessing. Jessica, however, is successful at running away with Lorenzo without Shylock discerning her plan. Ironically, Shylock asks Jessica to take care of his house while he is away, Jessica, my girl,/ Look to my house& Lock up my doors& Let not the sound of fopp'ry enter/ My sober house (II.v.15-36, Merchant). Not only does Jessica disregard her father's orders (as she does earlier when he tries to call her) but she robs the house of its treasures, including a casket of jewels and Shylock's wedding ring. When Tubal informs him that the ring was traded for a monkey, Shylock bursts into hysterics: Out upon her! Thou torturest me, Tubal. It was my turkis, I had it of Leah when I was a bachelor. I would not have given it for a wilderness of monkeys (III.i.120-124, Merchant). Shylock is sympathetic here, especially as the importance of wedding rings becomes integral in Act V when Portia and Nerissa berate their husbands for giving their rings away. Jessica's careless dispense of the ring goes beyond defiant to cruel and vindictive. Hermia, on the other hand, steals only herself from her father's house. She never inflicts the kind of pain on Egeus that Jessica inflicts on Shylock. If success in defying one's father is measured by the degree of hostility, Jessica certainly achieves more success than Hermia. However, at the end of the plays, Jessica's marriage seems doomed and Hermia's appears successful. When Hermia and Lysander enter after the wedding ceremony, Theseus says, Here come the lovers, full of joy and mirth (V.i.27, Midsummer). Little else is said about the couple, but there is no reason to think they will be unhappy. Conversely, the scene between Jessica and Lorenzo at the end of The Merchant of Venice does not bode well for their future. First, they compare themselves to famous lovers whose stories end unhappily. Then Jessica says, Did young Lorenzo swear he lov'd her well,/ Stealing her soul with many vows of faith,/ And ne'er a true one (V.i.17-19, Merchant) and Lorenzo replies, Did pretty Jessica (like a little shrow)/ Slander her love& (V.i.21-22, Merchant). This may hide in the guise of playful romantic banter, but Jessica's accusation of false vows, and Lorenzo calling his wife a shrow (meaning shrew) has a serious undertone. Later in the scene the lovers seem to be disconnected and lacking communication. The musicians enter and Jessica says: I am never merry when I hear sweet music (V.i.69, Merchant). Lorenzo replies in a long speech that ends with: The man that hath no music in himself,/ Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds,/ is fit for treason, stratagems, and spoils& Let no such man be trusted (V.i.83-88, Merchant). The man Lorenzo speaks of is not literally male, but mankind in an all encompassing sense. He does not seem to notice that this grave accusation of treason and untrustworthiness applies to his new wife, who has just said she is unmoved by music. The fact that Jessica's last line of the play includes I am never merry gives weight to the feeling that the lovers are not going to live happily ever after. It gives the reader cause to question how much Jessica and Lorenzo loved each other in the first place. Jessica may have seen Lorenzo as an opportunity to escape her father and convert to Christianity. Running away and renouncing her faith are never portrayed as a sacrifice or risk for Jessica. Rather, she eagerly betrays her father in a manner that could be construed as careless and hasty. At the end of The Merchant of Venice Jessica reaps the consequences of betraying her father and her faith, as Portia and the other Christians are unwelcoming. This outsider status could possibly symbolize a future exclusion from Heaven for Jessica. After her escape, Shylock declares, She is damned for it (III.i.31, Merchant), meaning that he believes Jessica is going to Hell for running away from him and becoming a Christian. Lancelot also thinks Jessica will be barred from Heaven as he tells her, the sins of the father are to be laid upon the children& for truly I think you are damn'd (III.v.1-6, Merchant). Lancelot does not blame Jessica's sins for her damnation, but rather her father's. However, it remains ambiguous whether Shylock was serious about taking a pound of Antonio's flesh until he learned of Jessica's flight. Her actions were the last straw for him, and after declaring his daughter damned, he gives his famous speech: To bait a fish withal- if it will feed nothing else, it will feed my revenge& Hath not a Jew eyes? (III.i.53-59). Therefore, it's possible that if Jessica had not defied her father, he may have had a change of heart, consequently, alleviating sin from herself. This may be farfetched, but at the end of the play, Jessica remains an outsider. Despite her efforts, she is more like her father than ever, as they are both Christian converts that risk never being accepted by Jews, Christians, and possibly even God. When examined in this light, Jessica's defiance against Shylock has gone terribly wrong. After close inspection of Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream and A Merchant of Venice it becomes clear that both Jessica and Hermia are successful at defying their fathers in different ways. If successful defiance is measured by greater rebellion and cruelty, Jessica certainly wins. However, if the daughter's happiness at the end of each play is a better measure for successful defiance, then Hermia's less severe approach achieves more. Ultimately, if success is to be associated with happiness and not the degree of defiance, one must conclude that less is more.

ENG.G0.27.1,The Representation of Jesus and Women in the Gospel of Mark,English,Argumentative Essay,"The Gospel of Mark offers valuable insight into the status and role of women in the early Jesus movement. Not only are there are several stories of Jesus interacting with women in this synoptic gospel, but also there are many moments in Mark where the reader witnesses Jesus speaking to women's issues. These instances of female inclusion in Jesus' sermons, as well as his purposeful involvement of women in his miracles, leave the reader with the strong sense that Jesus is mindful of the plight of women. The reader also observes women being faithful to Jesus in Mark, despite none of them holding the position of disciple, suggesting they too play a vital role in the story of Jesus. The final chapter in the Gospel that describes women fleeing in terror from Jesus' tomb, however, leaves open questions about the positive influence of women in the early Jesus movement. Looking closely at the words Jesus speaks concerning women's issues and briefly at the story of the hemorrhaging woman in Mark 5, it can be determined that the Gospel of Mark purposely gives weight to the exchanges between Jesus and women to enhance its social justice theme as well as gives due importance to the role of women in the Jesus story, while still holding slight reservations about the real nature of Jesus' female followers. Looking at the Gospel of Mark from a broad, thematic lens, a few specific subject matters emerge that distinguish Mark from the rest of the gospels. Specifically, it is marked by the frequent application of conflict to challenge the Jewish people's faith, as well as makes statements about the interconnectivity of sociopolitical and religious laws, which hints at a social justice theme. The introduction to the Gospel confirms this saying, [I]n this story religion is inseparable from the social, political, economic, even physiological aspects of life (Coogan 56). In a way, the stories and words of Jesus included in the Mark serve to emphasize the importance of social justice in God's will. The introduction mentions that in Mark, Jesus' challenges of the peoples' faith are constantly misunderstood, even surprisingly by his chosen disciples. However, as the introduction also reads, By contrast with the misunderstanding and faithless disciples, women, who play an increasingly prominent role in Mark's story, serve as models of faithfulness & (Coogan 56). Indeed, women are featured in many stories in this gospel, and, more importantly, are included in many of Jesus' sermons to the Jewish people about religious laws and social responsibilities. While women had been included in sermons and laws prior to the time of Jesus as well as in the other gospels, the Gospel of Mark seems to purposefully highlight women, enhancing this notion of the emphasis on social justice in the Gospel. Looking at specific examples of this social justice theme in Jesus' instructions to the Jewish people and other religious people, there is a fair amount concerning the equal rights of women. The reader first sees this in Mark 10, when the Pharisees and disciples ask him separately about the right of men to divorce their wives. First, to the Pharisees, Jesus quotes what Moses commanded them saying, 'God made them male and female.' & 'The two shall become one flesh.' So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate. Clarifying this point, he tells the disciples, Whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her; and if she divorces her husband and marries another, she commits adultery (vv. 6-12). Thus, Jesus is witnessed giving equal weight to men's and women's actions in divorce. This passage suggests that he sees women as holding equal status to men in the eyes of God, which is an important statement concerning the status of women. The inclusion of Jesus' words to disciples in addition to his words to the Pharisees shows that the author of the Gospel of Mark wanted to emphasize this position that Jesus takes. Another instance in the Gospel of Mark where the reader witnesses Jesus making a point about the equality of women is in Mark 12. In this chapter, Jesus responds to the Sadducees' concerns of Levirate marriages. They offer Jesus the example of a woman who has married seven brothers out of the conditions of Levirate marriages, and upon her death, still has not bore a child. They ask Jesus whose wife she will be in resurrection. Jesus answers with, For when they rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven (vv. 18-23). While it is not immediately obvious that this discussion between the Sadducees and Jesus concerns the equality of women, especially since Jesusor the author of the Gospeldid not use the opportunity to condemn Levirate marriage, upon close inspection it appears that Jesus is making the statement that women are free from spousal obligation in death. Jesus is seemingly arguing that men and women are equal in the eyes of God, so women should no longer be a men's possession when they enter God's kingdom. Other references concerning the importance of female justice in Jesus' instructions are made throughout the Gospels. Even references as subtle as that in Mark 13, reading, Woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing infant in those days! Pray this it may not be in winter (v. 17), still make the point in the Gospel that Jesus was mindful of women's concerns and poised to include both men and women in his sermons. In addition to Jesus' words on women, there seems to be a steady inclusion of women characters in the Gospel of Mark, stressing Jesus' desire to include all people in his miracles. A story in the Gospel that serves as good examples of Jesus wanting to include women in his healing power and treat women with kindness is the story of the hemorrhaging woman who touched an unsuspecting Jesus in Mark 5. The woman, who had been bleeding for 12 years, touches Jesus cloak while in a crowd, knowing its healing power. Jesus instantly feels her touch and asks who did it. Instead of slipping away unnoticed, the woman fesses up: But the woman, knowing what had happened to her, came in fear and trembling, fell down before him, and told him the whole truth (v. 33). Instead of rebuking the woman, Jesus blesses her and continues on with his healing. He says to her, Daughter, your faith has made you well; go in peace, and be healed of you disease (v. 34). This story is important because it shows a seemingly unclean woman taking control of her own healing. As the footnotes read, The initiative and actions are entirely [the woman's], Jesus being a passive conduit through which the healing power goes forth (Coogan 66). This not only shows female empowerment, but also it shows that Jesus is respectful of the woman's bold actions. Undoubtedly, this story was included in Mark to show that Jesus was willing to share his miracles with woman and also was accepting of female authority, making a general statement about the equality of women in his eyes. Jesus' recognition of women and the empowering action of women is repeated in Mark 14, when a female prophet anoints Jesus. While others scolded the woman for wasting ointment, Jesus is grateful. He says, She has done what she could & Truly I tell you, wherever the good news is proclaimed in the whole world, what she has done will be told in remembrance of her (vv. 8-9). Jesus accepts the woman's deed and emphasizes that she is showing devotions, something many of the disciples struggle to do. This woman is representative of many women who served Jesus out of their faith and contributed to the Jesus movement. She and the hemorrhaging woman are likely included in Mark's story of Jesus because they are influential females willing to do anything for Jesus, advancing the theme in this Gospel of the positive role of women and their steadfast devotion to God. This positive aura of women in Mark, however, is obfuscated by the end of the Gospel. Starting Mark 16, after the crucifixion and burial of Jesus, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to Jesus' tomb to anoint him (which again emphasizes the devotion and faithfulness of women in the story). However, when these women find the tomb opened and a man in a white garment tells them that Jesus has been raised, they are alarmed. The man says, But go, tell disciples and Peter that he is going ahead of you to Galilee; there you will see him, just as he told you (v. 7). The women's response, however, was not continued devotion and trust, rather it was terror. The text reads, So they went out and fled from the tomb, for terror and amazement has seized them; and they said nothing to anyone, for they were afraid (v. 8). While the statement they said nothing to anyone is contradicted in the two alternate endings, with, All that had been commanded them they told briefly to those around Peter, and [Mary Magdalene] went out and told those who had been with him, the statement still gives off an aura of the women recanting their faithfulness to Jesus and God. The women's fear and initial silence suggest that they are not the ceaselessly devoted followers that previous statements in Mark suggest. Juxtaposing this ending of Mark with the ending of the Gospel of Matthew, which portrays the women's reactions to finding Jesus missing from the tomb in a much different light, it is clear that Mark is trying to make a point about the role of women with the words the author chooses in Mark 16. The Gospel of Matthew describes a situation similar to that in Mark, saying that an angel appeared to Mary Magdalene and the other Mary at the empty tomb, who instructed the women to tell the disciples that Jesus has been raised from the dead. The reaction of the women is recorded in Matthew as, So they left the tomb quickly with fear and great joy, and ran to tell his disciples. Suddenly Jesus met them and said, 'Greetings!' And they came to him, took hold of his feet, and worshipped him (28: 8-9). So in Matthew, the women were still afraid of the empty tomb, but their joy and faith in Jesus allow them to ignore their terror and run to the disciples and worship Jesus. This is in great contrast to the fearful and concerned responses of the women in Mark, and it suggests that the Gospel of Mark is still questionable about the devotion of women to Jesus despite implying throughout the Gospel that women were devoted followers of Jesus. This is briefly mentioned in the introduction of the Gospel, which reads, [W]omen & serve as models of faithfulness until they flee from the empty tomb (Coogan 56). So, just like the men in the story of Mark, women too have lapses in their faith and question their devotion to Jesus, just as Peter did when he denied being Jesus' disciple. Thus, this abrupt and confusing ending to the Gospel of Mark disrupts readers' impressions of women formed throughout the story. The ending leaves a lot of room for interpretation concerning the influence of women in the story of Jesus and shows that the author of the Gospel still has reservations about the inclusion of women in Jesus' discipleship. It is important to note that aside from these separate endings to Mark and Matthew concerning the role of women in telling the disciples about the rising of Jesus, similar passages concerning Jesus' interactions with women and views on gender equality can be found in Matthew. Specifically, his instructions to the Pharisees and disciples concerning divorce, as mentioned earlier, are close to those in Matthew 19. Also, the stories of the hemorrhaging woman and the female prophet are seen in Matthew and Luke. So it would be wrong to assert that the importance Jesus gives to women's issues and his positive interactions with women are specific to Mark, as they are echoed in the other synoptic gospels. In fact, it is arguable that the Gospel of Luke includes more references to women and statements about female justice than Mark does, especially looking at the story of the widowed woman arguing with an unjust judge in Luke 18 and Jesus' address to wailing women as the base of his cross in Luke 23. Nevertheless, women are influential in Mark, especially serving as positive members of Jesus' following and being a main talking point in Jesus' sermons on social justice. Thus, the inclusion of women in Mark may not be unique to the Gospel, but the role of women is still noteworthy and important to Mark's story of Jesus. And what is arguably most important about the role of women in Mark's Gospel is the fact even after having steadfast devotion to Jesus throughout the story, women close to Jesus were still afraid of him and doubted their faith at the end. While it may never be known why the end of the Gospel of Mark was written the way it was, it can be said with assurance that women are viewed as equals to men in the Gospel, both in the eyes of Jesus as well as in their potential to question God's will and their faith.

ENG.G0.28.1,Bloom the Critic in Joyce's Ulysses,English,Argumentative Essay,"When Odysseus finally reaches Ithaca at the end of The Odyssey, he reclaims his home from the usurping suitors by deceiving them, massacring them, and slaughtering any servant who has served them. When Leopold Bloom finally returns home in Ithaca, he crawls into bed, kisses his unfaithful wife's bottom, and falls asleep. Allowing Bloom's journey to end with such a thud, Joyce relies on the reader's horror towards the violence and ruthlessness that cap The Odyssey to make Bloom's reconciliatory conclusion seem preferable, if comparatively uneventful. The carnage of Odysseus' return provokes an excitement and disgust of a far more climactic nature than the sentimental satisfaction of Bloom's commitment to Molly and dedication to the damaged marriage, but at least Bloom creates no corpses. Though the conclusion of Ulysses generally affirms Bloom, Molly, and their marriage, one of the sacrifices that this affirmation entails is that the reader must also embrace routine and dullness. Bloom serves not as epic strategist, but rather as epic critic: his strength lies not in his ability to defeat his enemies with cunning and deceit, but to interpret and reinterpret his situation in order to come to terms with it. As a result, he acts with equanimity rather than wrath; with generosity rather than hatredand while the book positions us to celebrate Bloom for these traits, it also forces us to confront the humdrum status quo that these traits buttress and encourage. As both the day and Ulysses slouch towards completion in the last few pages of Ithaca, Bloom proceeds through four antagonistic sentimentsenvy, jealousy, abnegation, and equanimitybefore he can climb into bed next to Molly and fall asleep (602). He endures this task at least in part because of his ability to see Molly's adultery in the broader framework of more serious crimes: As less reprehensible than theft, highway robbery, cruelty to children and animals, obtaining money under false pretences, forgery, embezzlement, misappropriation of public money, betrayal of public trust, malingering, mayhem, corruption of minors, criminal libel, blackmail, contempt of court, arson, treason, felony, mutiny on the high seas, trespass, burglary, jailbreaking, practice of unnatural vice, desertion from armed forces in the field, perjury, poaching, usury, intelligence with the king's enemies, impersonation, criminal assault, manslaughter, wilful and premeditated murder (603). In the most immediate sense, this list of crimes is the site where Bloom begins to enable himself to stay with Molly, and it therefore prepares him for the reconciliation that serves as the climax of the novel. After spending the day wandering the streets to avoid having to confront the pain of his wife's infidelity, Bloom makes considerable progress here by coming to terms with the state of his marriage and realizing that Molly's act is not so heinous. But while the list functions at one level simply to contextualize Molly's deed, it also perpetuates itself for nine lines of text such that, in all of its excess, it mocks contextualization by illustrating the tedium of the process. Bloom has no need to actually compare adultery to every crime from poaching to mutiny on the high seasthe idea that Molly sleeping with Boylan is not so bad becomes evident after only a few examples. But by iterating the list in all its flabbiness, the book demonstrates both the potential dullness of considering alternatives and also the manner in which Bloom's contextualization stymies action. Simply due to its volume, the list serves in part as a grand punctuation mark: it prevents the narrative from progressing as it requires the reader to take note of crime after crime after crime. So while the list is necessary to the narrative in terms of its role in allowing Bloom to return to bed, it also contributes to the depiction of Bloom's requisite dullness through both its redundancy and its length. The list of crimes and the sections that proceed from it also provide an opportunity to investigate Bloom's role as critic: for Bloom does not react to Molly's adultery so much as he reinterprets it. In order to reach a state of equanimity, Bloom must come to the realization that the deed is As more than inevitable, irreparable (603); whether he murder Boylan, divorce Molly, or simply leave in the middle of the night, Molly's adultery is already in the past. The act itself is now inalterable, which is a fact that presides over Bloom's consideration of retribution: Assassination, never, as two wrongs did not make one right. Duel by combat, no. Divorce, not now. Exposure by mechanical artifice (automatic be) or individual testimony (concealed ocular witnesses), not yet (603). As Bloom considers his options for vengeance, his first deterrent is the futility of violence; two wrongs did not make one right not only expresses Bloom's moral convictions but also evinces his forward-looking mentality. Whereas Odysseus enacts his vengeance upon the suitors for usurping his house in his absence and finds himself with a mound of corpses, Bloom dismisses such an opportunity after a momentary reflection on its immorality and uselessness. As Bloom's mind proceeds through possible reactions to Molly's infidelity, he begins to found his justifications for inaction less upon ethics than upon laziness. By the time he considers duel by combat, he does not even offer the type of simplistic moral cliche that he uses to reject assassination; he responds only with a swift no. Bloom's answers to possible forms of retribution continue in like form and start to suggest a blunt unwillingness to act at the moment as he says, not now and not yet. Once again, Bloom does not live up to his exciting predecessor Odysseus as he languorously chooses to delay his reaction. The reader sympathizes with Bloom for being listless after spending the day walking all over Dublin, but at a certain point, Bloom seems willing to climb into bed with Molly simply because he is tired and wants to go to sleep. Although succumbing to sleepiness humanizes Bloom, it also serves as a relatively unremarkable climax for Joyce's modern epic. Joyce provides significant reasons for Bloom to get into bed with Molly, but he forces us to acknowledge some unsatisfying ones as well. The end of the novel does not see the marriage completely fixed, and though we are glad that the marriage begins to look hopeful, we have to temper those hopes with the knowledge that the book only lasts one day and that Bloom and Molly have work left to do. Bloom accepts that he cannot prevent or avoid Molly's adultery, but he also understands that he can change the way that he perceives her infidelity with his knack for interpretation. In his Philosophical Investigations, Ludwig Wittgenstein provides a model that helps conceptualize Bloom's ability to transform his relationship to Molly. As he explores the relationship between interpretation and perception, Wittgenstein writes: This triangle Figure here can be seen as a triangular hole, as a solid, as a geometrical drawing; as standing on its base, as hanging from its apex; as a mountain, as a wedge, as an arrow or pointer, as an overturned object which is meant to stand on the shorter side of the right angle, as a half parallelogram, and as various other things (200). By adding so many examples where one or two would suffice, Wittgenstein demonstrates the illimitable potential of interpretation to alter not the triangle itself but what the triangle can be seen as. The same basic tenets hold true for Bloom: though he cannot prevent Molly from sleeping with Boylan, he can mentally transform the event by surrounding it with different narratives and explanations. Bloom displays his ability to enact such transformations as he justifies to himself his sentiments (Joyce 604). Early in this justification, Bloom reflects upon the incongruity and disproportion between the selfprolonging tension of the thing proposed to be done and the selfabbreviating relaxation of the thing done (604). Beyond reluctantly accepting that Molly's adultery is irreparable, Bloom recognizes that he actually benefits from this fact because he no longer has to bear the tense anticipation of four o'clock. The type of reversal that Bloom achieves herethat he ought to appreciate that Molly has slept with Boylandemonstrates the extent of his power to reshape his perception of the original occurrence. Though he remains helpless to change what happened, the significance of that helplessness diminishes as Bloom proves himself capable of the more important task of altering the future by reinterpreting the past. As the justification continues, Bloom actively takes his efforts to a linguistic level such that Wittgenstein's commentsoriginating upon a discussion of languagebecome increasingly pertinent: the natural grammatical transition by inversion involving no alteration of sense of an aorist preterite proposition (parsed as masculine subject, monosyllabic onomatopoeic transitive verb with direct feminine object) from the active voice into its correlative aorist preterite proposition (parsed as feminine subject, auxiliary verb and quasimonosyllabic onomatopoeic past participle with complementary masculine agent) in the passive voice (604). Hidden beneath the jargon suited to the faux scientific voice of the chapter lies a language game in which Bloom toys with grammar to better cope with the idea of Boylan and Molly having sex. At stake in Bloom's meddling is his perception of Molly's agency in the act of adultery: switching Molly's grammatical position in the bedroom into the passive voice allows Bloom to entertain the idea that she may have been compliant rather than active. She may even be a victim. But though the substance of Bloom's reflection may have little or nothing to do with onomatopoeia or aorist preterite situations, the book brings issues of language to the forefront with its technical diction. In one sense, Bloom literally surrounds Molly's adultery with two explanations just like those that Wittgenstein surrounds his triangle with: presumably, he f*cked her and she was f*cked by him. By generating these explications, Bloom enables himself to temper his insecurities about the extent of Molly's faithlessness. To use the language of Wittgenstein, we might say that Bloom can see the infidelity as both an active and a passive act just as we could see the triangle as both a mountain and a wedge. And while the literal reinterpretation of Molly as passive agent in the affair directly helps Bloom, the freedom that these mental movements allow help him indirectly. For while Odysseus utilizes the type of linear thinking of honor and possession that leads to revenge and massacre, Bloom saves himself from such restrictive perspectives and violent actions by finding multiple ways to interpret Molly's sexual encounter with Boylan. Bloom's final few reflections further clarify his rejection of the Odysseus response: the futility of triumph or protest or vindication: the inanity of extolled virtue: the lethargy of nescient matter: the apathy of the stars (604). In the first two reflections, Bloom openly recognizes the uselessness of the triumph and virtue that justify Odysseus' violence at the conclusion of Homer's epic. These notions are too simple for Bloom, who dismisses them to think instead about Molly's infidelity at a theoretical, scientific level. In a show of interpretive creativity beyond the scope of Odysseus, Bloom thinks about how the nescient matter of which Molly and Boylan's bodies are composed does not care what happened between them. Finally, Bloom concludes by expanding the sphere of his consideration from the body of his wife to the apathy of the stars. The realization that at a grand, cosmic level his wife's infidelity does not signify anything helps Bloom come to terms with the act, but even Bloom's willingness to think on such a broad scale proves that his mind does not imprison itself within the trauma it confronts. So while the corpses of slaughtered suitors and unfaithful attendants mark the conclusion of Odysseus' journey to reclaim his home, Bloom completes his epic journey through Dublin by kissing his unfaithful wife on the behind and falling asleep. This relatively unremarkable ending results in part from the different roles that the characters play throughout their respective epics: Odysseus the epic strategist and Bloom the epic critic. But even though the prospect of admiring Bloom's effort to reconcile with Molly necessitates a certain willingness to tolerate and even embrace dullness, dullness is much to be preferred to slaughter. The ability to interpret functions in the late scenes of Ithaca as a potentially unifying forcea force that prevents the violence of The Odyssey. And in the years between 1914 and 1921 when Joyce writes Ulysses and Europe simultaneously tears itself apart in the gruesome First World War, Bloom's equanimity provides a new and appreciable trait for the modern hero.

ENG.G0.29.1,Good People Breaking Rules,English,Argumentative Essay,"The Oxford English Dictionary defines Etiquette as, [t]he conventional rules of personal behaviour observed in the intercourse of polite society; the ceremonial observances prescribed by such rules (1.c). The purpose of these rules is to allow people to understand the quality of the person with whom they are interacting. By establishing hard and fast rules for interaction, a society is able to weed out the bad apples. At least that is the goal. In Pride and Prejudice as well as in Evelina, an important distinction is necessitated between those who understand and practice etiquette and those who are truly polite and good-natured. Both of these novels show that the practice of etiquette alone cannot serve as an indicator of personal value. Evelina understands very little of the rules of polite society. When she attends the dance and is pestered into dancing with Willoughby, she violates the rules by telling him that she had been previously engaged to dance when in reality she had not. When she is caught in her lie, she becomes flustered and unable to speak. This is evident in the addition of the dash into all of her spoken sentences. I hope not,-- I beg thatI would not for the worldI am sure I ought toto (Burney, 47). These dashes are used to show the vocal breaks that she is making in the dialogue and to show her confused and distracted state of mind. The reason for her agitation is that Willoughby has just alerted Orville to the fact that Evelina has made it seem that she was engaged to dance with Orville during the night. Being caught in this lie, Evelina is trying in vain to find some way to get herself out of the situation. Her intention was simply to avoid dancing with Willoughby and in her attempts to let him down easy, she began to break the rules laid out by etiquette, and once this breech in the rules of the dance was made, Willoughby knew that he had leverage to manipulate her. Evelina in this instance has no rude or insolent motivation. She simply does not want to dance with Willoughby. Yet, because of the rules of decorum, she ends up looking like a peevish girl who is trying to insult a man that wants to dance with her. Willoughby serves as wonderful counterpoint to Evelina in this scene. He performs all the necessary forms and deference to Evelina in seeking her hand for the dance, yet does so in a way that makes it clear that he is a rude and insolent man. Evelina writes to Villars, The moment we had gone down the dance, I was hastening away from him, but he stopt me, and said that I could by no means return to my party, without giving offence, before we had done our duty of walking up the dance. As I know nothing at all of these rules and customs, I was obliged to submit to his directions; but I fancy I looked rather uneasy, for he took notice of my inattention, saying, in his free way, ""Whence that anxiety?Why are those lovely eyes perpetually averted?"" (Burney, 44) Willoughby here is leaning hard on the rules to keep Evelina within reach of himself. It is clear that Evelina no longer wishes to be near him yet he pursues her still, and does so by telling her that she would give offense if she were to leave him. It is interesting that Willoughby takes no ownership over the offense. His words are not that he would be offended or that it would hurt his feelings, but that she can't leave without giving offense. To whom? How? Why? These things don't matter, the rules aren't personal for Willoughby; they are simply a means for gaining his desires. He is requiring her to submit to an anonymous set of rules that she does not understand. This anonymity is the grand failure of etiquette. Whereas a person is supposed to demonstrate their better qualities through their understanding and application of the rules of society, Willoughby is highlighting his failings. Highlighting his pride, vanity, and selfishness. Etiquette does not require someone to be concerned for the feelings of others but rather in this instance allows Willoughby to insulate himself from Evelina's feelings by forcing her to follow the rules. Lord Orville complicates this understanding of the failure of etiquette. He holds himself to all of the highest requirements of polite society and is still able to be a good and amiable person. He shows that the excellent performance of etiquette is not a signifier of a person with no redeeming qualities. There must be a distinction drawn between two types of people here: Those who are able to follow the forms and those who are actually polite. It is clear that Willoughby is able to follow the forms, yet he is not polite. Evelina desires to be polite and is good-natured, yet she has not been taught the forms by which she should act. Orville is the pinnacle of both. He is able to observe the correct ways of acting, and he is also truly polite. This is seen again in the dance scene. When Willoughby is trying to embarrass Evelina in front of him, Orville refuses to expose her as ridiculous. When Willoughby passes her hand to Orville in a way that should make her actions obvious, Orville plays dumb, 'You do me too much honour, Sir,' cried [Orville], (with an air of gallantry, pressing it to his lips before he let it go) 'however, I shall be happy to profit by it' (Burney, 47). And then later when Willoughby is away, Orville says to Evelina, Be not distressed, I beseech you; I shall ever think my name honoured by your making use of it (Burney, 48). Orville's good nature shows itself in his detachment from the rules of etiquette. While observing them most stridently himself, he does not look down on those who do not follow them. Instead, he is gracious when Evelina is in distress and is glad that his name has been of some use is helping her get out of her situation. In Pride and Prejudice this same point is made clear. Etiquette is not an accurate identifier of quality within a person, yet here, instead of value being given to characters simply because of their good nature, value is given for those who think freely. The best example of this is Elizabeth. Almost all of her social interactions include some mode of bending the rules or decorum. In her interactions with Lady Catherine, she refuses to act the way that an inferior should act in regard to someone of superior rank. When she visits Rosings, Elizabeth answers most of Lady Catherine's questions openly but when asked for her age Elizabeth refuses at first to answer. She does eventually reveal that she is not yet one and twenty (Austen, 162). When they meet again at Longbourn, Elizabeth again refuses to give in to her demands. After Lady Catherine asks if she is resolved to marry Darcy, Elizabeth says, I am only resolved to act in that manner, which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without reference to you, or to any person so wholly unconnected to me (Austen, 338). Elizabeth is valued for her determination to secure her own happiness in a way that would maintain her individualism and this is one of the shining moments when she declares that desire. On the opposite end of the etiquette spectrum in Pride and Prejudice is Mr. Collins. He is made all of obedience and following the rules of personal engagement. Collins is made all the more ridiculous by the fact that he alerts people to the fact that he is obeying the proper forms. When is ready to leave Longbourn and return home, he says to Mr. Bennet, Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention; and depend on it, you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this (Austen, 122). It is, of course very polite to send a letter of thanks to someone who has been kind to you, but it is very rare that you would tell someone that they should expect that letter to come soon. Collins is seen as ridiculous for this attention to manners, yet he is also seen as ridiculous in the way that he makes very important decisions to satisfy the wishes of other people. His third reason for marrying Elizabeth is that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness (Austen, 103). This particular advice, while serving as the third reason for his coming to Longbourn for a wife seems to be the most important and if not that, is definitely the catalyst. It was this advice that allowed Collins to obsequiously leave Rosings, and had not Lady Catherine sent him to go, he most definitely would not have left. In Evelina and Pride and Prejudice systems of etiquette are held to in a rigid fashion, and in dong so they become inaccurate measures of personal worth. These rules for measuring people seem to always fail because they attempt to make very divergent personalities uniform. Etiquette isn't going anywhere though; we just have to remember that sometimes, good people break the rules.

ENG.G0.32.1,"Slavery in ""Robinson Crusoe""",English,Argumentative Essay,"Slavery has long been both the subject of writings and a topic of debate for hundreds of years; while the actual merits behind slavery have been hotly contested, the fact remains that slavery has proved itself to be an imperative historical topic that reaches a wide audience. The novel Robinson Crusoe, by Daniel Defoe, centers on a man who becomes stranded on an island, which becomes his own domain. Most of the novel takes place with Crusoe alone on the island, but his entire way of life is altered when the author introduces a cannibal into the novel, which Crusoe quickly brands as his slave. Based on various criticisms of the novel, it is widely debated whether the character of Robinson Crusoe (and, in effect, Daniel Defoe himself) supported the use of slavery. Throughout the novel, Crusoe treats his servant with respect, even admitting to the reader that he loves him, which showcases a rare admission of respect for a lower class. However, regardless of the treatment of his servants, Crusoe still employs the use of slaves, seemingly gaining pleasure from his supremacy over them. This, in turn, sheds light on the common European views at the time regarding colonialism: that many nations, including England, desired to forcefully colonize nations inhabited with natives in order to both spread their Christian morals and to gain more power through territorial acquisitions. The entrance of Crusoe's slave Friday into the novel shifts the novel from being about Crusoe's dominance over territory to being about his supremacy over a human, which also signifies the European desires to conquer uncharted lands and their natives. In order to gain a full perspective on Crusoe's view of slavery, the reader must closely examine his actions prior to his time stranded on the island. At the beginning of the novel, when Crusoe is actually forced into slavery himself, he effectively conveys his feelings on being enslaved; he feels that he suddenly changes from a Merchant into a miserable slave, (Defoe 15) already providing the reader with his hatred of being a slave. It's fairly obvious that Crusoe wants to be in a position of power; it's a completely different ideology for Crusoe himself to become a slave, and he makes his frustration extremely clear to the reader. Later, Crusoe meets Xury, an African boy with who he escapes the clutches of slavery. However, when both Crusoe and Xury find themselves on a Portuguese ship, the captain of the ship offers to buy Xury from Crusoe. Crusoe struggles with the decision, due to the boy's aid to him while they were both trapped as slaves earlier. Ultimately, Crusoe decides to sell his friend to the Portuguese man for personal gain: &he offer'd me also 60 pieces of Eight more for my Boy Xury, which I was loathe to take, not that I was not willing to let the Captain have him, but I was very loath to sell the poor Boy's Liberty&he would give the Boy an Obligation to set him free in ten Years, if he turn'd Christian; upon this, and Xury saying he was willing to go to him, I let the Captain have him (26). Here, Crusoe displays the real value that he places on slaves like Xury; though he has doubts about selling him, he eventually decides to sell the boy back into slavery, setting up a harsh and unforgiving future for the young boy. Crusoe justifies the sale by explaining that after ten years go by, the boy will be let free; ten years in slavery is an incredibly lengthy time period, and the boy surely must have agreed to the sale simply to please Crusoe. Additionally, the boy will be forced to convert to Christianity, which accurately depicts the European colonialist attitude at the time; the Europeans desire not only to enslave people but to also teach them the ways of the white man, essentially forcing their philosophies and beliefs on people who come from various backgrounds. The literary critic Ian Watt superbly conveys why Crusoe sold Xury into slavery: Crusoe treats his personal relationships in terms of their commodity value. The Moorish boy, Xury, for example, helps him to escape from slavery, and on another occasion offers to prove his devotion by sacrificing his own life. Crusoe very properly resolves 'to love him ever after,' and promises 'to make him a great man.' But when chance leads them to the Portuguese trader, and its captain offers Crusoe sixty pieces of eight  twice Judas' figure  he cannot resist the bargain and sells Xury into slavery&Remorse later supervenes, but only when the tasks of his island existence renew his need for a slave. (Watt 302) Watt describes the aspect of Crusoe's personality that lies at the heart of who he actually is: Crusoe views everything as a commodity, even people. His needs and wants are based on his ever-changing atmospheres; as Watt illustrates, Crusoe only shows guilt for selling Xury when he needs a slave on the island. Crusoe jumps at the chance to claim anything, and Xury is no exception; when Crusoe is offered money for his dear friend, he frets over the offer but ultimately accepts due to his want of material goods. In Crusoe's eyes, money outweighs the value of the life of Xury, so he sells him to a Portuguese trader he doesn't even know. Who knows what kind of experiences Xury will have to endure with the Portuguese? Furthermore, the Portuguese trader could easily renege on his deal and hold Xury captive for the rest of his life. In short, Crusoe pushes Xury into a life of uncertainty for extra money which he doesn't even need, simultaneously signifying his seemingly authoritarian dominance over slaves and his willingness to view people as commodities, meant to be traded or sold. It's clear throughout the novel that Crusoe badly desires his own slaves on the island that he lands on. He writes, Besides, I fancied myself to manage One, nay, Two or Three Savages, if I had them, so as to make them entirely Slaves to me, to do whatever I direct them, and to prevent their being able at any time to do me any hurt (145). Crusoe realizes that he needs manual labor to help him survive on the island, but more importantly, he desires his own slaves precisely because he wants to be in control. He has proclaimed the island to be his own; he repeatedly refers to places on the island as his, showcasing his inherently possessive nature. Later, when he discovers Friday, he details his encounter: &first I made him know his Name should be Friday&I likewise taught him to say Master (149). The mere fact that Crusoe brands his new acquaintance with his own name for him portrays the sense of superiority that Crusoe has over other races; he doesn't bother to inquire as to what the native's name is, but, like a teacher, instructs Friday to follow his decisions. Not only does Crusoe enforce his own sense of control over Friday, but he actually tells himself that Friday enjoys it: Friday is perfectly oblig'd and engag'd; his very Affections were ty'd to me, like those of a Child to a Father& (151). Friday undoubtedly is gracious for Crusoe's saving of his life, but his affection for Crusoe isn't like those of a Child to a Father at all; later in the novel, when Friday and Crusoe come across the father of Friday, Friday embraces him with more emotion than he ever shows Crusoe. Crusoe simply assumes that Friday is a willing servant because of Crusoe's act of saving him from death, when the deed was performed so that Crusoe could obtain a servant. Various examples of Crusoe's tone suggest that Crusoe thinks of Friday as a savage, of sorts. He calls Friday a poor Savage on multiple occasions (159, 172), truly revealing to the reader that he still has bigoted feelings towards his own servant. By branding Friday as a savage that he attempts to control, it's easier for Crusoe to turn him into his servant; he forces Friday to be his slave while justifying it by teaching him the ways of the Bible and Christian ethics. Essentially, Crusoe still feels some sense of ownership over Friday, a sense that revisits his personality on various occasions. Crusoe describes his island as solely his: My island was now peopled, and I thought my self very rich in Subjects; and it was a merry Reflection which I frequently made, How like a King I look'd...My people were perfectly subjected: I was absolute Lord and Lawgiver& (174). Here, Crusoe finally merges his notions of his own control over the island and his power over the people on his island, or rather, his subjects. He is Lord, and no one can strip him of the title, at least until he leaves the island. The presence of Friday (and, to an extent, the other cannibals) illustrates the state of mind of Crusoe during his tenure on the island; he takes his previous view of slaves as a commodity and applies it to his own dictatorship, forcing Friday to be his slave while justifying the slavery by saving Friday's life. He distinctly exerts his power and control over his island to expand over the island's inhabitants as well, portraying his true beliefs about slavery. Much like his description of the island (he writes of My cave on page 194), Friday is now his, bound by the constraints of both the circumstances in which he was obtained and by the governing rules that Crusoe has produced. The dominance of Crusoe over Friday also comes to represent the feelings that Europeans had at the time regarding slavery of other races. As James Joyce explains, The true symbol of the British conquest is Robinson Crusoe&he is the true prototype of the British colonist, as Friday&is the symbol of the subject races (323). Crusoe proves himself to be a Jack of All Trades type of character, adapting into most situations with ease and comfort; Friday is made out to be hopeless and lost. Crusoe saves him from danger, enslaves him and teaches him the Bible, which epitomizes the European colonialist action all around the world around the time in which the novel was written. The novel doesn't explicitly condone slavery, but it makes it seem that without it, society couldn't function properly. Additionally, if Friday is a symbol of the subject races, as Joyce proposes, his character probably serves to portray the savages, or rather, all the non-European races, as needing to be taught Christian ways. The issue of slavery in Robinson Crusoe can be interpreted in a variety of ways; Crusoe repeatedly desires to own his own slaves, and when he acquires them, he treats them with a level of respect. However, this respect constitutes of a feeling that other races are in need, and that they need to be enslaved for the good of both the Europeans and the non-Europeans. Crusoe is hesitant in treating his slaves badly, and he even confesses to loving one of them, but his opinion is clear: that without slavery, society cannot function in an efficient manner. By including the character of Friday in the novel, Defoe makes it possible for Crusoe not only to exert his power over territory but also enables him to assert his dominance over the other races that he encounters. Crusoe's possessiveness is never more prevalent; he yearns for power and grabs hold of it through his island and through his enslavement of Friday.

ENG.G0.34.1,The Law of Love,English,Argumentative Essay,"In the Gospel of Mark, Jesus redefines the family as whoever does the will of God the father, and his life and teaching throughout the gospel is presented as a gradual revelation of what that will is (Mk3:35). He shares with the religious authorities of the time the belief that this will is revealed in the commandmentsthat is, in torah. But he strongly contends with them on the authority of other traditions, especially concerning offerings and kosher rites. In line with the prophets, he argues that love towards God and others is the true meaning of torah, and God's true will as law-giver. Thus, one fulfills torahand so the will of Godnot by adhering to rituals (seen in this teaching as human traditions), but by fostering social justice out of love. It is, therefore, a matter of interpretation: Jesus differs from the authorities of the time in his belief about the tradition of the elders and its conformance with the will of Godwhich can only be a matter of interpretation for man. What is valuable then is simply coming to an understanding of his teaching, which his followers felt so strongly about as to break away from this tradition of the elders whom they so surely loved. Above all, he teaches a worship of God which is in and of the heart. This teaching is in line with such ideas as the circumcision of the heart in Deuteronomy1 and the prophets, and even with some of the Psalms2. In this, Christianity continues a movement already unfolding in Judaism3 towards a new idea of worshipand thus, of the community of worshipersbased on new ideas of purity and impurity. It teaches that all these things are in the human heart, and not in the body of tradition. To understand what this worship of the heart is, and what it means for the common identity, one need look further on into the Gospel of Mark, to chapter seven, where these ideas are laid out in the form of a story. During a dispute with some scribes and Pharisees, Jesus makes a distinction between what he sees as human traditionhere the kosher laws, laws of ritual purity and impurityand the true will of God as revealed in his commandments: Now when the Pharisees and some of the scribes who had come from Jerusalem gathered around him, they noticed that some of his disciples were eating with defiled hands, that is, without washing them [&] So the Pharisees and the scribes asked him, ""Why do your disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders, but eat with defiled hands?"" He said to them, ""Isaiah prophesied rightly about you hypocrites, as it is written, ""'This people honors me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me; in vain do they worship me, teaching human precepts as doctrines.'You abandon the commandment of God and hold to human tradition.""(Mk7: 1-2, 5-8) This view of some rituals is by no means new to Judaism; rather, Jesus' conflict with the authorities here picks up and echoes past conflicts between prophet and priest. Jesus himself openly shows the continuity between his teaching and the teaching of the prophets when he quotes Isaiah. Indeed, the Jesus movement seems a further unfolding of that begun by the prophets, a movement away from ritual and toward social justice as the means of fulfilling torah. As with the prophets, it is not an attack against the law itself; rather, it presents a refutation, from within Judaism, of a particular way of living torah which was around, and which Jesus and the fellow Jews who followed him saw and disagreed with. That is, fulfillment of the commandments out of a sense of legal obligation only, not out of any understanding of the morality contained within them. The scribes and the Pharisees then become the set type for this kind of legalistic worship, the negative way in which the Jewish authorities are presented in this story. The example he puts forth is of authorities who insist upon making offerings to God instead of using the goods to support one's parents in their old age: Then he said to them, ""You have a fine way of rejecting the commandment of God in order to keep your tradition! For Moses said, 'Honor your father and your mother'; and, 'Whoever speaks evil of father or mother must surely die.' But you say that if anyone tells father or mother, 'Whatever support you might have had from me is Corban' (that is, an offering to God)then you no longer permit doing anything for a father or mother, thus making void the word of God through your tradition that you have handed on."" (Mk7: 9-13) In this view, the commandments concerning right behavior towards one's fellow human beings are more important than those which govern ritual observance, and the two are even at odds sometimes. And in times like this, when carrying out the ritual commandments keeps one from carrying out the social and moral commandments, the latter override the former. It even seems thatby continually calling certain features of worship, such as kosher laws and laws of offering, human traditions/precepts, and setting them in opposition to the word/commandment of GodJesus is arguing that such ritual laws are not from God at all, but are human inventions or misunderstandings. If this is the case, even in this he is not without precedent in Judaism4. But it is not a denouncement or an abolition of the law; far from it. Rather, his charge is against [abandoning] the commandment of God, and [holding] to human tradition, and making void the word of God through your tradition that you have handed on (Mk7: 8, 13). He appeals to Moses (i.e. Torah) as a teaching come from God and not man, and thus authoritative above all other traditions. So it is at once an affirmation of the law as the will of God, and a warning not to give a human interpretation to the commandments such that they no longer bring forth the social justice which Jesus, in line with the prophets, teaches as the true will of God and the true meaning of his commandments. In this teaching, he urges all to look beyond simply the physical behavior towards others that the law commands, and to see what this reveals about how one is to look at others in the heart. Jesus, calling upon a voice from the past, urges those listening to shift the focus of their worship from ritual to moral; he appeals to the commandments on the basis of their morality, not simply their legality. In quoting the passage from Isaiah, Jesus sets in opposition to worship that is only with the lips the concept of a worship with the heart: This people honors me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me (Mk7:6). What is being condemned is an outer worship which does not proceed from an innersomething like going through the motions, perhaps. Such worship is condemned as empty, in vain, coming only from what is human and leading only to what is human, ungodly altogether (Mk7:7). All this leads up to one of the most profound messages in all the Christian writings, where Jesus lays out his own ideas about the heart as the place where torah is fulfilled, and purity achieved: Then he called the crowd again and said to them, ""Listen to me, all of you, and understand: there is nothing outside a person that by going in can defile, but the things that come out are what defile."" When he had left the crowd and entered the house, his disciples asked him about the parable. He said to them, ""Then do you also fail to understand? Do you not see that whatever goes into a person from outside cannot defile, since it enters, not the heart but the stomach, and goes out into the sewer?"" (Thus he declared all foods clean.) And he said, ""It is what comes out of a person that defiles. For it is from within, from the human heart, that evil intentions come: fornication, theft, murder, adultery, avarice, wickedness, deceit, licentiousness, envy, slander, pride, folly. All these evil things come from within, and they defile a person."" (Mk7:14-23) The immediate emphasis is on listening and understanding; the will to know, and the knowing itself. Answering the authorities' concern about his disciples' defiled hands, Jesus calls the crowd to come to a new understanding of purity and impurity as being not from the body, but from the heart. For the distinction here between heart and stomach seems not to be between the two as organs both of the body, but between the body and something else. That is to say, it seems that what is meant by the heart is not the heart in the chest. Rather, it seems the heart that is meant is the seat of the will, and the place of conscience (inner knowledge, or understanding.) For what is in the heart are intentions; and, consistent with Christian teaching elsewhere, it is not only physical acts of evil which defile a person, but even the willing thought in the heart5. The act is what comes forth from this thought in the heart; fornication, slander, etc. These are not just abstract thoughts, but real words and deeds which come from the will and the knowledge within. And these things alone, which are in and of the heart, make one pure or impure. So, he argues, it cannot be the purity of the body that makes pure the heart; for purity of heart is what makes the body pure. And this is what's essential; for it is from a right heart, knowing and willing what is good, that right behavior will come. So at the same time as he is breaking down long-standing ideas of how one is to walk in the way of God, he is making new ones which are in a way more demanding, in that they urge one to keep God's commandments not out of a sense of legal obligation, but out of a deeply personal understanding of the morality which they hold. Jesus urges his followers to come to an understanding in their own lives of what God wills through the commandments, and then wittingly and willingly live them. And his own understanding, as far as it is presented in this text, is that what God wills above all in the commandments is love; love towards him and towards one another6. Love here is not just a feeling, but a good word and deed, born from the will and the knowledge within, in the heart. This is the profound message of Jesus in the Gospel of Mark, carrying on the message of the prophets of old: one worships God primarily by loving others, in words and deeds which are from the heart; this is the sum of all the law and the prophets. So Jesus continues to break traditional bonds, and make new ones. Just as before he redefined the family as those who do the will of God the father, so now, in shifting the focus of the faith inward, to the human heart, he redefines the community of faith itself. He does this not by removing torah, or rendering it obsolete, but by reinterpreting the way in which it is to be fulfilled. For he says that all one needs to fulfill the law is contained within the human person; in the will and understanding of the good, which is brought to fruition in the love of others. Thus he opens the way for Gentiles also to become the children of God and the heirs of his promise to Abraham. For in this view, these things do not come by keeping the traditions of the eldersnot by circumcision or offerings or rituals to purifybut by keeping the law of love in the heart. The ones who worship God in this way will be members of the community, regardless of aught else.

ENG.G0.35.1,"""Less is More: Courtship in Twelfth Night""",English,Argumentative Essay,"A play with a plot based on various complications surrounding lovein particular unrequited loveTwelfth Night has no shortage of courtship. Indeed, the play is essentially a series of courtships concluding in several marriages at the play's end. Although, courtship is generally considered the preferred means in obtaining one's love object, in Twelfth Night, courtship has an alternate role. Contrary to what one may expect, those characters who court their objects of affection and take steps to deliberately woo them are the least successful in winning their affection, often times completely failing to win the affections of their love and even ending up alone. Alternatively, those characters who cannot court or do not court their objects of love seem to be far more successful in obtaining love or marriage than those who do. This is an idea that is demonstrated in the play's main romantic plot: the love triangle between Duke Orsino, Olivia, and Cesario/Viola. In Twelfth Night, through a series of failed courtships, Shakespeare takes a skeptical stance on courtship, demonstrating that courtship can be a superficial expression of love and that it is not necessarily conducive to love. Through Duke Orsino's failed courtship with Lady Olivia, Shakespeare reinforces the superficiality of courtship present in several of the courtships throughout the play. The play opens with Orsino declaring, If music be the food of love, play on,/ Give me excess of it that, surfeiting,/ The appetite may sicken and so die (I.i. 1-15). In this moment, Orsino portrays love as something that he desires and craves, but this craving is one that leaves him insatiable at times. Because of this, he would like to have love to the point where he no longer desires it. This is an idea that resonates throughout the play and Orsino's character, as he is constantly seeking love, primarily from Lady Olivia. Orsino is adamant in his courtship with Olivia and continues to seek out her affection and make exclamatory statements about his love for her, despite her unwavering rejection. However, as the play progresses, it seems that Orsino is more concerned with merely being in love rather than being in love with Olivia specifically. Indeed, in his courtship with Olivia, he never actually does any of the courting himself, but sends out Valentine and Cesario to court Olivia for him while he complains at home. And at the end of the play, Orsino's love proves fickle as his love for Olivia is quickly abandoned, and he selects Viola for a wife instead. Ultimately, Shakespeare demonstrates that Orsino's declarations of love are superficial and his courtship of Olivia is a selfish endeavor. Thus, through Orsino's courtship with Olivia, Shakespeare reinforces the idea that courtship does not translate into genuine love and can merely be a slew of empty words, as there is a distinct difference between what one says in courtship and what one actually does and feels. Similarly, Shakespeare provides the readers with another example of questionable courtship in the character of Olivia. Despite her passion and declarations of love, Olivia's courtship of Cesario is almost equally superficial and self-indulgent. Like Orsino, Olivia is determined and almost desperate in her courting of Cesario, offering him monetary rewards and fabricating stories, for example, that he has left a ring, to lure him back to her home. However, regardless of how strong Olivia's feelings are, the fact remains that she and her waxen heart have fallen in love with an illusion. Indeed, Cesario does not actually exist in reality; he is a character. In this sense, similar to the way Orsino is in love with love itself, it seems Olivia is more in love with the idea of Cesario than Cesario himself. Like Orsino, Olivia also yearns for her object of affection, one who has adamantly refused her and one she cannot have. However, similar to Orsino, Olivia's courtship of Cesario and declarations of love are not really about Cesario and her love for him, but are melodramatic self-indulgences. Emotionally fickle, Olivia quickly abandons her vow to mourn her brother for seven years' heat and immerses herself in a state of lovesickness for Cesario (I.i.25). And ultimately, at the play's close, Olivia's love is quickly transferred from Cesario to Sebastian. Again, in the character of Olivia, Shakespeare demonstrates the self-indulgent nature of those characters that aggressively court and declare their love to others. As the play progresses, the affections of both Olivia and Orsino seem more like dramatized declarations rather than genuine statements of love. In the world Shakespeare creates in Twelfth Night, the harder one tries, the more insincere and suspect one's motivations appear (and are). Thus, Shakespeare portrays courtship negatively in this sense. Additionally, in Twelfth Night, there is an element of self pre-occupation and a sense of being out of touch with reality in the characters that take deliberate steps to woo their love interests. For example, Orsino's delusions regarding love are brought to the forefront in the conversation he has with Cesario about the differences between a man's love and a woman's love. He says, &No woman's sides can bide the beating of so strong a passion/ As love doth give my heart; no woman's heart/ So big, to hold so much. They lack retention./ Alas their love may be called appetite,/ No motion of the liver, but the palate& (II.iv. 92-97). In this moment, Orsino declares that a woman cannot love with the same passion that a man can. Ironically, in the end, Viola, a woman, has a love for Orsino that is the only instance of genuine, unwavering love throughout the play. Additionally, of the characters in the play, Orsino is the character that lacks the most retention, because although he is undoubtedly determined, he easily disregards Olivia for Viola in the end. Although Olivia eventually marries Sebastian, at least she does so under the guise that it is Cesario. Additionally, Orsino's additional instruction to Cesario to make no compare/ Between that love a woman can bear me/ And that I owe Olivia reveals his selfishness (100-103). Orsino is so deluded in the splendor of his own love, he has become out of touch with reality. This is a selfishness and delusion that is also seen in Olivia (who has fallen in love with woman disguised as a man) and within the subplot in the characters of Malvolio and Sir Andrew (who both genuinely believe they have a legitimate chance of marrying Olivia and sharing her status). By calling into question the character and rationality of those who court and make deliberate attempts to woo their love interests, Shakespeare further critiques courtship and its role in genuine love. Alternatively, Shakespeare gives the one character who literally cannot court the one she loves, the most genuine love in the play. Despite the fact that she cannot convey her love of Orsino explicitly through courtship as a result of her circumstances, Viola's love seems to be the truest of the characters in the play. The difference between Viola's love and the other character's in the play becomes especially apparent in Viola's counterargument to Orsino's assertion that women cannot love as passionately as men. She says, My father had a daughter loved a man&She never told her love,/ But let concealment, like a worm I'th' bud,/ Feed on her damask cheek. She pined in thought,/ And with a green and yellow melancholy/ She sat like patience on a monument,/ Smiling as grief. Was not this love indeed? (107, 110-115). In this moment of near confession, Viola is undoubtedly referring to her own struggles as she deals with unrequited love, a problem both Orsino and Olivia have. However, the private nature of Viola's love is a notable difference. Viola's love exists whether or not it is explicitly expressed through courtship. It is genuine and is not more or less true based on who knows it. This cannot necessarily be said of the love of Orsino and Olivia, as its declaration seems to be one of the few ways in which their love can be thought to actually exist. Indeed, Viola's love does not need to be proclaimed in melodramatic statements or grand gestures. Additionally, Viola is not in love with the idea of being in love as Orsino is or in love with a near fictional character as Olivia is. This characteristic of Viola's love makes it genuine and real in a way that the other characters' love is not. In Twelfth Night, Shakespeare also seems to suggest that courtship somehow cheapens or bastardizes love. In giving the character who does not and is not able to deliberately woo her object of affection, Shakespeare further demonstrates that not only is courtship not necessarily a good indication of real love, courtship is also not necessary to have genuine love for someone. Ultimately, in the play's conclusion, Shakespeare's critique of courtship comes to a head, as each of the various courtships in the novel fail, while other characters, who took part in little to no wooing, find love. Olivia, under the impression that she is marrying Cesario, marries Viola's twin brother Sebastian, who merely accepts Olivia's proposal and gives himself up to love, rather than making any insincere declarations of love to her. Similarly, Orsino does not end up with Olivia as he desires, but rather Viola (formerly Cesario). Thus, Viola, whose love has been genuine throughout the play and who took no part in any courtship, is paired with her object of affection. Additionally, despite ending up with two completely different people than the ones they spent the entire play courting, Olivia and Orsino are perfectly content with their new spouses. This is the ultimate demonstration of the fickle nature of their courtship and love. At one point in the play, Viola (as Cesario) says, We men may say more, swear more, but indeed/ Our shows are more than will; for still we prove/ Much in our vows, but little in our love (II. iv.116-118). Although, Viola says this in a discussion about the difference between men and women, this quote can also be considered a commentary on courtship in general. Throughout the play, Shakespeare demonstrates how those who court their objects of affection say more, swear more, but prove much in [their] vows, and little in [their] love. In Twelfth Night, Shakespeare's attitude toward courtship is decidedly skeptical. Through a series of botched courtships, Shakespeare provides a critique of courtship, in which he questions the potentially superficial nature of courtship and the sincerity, character, and rationality of those who take deliberate steps to woo others. As the play progresses, it becomes increasingly clear that the characters who do take part in courtships are self-motivated and their love is less than genuine. In the end, those characters are not entirely successful in their courtships. Conversely, those who do not court and deliberately woo others seem to fare better. In particular, through the character of Viola, Shakespeare seems to suggest that true love does not need to rely on courtship. Ultimately, in Twelfth Night, Shakespeare demonstrates that courtship is not an adequate measure of genuine love and is not a necessity in obtaining love and/or marriage.

ENG.G0.35.2,"""Andrew Marvell's Definition of Love""",English,Argumentative Essay,"Love has been the topic of literature for centuries. Although experienced by many, love is intangible, difficult to adequately capture in writing, and difficult to define. In his poem The Definition of Love, Andrew Marvell uses a number of abstractions, capitalized for emphasis, in an attempt to define the ultimate abstraction: Love. Born out of Despair, the Love in this poem is characterized by an element of Impossibility and very little Hope, and is ultimately prohibited from its complete culmination by the highly personified abstraction of Fate. In addition to the poem's abstractions, there are geographic and mathematical references, and love is described in terms of mathematical probabilities and impossibilities. Thus, as The Definition of Love continues, the abstract is intermixed with the concrete. Through these oppositional descriptions, Marvell is able to capture the paradoxical nature of love. At the poem's end, both the abstract and the concrete, and the author and his love, cannot be reconciled or joined. Ultimately what emerges is the sense that all real love (that is, existing in reality and permitted by Fate) is flawed, and that the union of a perfect love is an impossibility to achieve. Throughout The Definition of Love, there is an element of impossibility surrounding the love in the poem, and impossibility plays a large role in Marvell's definition of love. Interestingly, despite the fact that the poem is called The Definition of Love, a title that suggests the poem attempts to propose a definitive, all-encompassing description of loveanother task that seems relatively impossiblethe narrator of the poem introduces the love in the poem as my love. As the poem continues, it becomes apparent that this case is perhaps indicative of love in general in some respects. Regardless, the overarching characteristic of the love in this poem is its impossibility, an idea that is introduced in the poem's opening. From the outset, Marvell describes the Impossibility of this Love in terms of abstractions. Marvell writes, My love is of a birth as rare/ As tis, for object, strange and high;/ It was begotten by Despair/ Upon Impossibility (Lines 1-4). Thus, in Marvell's love, Despair, the complete loss or absence of hope, gives rise to Love, despite that love being seemingly unfeasible. Additionally, Marvell goes on to explain that only Magnanimous Despair alone could show me so divine a thing. Where Feeble Hope could ne'er have flown/ But vainly flapped its tinsel wing (4-8). This moment further reiterates the Love's impossibility; it is almost completely void of Hope, a hope in this circumstance that is likened to a bird attempting to fly, but remaining land-ridden. Thus, according to Marvell, it appears that in this Love and perhaps in love generally, Love is doomed from the outset and any attempts to overcome this impossibility are futile. This love seems impossible upon its inception and its impossibility only grows as the poem progresses. The primary reason that the Love in this poem is so plagued by impossibility is the domineering presence of Fate, who refuses to let the two loves unite. Marvell personifies Fate to a great extent throughout the poem and quite negatively, as s/he/it is described as jealous and tyrannical, among other things (Lines 13, 16). Marvell writes, For Fate with jealous eyes does see/ Two perfect loves, nor lets them close; Their union would her ruin be,/ and her tyrannic power depose (Stanza 4, Lines 13-16). Marvell suggests that Fate has a vested interest in preventing this union of love, particular because it is between two perfect loves (14). It becomes clear why exactly the union of the Love in the poem is so impossible: indeed, it the perfect nature of the love in question. As the footnote to the text explains, Two perfections, united, would not be subject to change and thereby to fate (2.). Thus, it appears the love, subject to fate as (or if) all things are, is entirely out of one's own control. Furthermore, the perfect nature of the love, however beneficial perfection is, is also hindered by its perfection, as Fate prevents a perfect love from being completely actualized. Thus, Marvell not only seems to suggest that there is an impossibility associated with love, but that the closer to perfection a love is, the less likely it is to be actualized because of Fate's jealousy. Indeed, perfect love cannot fully exist in reality. Thus, Marvell's definition proposes that love is not (and cannot be) perfect, but rather, imperfect. The idea of the impossibility of perfect love is further reiterated in Marvell's use of mathematical concepts, a stark contrast to much of the poem's abstract language. In particular, the metaphor of mathematical lines is especially revealing. Marvell writes, As lines, so loves oblique may well/ Themselves in every angle greet,/ But ours, so truly parallel,/ Though infinite, can never meet (25-28). Oblique lines, being at a slant, are neither parallel lines nor right angles. As a result, they are able to touch. Parallel lines, on the other hand, never touch. Despite being side by side and a consistent distance apart, if permitted to continue on forever, two parallel lines would never intersect. In this stanza, Marvell likens the perfect love he has with his object of affection to a relationship between parallel lines; although they are corresponding (able to be matched, joined, or interlocked) and even if their love is infinite, they are never united because of the perfect nature of their relationship (dictionary source). Conversely, the relationship between oblique lines is similar to that of a less perfect love. Far from being truly parallel, two lines (or lovers) that are oblique are able to eventually meet within every angle (or unite at some point in time). However, the two lovers represented by the oblique lines are not perfect, but in this imperfection, they are united. Thus, Marvell differentiates between perfect and imperfect love and illustrates the predicament of perfect love through the use of a metaphor utilizing concrete mathematical concepts. Ultimately, the poem's close suggests that this perfect love will not end in the union of lover and loved. Indeed, the poem closes concludes with a contrary idea. In the last stanza, Marvell writes, Therefore the Love which us doth blind,/ But fate so enviously debars,/ Is the conjunction of the mind,/ And opposition of the stars (29-32). In the end, it seems Fate, with her decrees of steal, is the force that definitively determines the outcome of the love in question (17). Because Fate enviously debars the love, and fate is completely out of one's control, then it seems the conjunction Marvell refers to will not occur. Interestingly, Marvell describes the love as the conjunction of the mind,/ and the opposition of the stars (31-32). In these two lines, Marvell appears to be referring to the coming together of the mind, which is based on rational thought, with the stars, which have a heavenly, other world connotation. This could also be thought of as representing the conjunction of the concrete and the abstract. However, if so, the phrase is somewhat paradoxical, as the conjunction involves opposition. If anything, it also seems rather impossible, as it also suggests the combining of two polarities. Similarly, just as the mind and the stars cannot be conjoined, the narrator and his would be lover cannot be united either, just as the set of parallel lines cannot intersect. This last stanza allows Marvell to further reiterates the idea that perfect love is an impossibility and its union cannot be completely attained. In The Definition of Love, Andrew Marvell sets forth a definition of love that is far from perfect. Indeed, throughout the poem, he demonstrates the impossibility of uniting two perfect loves. In doing so, he suggests that a perfect love can never exist in its entirety and in reality because Fate will not let it conjoin. In other words, what Marvell proposes is that perfect love does not actually exist. Like a pair of parallel lines or two polarities, some things simply cannot be conjoined. Perfect love is one of these instances. Indeed, Love is paradoxical and inexplicable at times. Furthermore, it is difficult to define, whether in scientific terms or solely in abstractions. Ultimately, the definition of love Marvell sets forth is based almost entirely on what love is not: perfect.

ENG.G0.37.1,The Last Paper I Ever Wrote in College,English,Argumentative Essay,"Personal interpretations of past timethe stories that people tell themselves in order to explain how they got to the place they currently inhabitare often in deep and ambiguous conflict with the official interpretative devices of a culture. Carolyn Kay Steedman, Landscape for a Good Woman It has been said that history is written by the winners. Indeed, as Walter Benjamin says, Whoever has emerged victorious participates to this day in the triumphal procession in which present rulers step over those who are lying prostrate (Illuminations, 256). But what of the memories of those who lived through the historical events? Before the appearance, or more specifically the study of, postcolonial literature, the stories of indigenous peoples were told by the conquerors and explorers: D.H. Lawrence, Leonard Woolf, and Daniel Defoe. It could perhaps then be inferred that history is a Western theory or recalling the past, while memory is a non-Western method of remembering the past. The emergence of memory as a category of academic discourse is then a healthy result of decolonization (Klein 135). Indeed, the declaration of history and memory as not being polar opposites has become one of the clich�s of the school of thought. Memory is replacing old stand-bys such as nature, culture, and language, as the term most usually coupled with history and that shift is remaking historical imagination (Klein 128). History, as with other key terms, finds its meaning largely through its counter concepts like the future as well as its synonyms the past and thus the emergence of memory seeks to redefine the boundaries of histories. Here, two authors who have broken the boundaries between history and memory in postcolonial literature will be discussed: Derek Walcotts Omeros and J.M Coetzees Waiting for the Barbarians. Walcott and Coetzee depict very different places in very different ways; Walcott describes the mythical history of St. Lucia through multiple voices and experiences, while Coetzee describes the confessional memoir of a single man in an abstract place. Yet both authors aim to do the same thing: to insert their characters memories into broader historical contexts, while at the same time allowing their characters to forget pieces of the past. Walcotts Omeros has been discussed as the juxtaposition between history and myth of the Caribbean island of St. Lucia. To do so is to aptly represent a colonized, decolonized, and postcolonized nation whose history is amalgamation of colonial histography and cultural memory. Instead of privileging one over the other, Walcott rather utilizes both historical and mythical modes of representation precisely in order to foreground the way in which one discourse relies upon and cancels out the other (Williams 277). Walcott abstracts the Caribbean island into mythical proportions by creating a labyrinth of memories, histories, and identities. He translates the single landscape of St. Lucia by repeatedly redefining through different peoples perspectives. Walcott seeks to step analytically sideways, to see the landscape of St. Lucia (literally and metaphorically) from a different angle, to see the life events of Helen, Achilles, Hector, and Plunkett not as trivial or isolated, but significant and necessary to History. At the same time he resists being a part of History. Walcott does not feature a central protagonist, but rather allows the maintenance of a wider interpretation through a chorus of different voices, albeit different experiences. He must negotiate the memories and histories of his characters as well as national identities such as British (the Empire), Greek (the literary tradition), and Aruac (the native culture): where Ogun can fire one with his partner Zeus (Walcott 53). In short, the multiplicity of Omeros is a hybridist cultural exercise. On the other hand, J.M.Coetzees Waiting for the Barbarians employs a single voice to tell the allegorical history of an abstract frontier. By setting his novel in an unnamed country at an unnamed time, by terming the two parties the Empire and the Barbarians&Coetzee creates an allegorical landscape that loosely suggests the Roman Empire on the verge of collapse but undoubtedly points to South Africa today (Gallagher 281). Unlike Walcott, Coetzee indexes a theoretical geography and gives it a single voice. The Magistrate tells the story of the frontier, wherever it may be. By creating a nationalist allegory, Coetzee also creates a universal Empire, or at least an Empire that has existed before, all over the globe. Moreover, Coetzee credits this universal Empire for dictating the way in which history is created. As the Magistrate declares: Empire has created the time of history. Empire has located its existence not in the smooth recurrent spinning time of the cycle of the seasons but in the jagged time of rise and fall, of beginning and end, of catastrophe (Coetzee 133). Though the catastrophe the Magistrate speaks of may be a natural disaster or war, it is evident to readers of Coetzee that he is speaking of the torture and oppression of South Africa, without calling it such. The effect of this time displacement is to reveal truths about any oppressive society& (Gallagher 281-282). Yet by saying so in allegorical terms, he speaks not only to South Africas regime, but to any like it. Just as Coetzee aims to display the truth about the world in which he lives, so too does the Magistrate of his novel. He wishes to leave behind an archive of what has happened on his frontier; the torture, the barbarism, albeit the madness of the Empire. Yet, any time he wishes to speak, write, or know the truth, he is at a loss for words. What the second document is to be I do not yet know. A testament? A memoir? A confession? A history of thirty years on the frontier? (Coetzee 58). The inability to decide which kind of archive to leave says much about the Magistrates ambivalence towards his experience. By wanting to leave a testament he professes his belief about what happened; a memoir would be an account of his personal experience; a confession would admit crimes or wrongdoing; a history would be a record of past events. The Magistrates memory then, is perhaps all of these modes of remembering, which leads him to be indecisive. Yet what he does know is this: I will not disappear into the earth without leaving my mark on them (Coetzee 112). However, to correctly relay the events that have transpired on the frontier, the Magistrate feels he cannot be bounded by law, order, or Empire. &I will abandon the locutions of a civil servant with literary ambitions and begin to tell the truth (Coetzee 154). Nonetheless, memory and history take place in relation to broader social contexts, thus they are always bounded. The Magistrate is bounded by the Empire, whose agenda does not necessarily include the truth about happened, what people remember, but how it serves the Empires interests. Indeed, Colonel Joll (the quintessential representation of the cold, distant Empire with his sunglasses and lack of compassion) very explicitly tells the Magistrate that his memory and the history of his frontier are of little importance: You want to go down in history as a martyr, I suspect. But who is going to put you in the history books? These border troubles are of no significance&People are not interested in the history of the back of beyond (Coetzee 114). Despite his seeming lack of agency as his aims of recalling his memories of the frontier and making a history or them, do not serve the Empires greater interests, the Magistrate wishes to leave his mark in the history book as being the only man who was not a barbarian (Coetzee 104). Another man who wishes to leave his mark on the history books is Walcotts Colonel Plunkett in Omeros. Plunkett obsessively researches the history of the Caribbean island, through its naval archives: History was fact/History was a cannon, not a lizard (Walcott 92). Yet as he delves further into St. Lucias history, he realizes two things: firstly, that he is looking for his memory in the archives. While Plunketts textual identity is governed by and constitutive of a discourse of British imperialism, however, he is nonetheless compelled to construct a familial genealogy in a mode of discourse more mythical than historical (Williams 278). Though he has no association but a name, Plunkett immediately inserts his name into the histories; he calls this sailor his son, as if Plunkett wants his lineage, his memory, to live on through history. Secondly, Plunkett wishes to not only include himself into history, but also Helen, his housemaid, the embodiment of the beautiful island: So Plunkett decided that what the place needed/was its true place in history, that hed spend hours/for Helens sake on research, so he proceeded/to the whir of enormous moths in the still house/Memorys engines (Walcott 64). Plunketts desire to give Helen a history, because he believes she does not have one of her own, without access to History and its archives, echoes Edward Said in his Orientalism where he says, If he does not speak directly for the Orientals, it is because they after all speak another language, yet he knows how they feel since he knows their history, their reliance upon such as he, and their expectations (Said 34). Plunkett wishes to take over, albeit colonizes Helens history because he believes it is he who can properly and objectively represent her. She cannot do it herself, as she has no agency, nor a voice. Plunkett is not the only one trying to define and write Helen. Walcotts Homeresque poet-narrator looks to do the same: Plunkett, in his innocence/had tried to change History to a metaphor/in the name of a housemaid; I, in self-defence/altered her opposite. Yet it was all for her (Walcott 270). Walcotts poet looks to do what Plunkett does, but more prosaically. He writes history from the bottom up, trying to give a voice to silenced people like Achilles, Hector, and Helen, individuals written of and about by those other than themselves. He attempts to tell of moments when the dominate history and ones own experience do not match up: the prose/of abrupt fishermen cursing over canoes (Walcott 15). Yet by doing so, the poet-narrator (and in turn, Walcott) believes he is only perpetuating the myth of history: What I had read and rewritten till literature/was as guilty as History (Walcott 271). By inserting these everyday people and their experiences into the epic, Walcott creates a discord, but in doing so makes them legitimate for the epic genre, and renders them fit for the grandiose, for History. Perhaps then, there was no real need for the historians/remorse, nor for literatures (Walcott 271). In the creation of history, through the memories of a single man, or a multitude of island denizens, there is also the creation of forgetting. Whether intentional or unintentional, to recall, write, or sing the past is also to forget some of it. For Coetzees Magistrate, the forgetting is a very intentional act. He wants to forget the Empire, the frontier, the Barbarians, as a means to erase the anguish of what he has seen and experienced. It would be better if this chapter in history of the world were terminated at once&and we swore to make a new start, to run an empire in which there would be no more injustice, no more pain (Coetzee 24). The Magistrates intentional forgetting is due to the guilt he feels for letting torture and hunting of the barbarians happen. His guilt, and his forgetting of his guilt, manifest in the Magistrates relationship with the barbarian girl. After being tortured by the soldiers of the Empire, she is blind and crippled; the Magistrate forms an intimate relationship with her, perhaps to alleviate his guilt. So I begin to face the truth of what I am trying to do: to obliterate the girl. I realize that if I took a pencil to sketch her face I would not know where to start. Is she truly so featureless? (Coetzee 47). It is not that the girl is featureless so much as it is that the Magistrate wants her to be so. He wants to first understand her scarred body, and then erase it; her marked body will not allow him to forget, thus he wishes to erase her body. Throughout the novel, when the Magistrate searches for meaning, he confronts blankness (Gallagher 279). So it is with the barbarian girl, and his desire to obliterate her and the history on her body. For those inhabiting Walcotts Omeros, the forgetting is less a deliberate deed and more a consequence of a colonial history that writes and rewrites the islands experience. We think of the past/as better forgotten than fixed with stony regret (Walcott 192). To remember is to regret; to forget is to let go. In a text where multiple traditions and characters overlap, it seems only natural that certain moments, names, places, and people are forgotten, and there is little that can be done about it. This was history. I had no power to change it (Walcott 217). But forgetting is a form of loss, and by forgetting names, places, and people, the island suffers. What was once Iounalao, becomes St. Lucia, and the men who contributed to the islands growth become merely myths: but the builders names are not there/not Hectors ancestors, Philoctetes, nor Achilles (Walcott 315). It is both that the colonial history of the island forgets the builders and Iounalao as well as they forgetting themselves. For those to whom history is the presence/of ruins, there is a green nothing (Walcott 192). To do so is not an act of submission or resistance, but merely a natural part of life. What Coetzees Magistrate and Walcotts characters (specifically Plunkett and the poet-narrator) aim to do is place their own memories of themselves and their places into a larger historical narrative; for those who are lying prostrate as Walter Benjamin puts it, to rise to their feet. Memory then is a mechanism used to make, assert, and insert unique stories into a history. Yet it is not only a question of how and what individuals remember and how they represent their memories, but also what might be christened a cultural struggle over the creation and meanings of memory within culture; the ways in which the very means and possibility of remembering are created (King 5). For the Magistrate, Coetzee creates a solo lamenting the somewhat invisible injustices of the Empires frontier, and how this one voice will be the only one to tell the truth of what has happened to the people at the back of beyond. For Plunkett, and the poet-narrator, Walcott creates a chorus singing the island St. Lucia, and her ordinary inhabitants, living ordinary but meaningful lives. Yet in both songs, the authors, and their characters, embrace their memories into the Histories.

ENG.G0.39.2,The Image of Mary,English,Argumentative Essay,"In the books of John and Matthew, Mary's role as a mother is discredited in both passages because she is not given any voice in any decision making process regarding the conception, birth, and life of her child. She also is not given any authoritative power to regulate her child's behavior within the text. Although there are differences in how she is presented in Matthew and John, she is not given respect or authority as Jesus' mother in either book. In Matthew, she is acknowledged as divinely yet potentially unwillingly impregnated with Jesus by God and in John she is mentioned casually in the text, diminishing the magnitude of a mother-child relationship. In the book of Matthew, Mary can be viewed as victim of divine rape. We are told in Chapter 1:18 Now the birth of Jesus the Messiah took place in this way. When his mother Mary had been engaged to Joseph, but before they lived together, she was found to be with child from the Holy Spirit. The text does not say that she found out she was with child from the Holy Spirit, it just says she was found to be with child. This leaves the reader pondering the question, who found out she was with child and how was it found out that she was with child? Later in the text it says ...an angel of the Lord appeared to him [Joseph] in a dream and said Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for the child conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit (Matthew 18:20). Only later does it say that the Angel of the Lord revealed to Joseph in a dream that she was with child from the holy spirit. We as readers can assume that because this is the first explanation of how Mary became pregnant within the text, this may very well be the first time she received information and an understanding of what was going on within her own body. If this is true, the text tells us that the message, terms and guidelines of Mary's pregnancy were delivered through Joseph, who at that time had not become her husband. We do not know if Mary was aware of this prior to it being revealed to Joseph in the dream, but we can assume that she did not because this was the first mention of it in the text. Generally, a woman is the first person, with the exception of her medical doctor, to know that she is pregnant, and has the final decision in what to do with her child, unless she is a minor. This concept is made null and void because the text tells the reader that Joseph had more knowledge, and thus power, over her body than she does. This takes away from her role as mother because the text gives Joseph total dominion over her body. It sets readers up to look at Jesus' paternal figure as more knowledgeable than his maternal figure, both in divine (God) and in the flesh (Joseph). Another silent spot within the text is how God planted the seed within Mary. As discussed in class, there are several different words for the English word virgin, and each may have its own interpretation. The text references Isaiah when it says Look, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they shall name him Emmanuel. Depending on one's interpretation, we can assume that Mary had never had sexual intercourse. God may or may not have mated with Mary, but there is still a void within the text as to what exactly took place for her to become pregnant. The text also does not say that God had made an arrangement with Mary, or why God had selected Mary to be the carrier of Jesus. Thus we can conclude that Mary's pregnancy may not have been consensual. The text also does not reveal what Mary's emotions were about this situation. It is possible that she was happy to be pregnant with the son of God, but she may have been very angry that she did not have a choice in the situation. Because the text does not tell, we can assume that her opinion ultimately was viewed as unimportant or irrelevant to the story. In the book of John, Mary's role as mother is discredited because the text opens up with an intense introduction of Jesus as the divine son of God. In John 1:1-5, it says In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things came into being through him and without him not one thing came into being. What has come into being in him was life, and the life was the light of all people. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not overcome it. We are not explicitly told that this passage is referring to Jesus. However later in the book, chapter 14:6, Jesus clarifies this passage by saying ...I am the way, and the truth, and the life, No one comes to the Father except through me. This tells us that the Jesus is the life being referenced, thus the passage puts a disclaimer on the magnitude of the relationship between God and Jesus. By saying He was in the beginning with God we can infer that God truly cherishes Jesus, leaving little room for Mary to be able to have a motherly bond with Jesus because he is already so close to his divine Father. It is also evident that the book of John downplays Mary's role because the first introduction we have to her is in Chapter 2:1-5. In the very first verse, it says On the third day there was a wedding in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there. In this text, Jesus' mother never even receives a name. She is simply referred to as the mother of Jesus. In addition, Jesus' relationship with God as his father was announced in the beginning of the book, so that readers can clearly recognize how close they are. In comparison to this, the sentence that shows the reader who Jesus' mother is ...and the mother of Jesus was there sounds like an afterthought or a common courtesy as opposed to intense, pertinent information. Her role as mother is further discredited when we see Jesus backtalk her in Chapter 2:4And Jesus said to her, Woman, what concern is that to you and to me? My hour has not yet come. The footnotes in the text say that the word woman is a term of respect and affection and cross reference other chapters in the book of John. However, in Genesis 2:23 we are told this at last is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; this one shall be called Woman, for out of Man this one was taken. This gives the reader the impression that because Jesus is referring to her as Woman, he views himself as her superior, rather than humbly acknowledging her as his mother. We know that he always refers to God as Father (example: ...The works that the Father has given me to complete, the very works that I am doing, testify on my behalf that the Father has sent me (John 5:36), but he does not refer to Mary as mother. Also, his response to his mother can be interpreted as selfish, arrogant and snappy toward his mother because he says what concern is that to you and me and my hour has not yet come. However, he never talks or responds to God in this tone. We can assume that Jesus respects his relationship with his Father, God, more than he does with Mary, discrediting her role as his mother. In both Matthew and John, readers are made aware that Jesus had an earthly mother, yet the text does not give her the credit she deserves as mother. The text tells us that God is the ruler and father of Jesus, and ultimately there is no mutual common ground between Jesus' relationship with his father God and his relationship with his mother Mary. Mary is still perceived to have had a hand in Jesus good will, yet her authority will always be superseded by whatever male is available.

ENG.G0.40.1,Deep Sleep And The Inability To Exist In Works of Fantasy,English,Argumentative Essay,"�In G�briel Garc�a M�rquez's One Hundred Years of Solitude, insomnia hits the focal village of Macondo, spreading like a virus throughout. This plague causes memory loss in all it affects, going so far as to cause the villager's loss of comprehension of their very own language. This insomnia serves as a metaphor for the detrimental effects of a discordant individual upon society, instilling the loss of identity amongst an entire culture. In other works, this metaphor is often reversed, highlighting the detrimental effects of an incompatible society upon the individual. Likewise, the use of insomnia is replaced with its opposite: sleep, to which the appearance of deep sleep in works of fantasy symbolizes a character's inability to live in an unfulfilling world. Virginia Woolf's title character in Orlando finds himself increasingly polarized by the world around him, leading to his general dissatisfaction. Yet Orlando is tired not of himself, but of the discomfort of&his way of life, and&the primitive manners of the people (Woolf, 23). With a sense of being in direct contrast with the environment around him, he finds the world oppressive and distressing. Orlando copes with these feelings in creating a persona discordant with his inner self, chang[ing] from a sulky stripling&to a nobleman, full of grace and manly courtesy (Woolf, 31). Finding himself in contrast to the constructs of society, he changes himself to operate within the customs of his environment. Yet in betraying his true feelings, Orlando finds only temporary bliss, interchanging moments of joy with fall[s] into&moods of melancholy to which he only think[s] of death (Woolf, 33-34). With his masquerade of character providing no relief, he seeks only escape from this unfulfilling world. Faced with the irreconcilable rift between himself and society, Orlando chooses to leave his external life, instead lay[ing]&as if in a trance where he does not wake, take food, or show any sign of life for seven whole days (Woolf, 49-50). E.T.A. Hoffmann's Nathanael in The Sandman too finds himself in a substandard world that cannot reflect or cultivate his own passions. His impassioned letters to Klara express his feelings of impending doom loom[ing]&over [him]&like black clouds&impervious to every ray of friendly sunshine (Hoffmann, 93). The very fervor that drives his existence meets nothing but dilapidation in his surroundings, stagnating his growth. With Klara the personification of his society, their love is plagued by some dark hand which&intrude[s]&into their lives, snatching away incipient joy (Hoffmann, 108). Nathanael's paradigms prove antagonistic to the foundations of the community he lives in, disallowing him the capability of experiencing true happiness. Nathanael must seek relief from societal constraints, found only in Olimpia, the only one that truly understand[s&him] (Hoffmann, 118). The only escape he can find from a gloomy and austere world is found in a reflection of himself in the automaton. With the eventual revelation of Olimpia's true being, Nathanael can only find true escape in a deep and frightful dream (Hoffmann, 123). With his initial escape from the world in the deep sleep, Orlando hopes to find fulfillment in other lands, only to be greeted with the same melancholy constraints. Again needing an escape from a repressive world, Orlando enters a deep sleep, and can only be awakened from the blow [of]&one terrific blast: The Truth! (Woolf, 102). It is only through truly finding ones true self that one can find true bliss. In this acceptance, Orlando begins to path towards a life of contentment, fully realized in the fact that Orlando had become a woman (Woolf, 102). This metamorphosis serves to unmask Orlando's true self, and with this revelation, hope to find meaning in a previously unfulfilling world. Indeed, a new love of Nature [is]&inborn in her, with new perspectives and streams of thoughts (Woolf, 106). Eventually, this cultivation of character allows her to find meaning in the right time and place, leading to pure ecstasy (Woolf, 240). Where Orlando undertakes a complete transformation of sex and eta to achieve fulfillment, Nathanael cannot transcend his own time period after his own awakening from his deep sleep. The same world driving him into his deep sleep greets him upon his awakening, making him feel as if he is the horrible plaything of dark powers, [to]&which it [is]&in vain to resist (Hoffmann, 107). For all of his attempts at change, he finds himself unable to overcome such an environment. In climbing to the topmost gallery of the tower looking down into the hoods, Nathanael realizes the vast extent of his restricting society (Hoffmann, 124). With his very survival dependent on societal constructs, he realizes that he cannot find happiness in this realm. As such, Nathanael finds his only means of escape, to destroy his sources of discontent in a circle of fire, concluding with a shattering scream [and]&jump& from the tower to his death (Hoffmann, 125). Nathanael's only hope for true liberation and fulfillment lie outside of this world, which he can reach only in death. It is through a strictly natural cause that M�rquez's village of Macondo rids itself of the magical plague of insomnia: a traveler brings medicine that cures the illness to the land. Yet to do the opposite  resolve the problems causing a deep sleep  requires just the contrary: Woolf's Orlando undergoes a metamorphosis, Hoffmann's Nathanael is set ablaze upon the sight of his nemesis, Lewis Carroll's Alice must undergo the tribulations of Wonderland, and Sleeping Beauty receives a magical kiss from her prince. Where societal factors lay behind the destruction of civilization, behind the destruction of one's inner self lays metaphysical origins, often demonstrated through the use of the fantastic.

ENG.G0.41.1,Anti-Aristotelian Kane,English,Argumentative Essay,"If the purpose of art is, as Aristotle posited, to mimic reality, then the paradigm of classical tragedy and Kane's contemporary play Blasted represent two radically opposed methods for accomplishing this. The constituent elements of contemporary drama such as plot, character, and setting remain largely similar to their ancient antecedents in the Greek Dionysia. The difference is found in the methods by which playwright's like Kane implement, synthesize, and subordinate these elements to create a new form of mimicry for what might arguably be considered, despite the assertions of postmodernists, a similar human reality. Aristotle's analysis of tragic elements and the qualities that allow them to succeed ultimately yield a model for tragedy in which causality, order, morality, and balance are mimicked and an idealized reality reflected. Kane's Blasted completely inverts the Aristotelian paradigm by depicting a reality that is seemingly random, chaotic, amoral, and imbalanced. In his analysis of tragedy, Aristotle subordinates all constituent elements to plot. That is to say, plot rather than any other element is the ideal vehicle by which the tragedy progresses. Though characters intersect with plot, indeed, even advance it, the Aristotelian model for plot stands independently of character, ultimately providing the instigation for their actions. In this sense, characters give the mere illusion of volition as they act because they are ultimately reacting to influences beyond their control, events that fall within the realm of plot. The impetuses of these events are external as in the conditions of the environment, decrees of fate, or interventions of gods. For example, in Oedipus Rex, presumably the tragedy closest to Aristotle's ideal, characters such as Tiresias, the Shepherd, and the Messenger arrive in the play to deliver information about events that concern mortals like Oedipus, Laius, and Jocasta but do not originate with them. It is ultimately revealed that any actions such characters took during these events were motivated by the prophecies of Apollo delivered by the Delphic oracle. In this way, actions that human characters appear to undertake are instigated by external, typically divine or cosmic influences. However, the events in Blasted, rather than externally imposing themselves onto characters, arise from the actions of the characters. In the first scene, for instance, the events are confined to the interactions of Ian and Cate within the setting of a small hotel room. For much of the scene, they are little more than antagonistic gestures and dialogue, though Ian's sexual misconduct toward Cate motivates her, in part, to abandon him. The only event that one might construe as having an external impetus is the arrival of the soldier. While this event does admittedly impose on Ian and seems to originate beyond the scope of his interactions with Cate, it still occurs within the scope of character. In contrast to Oedipus Rex in which characters bear the decree of gods and fate through the accounts they relay, the soldier enters the immediate present of Blasted on his own volition. In these ways, the play is character-driven rather than plot-driven in the Aristotelian sense. Ultimately, the plot-driven tragedy, especially in the classical tradition, affords its protagonists relative blamelessness as they become little more than vessels of some divine or cosmic design. Because of this, their tragic fortunes evoke pity and the lessons reflected in them can be applied universally. A character-driven tragedy forces the onuses of volition and action back onto the character. Consequently, the faults that lead characters down the tragic path are their own, as are the devastating results. In this way, classical tragedy asserts an interpretation of reality in which humans are subjected to influences beyond their control and thus, their innate morality remains intact. In Blasted, by contrast, Ian reflects on the lack of god or cosmic justice quite literally in a conversation with Cate in the fourth scene: Ian: No God. No Father Christmas. No fairies. No Narnia. Cate: Got to be something. Ian: Why Cate: Doesn't make sense otherwise. Ian: Don't be fucking stupid, doesn't make sense anyway. No reason for there to be a God just because it would be better if there was (Lines 102-109). This might be considered Ian's most significant moment of recognition after he is blinded and left for dead. He realizes that the idea of God is impossible; he recognizes that misery, universal and personal, is human. In this sense, the play asserts an interpretation of reality in which humans choose for themselves the ways in which they transgress and thus, they willingly eroding any innate morality they might have once possessed. The play's plot, in addition to arising from characters rather than imposing itself on them, is discordant with classical standards of tragic causality. Aristotle asserts in Poetics: The function of the poet is not to say has happened, but to say the kind of thing that would happen, i.e. what is possible in accordance with probability or necessity. [&] Of simple plots and actions, the episodic ones are the worst. By an episodic plot I mean one in which the sequence of episodes is neither necessary nor probable (16-17). Here he claims the ideal plot grows out of itself organically, following a logical, self-contained trajectory. The plot must be probable in that it is something that could plausibly happen and necessary in that it is what must logically happen. Again, using Oedipus Rex as an example, the plot follows causally from the murder of Laius, to the plague on Thebes, to Oedipus' quest to uncover the truth, and finally, to his tragic recognition of it. Such plots, despite the horrendousness of their ends, give the impression of ordered action and consequently, an ordered reality. The implicit argument of such a structure is that no matter how dire one's fortunes change, their circumstances ultimately accord with a sort of cosmic logic. The plot of Blasted, by contrast, is almost entirely devoid of any discernable elements of this sort of logic. The action of the initial scene primarily focuses on the emotional and sexual abuses Ian commits against Cate. The soldier's entry the hotel room and Cate's escape represent a critical break in the causality. The reader or audience catch Ian's diffuse allusions to a back-story that acknowledges the possibility that somebody dangerous might come through the door. However, apart from this and a vague foreboding evoked by Ian's possession of a revolver, there is nothing within the scope of the play's action, dialogue, or descriptive passages to indicate that the soldier's intrusion is inevitable. There is no reference through the stage directions or in the conversation between Ian and Cate to any other specific characters that might find their way into the hotel room. It could be a local war-scavenger, refugee, or one of Ian's former co-workers who enters as easily as it could be the soldier. In this sense, the event can be loosely interpreted as probable but definitely not as necessary. As such, it injects the plot with a certain element of randomness. Furthermore, it truncates the events centered on Ian and Cate, creating a new sequential thread in which the focus becomes the interactions between the Soldier and Ian. This new event sequence is characterized by a discursive, unpredictable, seemingly random progression of dialogue and action. This discursive quality is reflected in the stage directions during the end of the third scene and the beginning of the fourth: He kisses Ian very tenderly on the lips. They stare at each other./ [&] He pulls down Ian's trousers, undoes his own and rapes himeyes closed and smelling Ian's hair. The Soldier is crying out. Ian's face registers pain but he is silent. When the soldier has finished he pulls up his trousers and pushes the revolve up Ian's anus./ [&] He puts his mouth over one of Ian's eyes, sucks it out, bites it off, and eats it. He does the same with the other eye./ The solider lies close to Ian, the revolver in his hand. He has blown his own brain out (885). Just as there is little, if any, discernable structural logic in the soldier's initial arrival, there is the same absence in his actions. The Soldier's tendency to alternatively and simultaneously behave with tenderness, savageness, nostalgia, calculated cruelty, and lamentation perhaps represents the pinnacle of diseased psychology within the character and disordered causality within the plot. It is the tortured logic of insanity that leads him from committing a rape to committing suicide. Ultimately, as events of the play are reflected in the insanity of the character, it must be concluded that the world Kane represents in her play is similarly insane and the mimesis she attempts stands in drastic opposition to the ordered, moral, and otherwise logical mimesis of the Aristotelian tragedy. Kane's Blasted depicts a world that is amoral, disordered, illogical, and in almost every other way antithetical to classical tragedy. Rather than asserting any sort of implicit rhetoric about cosmic order by subordinating character to plot, she elevates character above plot. Thus, she brings depravity and the responsibility for it back into the human realm. Rather than constructing a plot arc causally linked by probability and necessity as Aristotle suggested is ideal, she shapes one that resists clearly definable teleology and inevitability. Thus, she depicts a world that cannot be confined to any sort of precise logic and consequently, cannot be depended on for order or justice. Kane and Aristotle both seem to agree that the fundamental objective of art, specifically dramatic tragedy, is to mimic reality. However, interpretation of the reality in which the philosopher or playwright chooses to situate that mimesis remains entirely subjective.

ENG.G0.41.3,Classical and Modern Representations in O'Neill,English,Argumentative Essay,"The playwright Eugene O'Neill brought many innovations to American drama. His voluminous works reflect a harmonious integration of elements from anachronistic and seemingly disparate traditions such as classicism, modernism, impressionism, and naturalism. Further, much of what make such a heterogeneous texture of dramatic writing so rich are its implications for what it means to be human. Specifically, if literature is supposed to offer examples of how it is people can, should, or actually do live, it makes sense that human life should be represented multi-dimensionally with different people, in different settings, struggling against different obstacles. In this sense, O'Neill brings to audiences and readers plays that portray tragedy within the self and outside of it, arising from the mind as well as acting upon it. Two of his major dramatic works reflect this pattern in his writing: Mourning Becomes Electra and The Iceman Cometh. While Mourning Becomes Electra demonstrates a more classical, circumstance-oriented view of human life through treatment of character as the sum of his/her actions under the influence of cosmic forces, The Iceman Cometh reflects a more modern, psychologically-oriented view through its exploration of the tragedies of characters' inner lives. O'Neill draws directly from dramaturgical and thematic elements of Aeschylus' The Oresteia to create the dramatic trilogy Mourning Becomes Electra in truest adherence to the conventions of classical tragedy. As one might expect in this context, characters are represented through their actions in opposition (or according) to some idea of fate and the supernatural forces upholding it. In keeping with the spirit of classical tragedy, characters' missteps, both intentional and unintentional, are punished in a way congruent with some idea of a just and proportionate cosmic balance. Similarly, the tragic effect arises from characters' recognition of the significance of events that have occurred within the scope of the play's present. This immediacy of action and temporality restricts the expression of characters' psychology to the ways in which it manifests directly in the plot, through action. One dramaturgical device in particular epitomizes the classical convention of fate predominating over any sense of agency or choice a character might have: the possession of the progeny by the dead progenitors. After the murder of Adam Brant and the subsequent suicide of Christine Mannon which occur in The Hunted, the first act of The Haunted begins one year later with Orin and Lavinia assuming the physical and postural aspects of their same-sex parent. The reader is given these descriptions of Orin and Lavinia: Then Lavinia enters [&]. One is immediately aware of an extraordinary change in her. Her body, formerly so thin and undeveloped, has filled out. Her movements have lost their square-shaped stiffness. She now bears a striking resemblance to her mother in every respect, even to being dressed in the green her mother had affected [&]. [Orin] carries himself woodenly erect now like a soldier. His movements and attitudes have the statue-like quality that was so marked in his father. [&] The Mannon semblance of his face in repose to a mask is more pronounced than ever (384-385). In this sense, the possession by their parents has begun. However, its initial manifestation in Orin's and Lavinia's reflection of their parents' superficial qualities grows more influential, eventually acting on their behaviors until they quite literally become their parents. This transformation is almost never demonstrated through soliloquy or many of the conventional methods for exploring characters' psychology. Rather, it is demonstrated through character action and interaction. As The Haunted progresses, this possession begins to form one of the play's main antagonistic thrusts: the tension between Lavinia as she is her mother and Orin as he is his father. The guilty Mannon conscience consuming Orin, presumably instilled by the ghost of Ezra, and the selfish, scheming duplicity Lavinia develops while inhabited by Christine altogether become the main vehicles of conflict driving the play forward. An example is found in these two passages during the rising action in the second act: Lavinia(with a sudden flare of deliberately evil taunting that recalls her mother in the last act of ""Homecoming,"" when she was goading Ezra Mannon to fury just before his murder) [&] I'm not your property! I have a right to love! Orin(reacting as his father hadhis face grown lividwith a hoarse cry of fury grabs her by the throat) Youyou whore! I'll kill you! (401). Orin(with quite a mad insistence) Can't you see I'm now in Father's place and you're Mother? That's the evil destiny out of the past I haven't dared predict! I'm the Mannon you're chained to! [&] Lavinia(putting her hands over her ears) For God's sake, won't you be quiet! ([&] unconsciously repeating the exact threat she had goaded her mother to make in Act Two of Homecoming) Take care, Orin! You'll be responsible if! (402). In both these passages, it becomes apparent that as Orin and Lavinia inherit the ghosts of their parents, they inherit the sins they committed in life. As the siblings recreate the argument leading up to Ezra Mannon's murder, Orin's lines illuminate the thematic implication readers or audiences are meant to understand: the doom of the children is for them to become their parents and their past. Ultimately, the trajectory of the possession culminates in Lavinia's stunning recognition (as well as the reader's) as she finally understands and distills the significance of the play's events into the lines I'm bound hereto the Mannon dead. [&] It takes the Mannons to punish themselves for being born (423). Ultimately, O'Neill recreates in this play the notion which resonated throughout so much classical tragedy: a person is their actions (despite their lack of control over them). By driving the play forward entirely with the plot, audiences and readers see characters represented almost entirely through their sequences of actions and reactions. Similarly, the influence of the fate factor via the supernatural possession ensures that they are sufficiently punished for their transgressions. Finally, the tragic effect of the play arises from the character's recognition of the significance of her actions. Any attention given to character psychology is incidental. In the world portrayed in Mourning Becomes Electra, a human being is provoked, acts and reacts under the influences of forces they often do not understand, is punished, and purified by the recognition of how they have transgressed against the cosmic order. In The Iceman Cometh, O'Neill works within a more naturalistic, modern, and character-driven context. The back room at Harry Hope's bar serves as the space in which the audience watches characters interact. By setting the majority of the action in this location, O'Neill creates a grotesque reflection of Ibsenian setting. Whereas in an Ibsen play, a Victorian drawing room might come to epitomize and evoke Northern European bourgeois society, in The Iceman Cometh, the back room of the bar becomes iconic of Skid Row alcoholism and sets the stage for a play whose focus is a subgroup of some of the most dejected characters to be found within the working class. The single, confined bar setting restricts the possibilities for characters' actual physical action to whatever can be performed within its proximity. Indeed, within this limited space, characters do little more physically than drink and sleep. However, it is in the sense that this claustrophobic feeling opens up space in the characters and on the stage for the dynamics of the inner life that the play's modernism arises. The play contrasts with Mourning Becomes Electra most significantly in the sense that characters' psychology is brought to the forefront at the limitation of their actions. Similarly, the most significant events occur outside of the scope of the play's present rather than within it. When the scope of physical mobility is limited, actions must arise from, and ultimately have their impact on, the richly written dimensions of characters' psychology. It is in this way that O'Neill deviates radically from most classical notions of action. Rather than relying on the actions of characters under the influence gods or fate to reveal characters and yield representations of human life, he illuminates the realm of characters' psychology as the precursor to action or inaction. Indeed, through its primary antagonistic force, Hickey, the play seems to most directly focus on what characters are not doing rather than what they are. When Hickey arrives and attempts to convert his former friends with a message of existential reform, the main antagonistic thrusts of the play begin: those between Hickey and the other characters and between each character and his conscience. When Larry admonishes Hickey for attempting to disabuse another character, Hickey responds: [&] I have pity but now I've seen the light, it isn't my old kind of pitythe kind yours is. It isn't the kind that lets off easy by encouraging some poor guy to go on kidding himself with a liethe kind that leaves the poor slob worse off because it makes him feel guiltier than everthe kind that makes his lying hopes nag at him and reproach him until he's a rotten skunk in his own eyes. (With a salesman's persuasiveness) No, sir. The kind of pity I feel now is after final results that will really save the poor guy, and make him contented with what he is, and quite battling himself, and find peace for the rest of his life (88). In his proselytizing, he calls into question the nature of each character's delusions, or pipe-dreams. Though the other characters resist these attempts at conversion in their own ways and to varying degrees, many of them begin to question the validity of Hickey's observations. They realize (but seldom admit) that despite Hickey's abrasiveness, he is often fairly accurate in his assessment of their pipe dreams. As many of them begin to confront their delusions by making preparations to resume the failed endeavors that led them to the bar in the first place, the tenuous connections holding their group together become threatened. As characters uncomfortably and unwillingly rise to higher levels of self-awareness and become forced to confront their own issues, their deeply suppressed and long-held tensions with other characters come to the forefront. In this way, O'Neill creates a community of characters whose ability to exist and coexist relies solely on their capacity for codependent self-delusion. As he examines the question of what happens when that delusion is disabused, he highlights the profound dynamism of stagnation and the influence of character psychology often as instigator, means, and end of action. Beyond this, though, O'Neill seems to remain adamant that no single character exist above the influence of this delusion, even Hickey. As Hickey tries to save the other characters from their pipe dreams, he reveals traces of his own. Collectively, these traces lead up to the revelation that his newfound perspectives regarding personal agency, self-awareness, and redemption through the erosion of delusion, are the mask with which he has covered the murder of his wife and the madness that results. Even more ironic than this revelation is that it happens in every other character but Hickey. After his entire crusade against pipe-dreams, he is led off to Bellevue with his own pipe-dream intact, ultimately proving the most grossly deluded character in the play. In this way, the culmination is in the revelation of Hickey's inner state rather than some sort of lamentation of recognition arising from a reflection of the events surrounding it. The fact that the play's most tragic character retains his pipe-dream until the end attests to the inescapability of delusion despite one's earnestness, deeds, awareness, or stature. In the world reflected by The Iceman Cometh, people's lives their lives in the delusion of what they should, could, or deserve to be as opposed to the reality of who they are and what they do. Ultimately, by the definition O'Neill asserts with this play, the most profound tragedy occurs not as a result of circumstance or fate, but in the realm of a person's psychology. With Mourning Becomes Electra, O'Neill creates a classical representation of human life in which tragedy arises from the way a person recognizes their mistakes relative to a higher moral order. In this representation, there are forces that control a person that remain beyond their control, conspiring to maintain a cosmic balance in which transgression is balanced with proportionate punishment. In this representation, a person is their actions rather than their thoughts. With The Iceman Cometh, O'Neill creates a more modern representation of human life in which tragedy arises from a person's psychology, specifically their capacity for self-delusion. In this representation, notions of the moral order or cosmic balance governing reality are obscured because people do not share an objective reality. In this representation, a person is their thoughts and not their actions. With these two dramatic works, O'Neill gives readers and audiences a richly-textured portrayal of human existence.

ENG.G0.42.2,Sexuality in Ancient Greece,English,Argumentative Essay,"Anacreon once wrote a lyric which included the lines, I love Cleobulus, I am mad for Cleobulus, I gaze at Cleobulus. 1 Because this Cleobulus is in other fragments named as a boy, may we then assume that Anacreon was homosexual? Or does that modern term not apply to the Ancient Greeks? Any argument for Anacreon's sexual aberrance (by contemporary Western standards) would be complicated, then, by others of his poems in which he longs for a girl. And then there is his admiration for a slave. Taking the poet's full collection into account, then, might suggest desires motivated by some other factor than male flesh. But what is sexuality without the sex-object? David M. Halperin suggest that Greek and Roman men..generally understood sex to be defined in terms of sexual penetration and phallic pleasure, whether the sexual partners were two males, two females, or one male and one female. 2 The ancients' choices pertaining to sex, then, would seem to be modeled more on some sense of power or male completeness rather than on individual sexual object choices. In fact, considerations of anatomical sex (male or female) differences do not seem to have entered into the minds of the Greeks at all. Though they realized that a man and woman paired were required to propagate the species, Diotima-via-Socrates-via-Plato claims that it is an equally salubrious fate to focus instead on the birthing of beautiful, good ideas between friends. Furthermore, the beauty exhibited in all bodies is one and the same. 3 So in a group consciousness which placed no definite distinctions between the physical male and female, the right and wrongs of sex was necessarily placed on other views of societal appropriateness. Artemidoros, a popular dream analyst of the time, clarifies that 'Natural and conventional' acts are all those in which a man penetrates a social inferior&, is penetrated by another man, or masturbates. 3 In other words, because social inferiors of a Greek man were understood to be their wives, slaves, or young boys of a lower social class, ancient sexuality was not sexuality at all (in the way that we know it as individual sexual preferences based on the phenotypic and biological differences between men and women), but a complicated political network through which a Greek man was expected to ascend to power. For example, in Pindar's Olympian ode, the poet mentions a reworked history of Pelops, the ivory-shouldered man who so captured Poseidon's fancy. Though he ostensibly played the penetrated role in the subsequent relationship, the fact that it was to the god of the seas made it an unnatural coupling to be foreborn. What makes Pelops a strong, respectable masculine figure is that he confronts Poseidon with a bold proposition  that if the god appreciated his sexual services, Poseidon will help him win Hippodameia, the glorious daughter of a king in Pisa, as his wife. The god consents, and the princess bears Pelops six sons to become lords of the people. 5 Here, we see a sexual choice made with an eye to a long-term sociopolitical agenda. Though Pelops did (perhaps shamefully) become the lover instead of the masculine beloved, a lover may submit to any form of servitude to his beloved without shameful servility&[and] servitude which has for its object the acquisition of excellence. 6 The wisdom of sex for personal gain is a fickle one, though. As a tool for social mobility, sexual nature may be called into question when, like Timarchos, the personal gain is deemd to be waste and unnecessary excess. Such a man, Aeschines (read: the Greeks) reason, who would sell his body for money when he has squandered his own inheritance, could easily sell the nation in a position of higher power. Note, however, that the judgement again falls not because of Timarchos' sexual objects (men), but because of the social interactions through which he becomes acquainted with them.7 With these various textual examples, then, we have arrived at the conclusion that sexuality did not exist in its current dichotomy of homosexual  heterosexual in ancient Greece. Rather than anatomical differentiation, people were arranged into genders of masculine or feminine, terms dependent upon much older stereotypes of dominant social behavior and independent of an individual's biological sex. Because it is the masculine, penetrative form that was seen to be the most fit to govern, sexual choices ultimately pointed to desires for personal, social, and/or political gain rather than any innate inclinations. For the ancient Greeks, sexual identity does not organize the person but is peripheral to the central goals and worries which are focused on survival. 8 It is, unsurprisingly enough, the same brand of self-interested sexuality which would appall and disgust even many impious minds of today.

ENG.G0.43.1,Margery Kempe's Self-Fashioning: Visioning Herself in God,English,Argumentative Essay,"The Book of Margery Kempe, considered to be the first autobiography written in English, presents the story of a woman whose life is guided by visions of, and conversations with, God. By recounting her holy visions, she gains authority with Church officials and is able to travel widely across the known world. Margery (ca. 1373 1440) is certainly an atypical woman1; she pays her husband's debts (Kempe, 60), composes her own autobiography despite illiteracy, and travels extensively without constant companionship of her husband. As James Brundage notes, medieval women  regardless of their social class  tended to live most of their lives in their homes (Brundage, 493), so to travel outside of England was quite an accomplishment on its own. In this context, and with the consideration of her self-description as a meek and passive woman, it seems puzzling, at first, that she was able to live such an active life and gain so much authority with Church officials across Europe and even in Jerusalem. This is not, however, the paradox that it may immediately seem to be. In fact, Margery's self-crafting and self-recitation of her divine visions provide the very allowance  both personal and external  that she needs in order to engage with the world as an active participant. Throughout the narration of her incredibly active life, Margery rhetorically creates the sense that she makes no choices of her own, but is instead wholly guided by another  that is, God. Within the language she uses, she strips her own active agency from the narrative. When describing her many meetings with influential people, she writes that she uttered many good words as God would put them into her mind(Kempe, 61). The words she speaks are God's, not her own. Even her abundance of tears come from without herself; she tells the reader that, in a vision, God commanded, you may not have tears & except when God will send them to you, for they are the free gifts of God, distinct from your merit (66). From the beginning of The Book, Margery describes inhabitation or possession; her hysteria and sinful nature are caused by the presence of an inner demon who acts upon her. She posits a simple cause-and-effect relationship for her actions: [T]he devils called out to her with great threats, and bade her that she should forsake her Christian faith and belief, and deny her God, his mother, and all the saints in heaven, her good works and all good virtues, her father, her mother, and all her friends. And so she did. [&] just as the spirits tempted her to say and do, so she said and did (42). Here, Margery narrates her obedience to the commands of her possessors. Despite the costs  God, family, virtue  she explains that she does exactly what was asked of her, with no objection. She is a being who is fully under another's control. Even in her pious life, her piety is not for any specific choice she makes, but because Christ had worked his grace in her (43) and gave her great devotion (108). She fits this narrative perfectly into the model set before her of how to receive visions: almost all of her advisors tell her to be obedient to the will of our Lord and fulfill with all her might whatever he put[s] into her soul (78), and to be humble and meek (80) in her role as a medium. As Margery describes it, her life includes very little deliberate agency, and consists of obedience, rather than choice. Margery goes even further than demonstrating voluntary obedience  she explains that, even if she wanted to exercise control over her own actions, it would not be possible. In Jerusalem, she could not keep herself from crying and roaring though she should have died for it, and that she fell down because she could not stand or kneel, but writhed and wrestled with her body 2 (104). In her telling, she is not responsible for her tears, convulsions, her physical responses, because they come not from herself. The reader is led to conceive of her as a vessel for God's choices, with no available means or alternatives to what He wants of her. Even her obedience is inactive and in no way volitional. She does not even own the fundamental self-control that allows the agency of choice. This image, however, is self-consciously crafted. Margery narrates in the third person and refers to herself only as the creature, distancing herself from the act of composing the manuscript. This creates rhetorical distance from the kind of narcissistic authority that is often found in autobiographical writings, and would undermine her position as an obedient conduit for God's word. The phrase the creature implies an artistic act external to that creature  there is a creator, God, and a created-one, Margery. With each self-reference as such, she implicitly emphasizes that the relevant artistic act is not of a narrative, not of an autobiography, but of the ultimate act of creation: human life. Whatever her motives for this self-naming,3 the result is that attention is diverted from the inherently active nature of composing a text, and Margery is, again, the passive object of creation, rather than the active subject of her own autobiography and life. If we reconceive her rhetorical crafting of this story, we can read the shifted agency not as essential female passivity, but as a way for an illiterate medieval woman to gain control over aspects of her life. Because she is not responsible for her actions, nothing that she does or says can be her fault. Those who criticize her actions or physical responses are immediately cast as heretical; her word is inseparable from the word of God. She has permission to travel widely in God's name, to speak with Church officials in private chambers, even to challenge their own piety to their faces.4 Margery's critics malign her for wearing all white, but she reports that God tells her, you shall dress according to my will (67) and that she dared not do otherwise than as she was commanded in her soul (68). Through reporting her vision, she can actively counter the assumption that she is a troublesome, self-intentioned woman, and provide divine documentation that she is, instead, fulfilling the proper role for a medieval woman: obedience. For a reader or companion who shares her values, this obedience is necessarily lauded as obedience to God, despite her overt and insistent disobedience to her male companions. Her vision frees her from the burden of self-responsibility or accountability for this earthly disobedience. Divine authority also allows her to offer rebuttals, such as when a Bishop tells her to wait to return from Jerusalem to take her vow of chastity, and she counters his assessment as she had been commanded [by the Lord] (70-71). The narration of her visions gives her permission to act in a strikingly forward manner, despite the veneer of being a mere, meek receptacle. Margery's manner of telling is also a strategy by which she accesses control over her audience from within the text. She massages the reader's perception, deliberately guiding them to a sense of her as pious and obedient, even when the underlying facts belie that impression. The most overt example of textual manipulation in her Book is a parenthetical note at the close of the sixteenth chapter, which says, Read first the twenty-first chapter and then this chapter after that (73). To the modern reader  and likely to one of her contemporary literate readers  this is a crude stylistic device. But in as disjointed and episodic a text as this one, in which there is no overarching literary form, such fashioning must be considered as a deliberate and thoughtful attempt at rhetorical manipulation. With the textual leap to chapter twenty-one comes the announcement of a seemingly abrupt pregnancy, perhaps meant to evoke an immaculate conception. This pregnancy, in fact, begins with a divine annunciation, much like the Biblical Immaculate Conception. In a revelation, our Lord said to [Margery], Daughter, you are with child (84). The chapter proceeds through a vision in which Margery communes with God and the Virgin Mary, who both praise Margery for her pregnancy. God tells her that this pregnancy is no sin, and they both laud her and validate this conception (84-85). Margery, in this vision, is aligned directly with Mary Magdalene [&] Mary of Egypt, St Paul, and many other saints that are now in heaven, and less directly  through repeated mentions of God's own blessed mother  the Virgin Mary (85). These reminders of the Virgin Birth and praise of Margery's virtue blatantly demonstrate to the reader that God Himself considers this conception a blessing. Chapter seventeen tells a different story, however. In the very first sentence of the chapter, Margery writes of giving birth to her other children and of a visit from God in which He tells her that she should bear no more children (73). This seemingly unequivocal decree, though, seems all but irrelevant by the time the reader finally returns to chapter seventeen. By crafting the reader's movement through the text, Margery virtually bypasses this information without omission. She skips reminding the reader of her previous children  the reference of which would undermine the effect of the rhetorically abrupt pregnancy as well as the correlation to the Virgin Mary  and also prepares the reader for her becoming pregnant before revealing that Jesus commanded her not to. The reader already knows how happy God is to see Margery with child at the point that he or she reads the commandment not to become pregnant again. By interrupting the chronology of this narrative, Margery avoids presenting herself as disobedient of God's commandment not to bear any more children, as she undoubtedly would if the events were placed in their proper chronology. Beyond a rhetorical level, Margery's visions also benefit her own emotional life. One function of her visions is that they allow her to develop an interpersonally intimate relationship that is more symbiotic than her relationship with her husband. The kindest words Margery has for her husband come in the first chapter, when she says that he always had tenderness and compassion for her (43). After this, however, he is not presented as an emotional mate, but rather as a barrier to her holiness, insisting that they have sexual encounters against her will. When she refuses, he tells her, You are no good wife (58). At one point on her travels simply writes she did not know where her husband had gone (64). He largely falls into the background of her story, literally disappearing for years. In an early conversation with God, she says that she would choose her priest as her companion to heaven more than [her] own father or [her] husband (55). From this, it is fair to assume that Margery and her husband had a tense, possibly even antagonistic, relationship, as she likely saw him as the embodiment of her sexual sins, even as someone who would be willing to put her life at risk for his own sexual pleasures,5 and for his part, we at least know that he expects more from her in fulfilling the obligations of marriage. Medieval marriages were not necessarily loveless,6 but love was not requisite to the marriage, and tended to grow out of the conjugal debts, according to John T. Noonan, who quotes Thomas: a man loves his wife principally by reason of the carnal meeting (Noonan, 255). The carnal meetings that Margery and her husband share, however, do not strengthen Margery's relationship with her husband, and rather than contributing to a developing love, they are a source of anguish and tension. In contrast, Margery's visions bring her into a symbiosis with God that is more akin to the language and sentiment of marriage than anything she speaks of her husband. In her visions, she and Christ are bonded. God expresses to her many times that they are a unit, saying, I am in you, and you in me (Kempe, 57). This is a statement that can be read as sexual, Eucharistic, and also familial. To integrate all three of these modes of reading this complicated image, the repeating image is simply that of mutual communion with the Lord, in which He is just as eager to take her body into His. The reciprocity of their relationship even inverts the directionality of expected devotional writing (in which Margery would promise penance to God), and Margery narrates that God tells her, if it were possible for me to suffer pain again as I have done before, I would rather suffer as much as I ever did for your soul alone, rather than that you should be separated from me without end (65-66). The singularity  and emotional dependence  with which God devotes Himself to Margery is as startling as it is affectionate. He tells her that wherever she goes, he go[es] with her, including both to church and to bed; their togetherness spans both night and day (66). This resembles a domestic marriage more than it resembles the expected Christian understanding of God's devotion to mankind. Noonan, citing a 13th century monk and theologian, writes, In marriage there is a certain singleness of love in which an outsider does not share & There is mutual love and therefore mutual zeal, and therefore singleness (Noonan, 256). This is entirely consistent with Margery's narration of God's expressions of love to her. God tells her that she is a love unlike any other (86). He repeats the word singular many times to describe how particularized his love for her is, as she is his own blessed spouse (88). God expresses a mutual and singular love for Margery, giving her access to a mutually beneficial and enriching relationship that she would otherwise not have. The benefits of such a relationship are not found in any text, but are arguably located within Margery's continued energy and determination to continue on her journey. Margery not only allows herself to feel loved and cared for through her visions, she also finds emotional validation and familial comfort from heavenly voices. When she feels inadequate or fears that she is in danger, a holy voice intervenes to soothe her. While fearing attack on her travels, God says to her with paternal assurance, Don't be afraid, daughter, your party will come to no harm while you are in their company (98). St. Anne and Elizabeth also refer to her as daughter in an anxious moment, Anne telling the disheartened Margery, I am well pleased with your service, and Elizabeth, it seems to me that you do your duty very well (53). God enters when Margery doubts herself, and tells her that he loves her, or that she has no reason to be afraid or troubled. Within the narrative, Margery is calmed by these familial and intimate appeals, and on another level, they provide divine authority that Margery very rarely does wrong in the eyes of God. Her visions are soothing voices, quelling her angst about her own life  and serving the additional purpose of convincing the reader that her angst and self-criticism are unfounded. Margery's state of mind is relevant in that the visions provide her with an internal opportunity to circumvent the messages she receives from many external critics of her devotion and lifestyle. Along her spiritual journey, skeptics and believers alike question her and her visions. Even the priest who served as the scribe of her book finds it necessary to test her feelings, and for a long time would not always give credence to her words (91). She repeatedly has to persuade those whom she meets to believe her. One of her confessors is very sharp with [her, and] considers [her visions] merely trifles and jokes (80). The assumption going into a situation with unfamiliar people is that they will not believe [her] words, which results in this creature [Margery] suffer[ing] a great deal of tribulation and unhappiness (81) because of the difficult nature of being a self-proclaimed mystic. Without the emotional security from the visions, Margery would likely not have the boldness and endurance to continue to do so. The validation she receives from the visions, then, can be read as responses of empowerment to continue living her life as she has been: she affirms from within that she is doing the right thing and has the emotional support and singular love of God. From a critical standpoint, it is worth examining what Margery has to gain from these visions, even for a wholly trusting reader. The content and rhetoric of the visions tend to cohere into an extremely self-serving model, even in moments when Margery describes her own overwhelming misery. Through envisioning a complex familial, sexual, and devotional relationship with God, Margery gives herself permission to love, to do, and to feel. More tangibly, Margery's visions allow her to lead an active life, to travel and engage in significant theological discourses with important people, to have influence on people's faith, and to grant herself her own emotion fulfillment  all while fitting her behavior into the expectation that she should be, above all else, obedient and passive. If we were to extend the hypothesis into the purely speculative, and assume briefly that Margery is fully conscious of the crafting of her story with only selfish motivations, the means by which she achieved the desired ends would be incredibly close  if not identical  to what she narrates in her Book. Working within the prescribed role of obedience to God, she finds incredible self-assurance, activity, and self-possession. However, even without assuming such a fundamental dishonesty on Margery's part, it is fair to presume that these visions were  even subconsciously  a self-fashioned way of entering and engaging with the world in a more desirable way.

ENG.G0.44.1,Eve's Understanding of Natural Patriarchy in Paradise Lost,English,Argumentative Essay,"John Milton invokes the aide of a muse at the beginning of his epic poem Paradise Lost in order to help him navigate his expansion upon the Biblical tale of the Fall of Man from the Garden of Eden. Fully aware of the enormity of the task before him, Milton asked for personal divination in order to assert Eternal Providence, / And justify the ways of God to men (25-26).1 Miltons voice is unmistakably present within the story of Eves fall as the Biblical text does not provide sufficient dramatic details for his purpose. Through the evolving nature of Eves character and her understanding of Gods purpose for her through Adam, Milton subtly comments on the essentiality of patriarchy and the inadequacies of women. Even though her self awareness develops in Paradise, the resolution of the Fall results in her return to inferiority and complete dependence upon her husband by her own accord. In Book IV of Paradise Lost, Satan enters Paradise and nostalgically admires the beauty around him. As the narrator relates his observations of the first humans, his attention is drawn to their relationship as man and woman. The narrator separates them as he explains that though both Not equal, as thir sex not equal seemd; For contemplation hee and valor formd, For softness shee and sweet attractive Grace, Hee for God only, shee for God in him (295-299). He qualifies his statement by stating that their sexes did not seem equal [my italics added]. Because the narrator does not absolutely understand the equality of man and woman, an initial doubt is instilled in the reader regarding the credibility of this comprehension. While this is not reconciled but instead glossed over, this seeming lack of his understanding makes the unequal nature of their relationship active and tentative. Adam and Eves sex here is not defined as secondary physical sexual characteristics or their genetic assignment as man and woman, leaving the interpretation up to the reader. If the inequality is founded upon on secondary sexual characteristics, then their division is based on superficial distinctions that comments on womans body as the defining factor in her subservience to man. This further suggests that if a woman has pronounced sexual characteristics and great beauty, then she is more inferior to man than a more androgynous woman. On the other hand, if the narrator is referring to their genetic sex as the limiting factor, then their division is based completely upon human design and every woman is equally inferior to man regardless of her physical or internal attributes. Milton maintains the site of distinction between man and woman as sexuality. Adam, as the narrator asserts, was created for contemplation and valor, whereas Eve was made for softness and sweet attractive Grace (297-298). The dissimilarity between their purposed creations is striking and definitive. The characteristics for which Adam was created are stereotypical of the alpha male patriarch as intellect and valor are traditional and respected masculine traits. Contemplation and intellect reflect the Protestant admiration and concern with education as influenced by the Protestant Reformation. Adam, then, is the Protestant male archetype by creation. The purpose for which Eve was created does not refer to internal characteristics and aspirations as it did with Adam but to her physical nature and beauty, eternally demeaning her. Soft beauty is depicted as the quintessential physical splendor and focuses on delicacy. Her sweet attractive Grace, however, adds a commanding dimension to Eve as Grace is one of the greatest Christian attributes. Grace is understood through the Protestant tradition as Gods loving kindness, especially as related to atonement of sins through Jesus Christ. Even though Eve was created in part for her beauty, she is also given this powerful role which reflects Miltons modification of the traditional construction of patriarchy. Milton struggles with this tension of patriarchy as he oscillates between damning Eve and exploring her voice. Adam, as Satan continues, was created for God whereas Eve was created for God in him (Adam): Hee for God only, shee for God in him (299). The division between man and woman is declared didactically as man being the conduit for womans relationship and understanding of God, giving man absolute rule over womans spiritual life. This patriarchal hierarchy appears to be naturally designed in Paradise and suggests that male domination and female subservience is natural and divine order. The purpose for which Eve was created foreshadows the source of Adams Fall as well as her eventual need for Grace and atonement. As Eves journey in Paradise begins, so too does her understanding of her position in Paradise and in Gods design. Satan observes and relates Adam and Eves first dialogue exchange as they end their first day together. Adam is first heard modeling for Eve how to praise God and the importance of doing so. He then immediately moves into a lecture about the rules of Paradise. From the very beginning, man is responsible for showing woman how to talk to God and setting the boundaries. The relationship between praising God through words and through following His rules emphasizes the need for obedience by woman. Woman must be obedient in praising God properly as Adam did and also by following the rules that Adam relates. In order to be obedient to God, Eve must be obedient to Adam, thus knowing God through Adam. In this transfer of obedience, Eve is always inferior to a male figure. Adam refers to Eve as his sole partner and sole part of all these joys / dearer thyself than all, which foreshadows what will become his major flaw, his view of Eve as his completion. While this romantic and wedded speech demonstrates the love between the two first humans, Eves address to Adam is more submissive and mortal. Eve refers to Adam as for whom / And from whom I was formd flesh of thy flesh, / And without whom am to no end, my Guide / And Head and honors his statements: what thou hast said is just and right (440-443). She understands him as her guide and her intellect, confirming the purpose Satan relayed for Adams creation. After mimicking Adams language and also praising God, Eve relates her birth narrative to Adam in an attempt to take ownership of her language. Eves first thought, as she narrates, was where / And what [she] was, whence thither brought and how, demonstrating that she had free thought even from creation. Her creation, though, foregoes the normal development of a newborn to an adult and she begins her life as a fully cognitive and aware adult. As she explored the land, she found a stream where she admired her physical beauty. She was pleased with the shadow that returned her stare and pind with vain desire until God warned her not to slip into sin (466). This first experience with her beauty is a warning sign that alludes to the future Fall. Within the first moments of her life, Eve has been drawn to sin of the flesh. God suggests that if she does not look upon herself and follows Him, then she will not stray; however, Adam will look upon Eves beauty every day and that will be his fall. After God asks Eve to follow Him, she responds, what could I do, / But follow straight, invisibly thus led? (475-476). Following blindly behind a her Maker, Eve positions herself in a subservient position. Even though she did not know of any other way to live in this new world, the construction of this scene creates a commentary on womans need to follow a person of higher social standing in order to survive and the importance of education and logic to prevent blind following. There is a poignant irony in Eves birth narrative as she dominates the speaking in comparison to her husband. One could interpret Eves zealous and loquacious speech as her attempt to compensate for her inadequacies by female birth. Even though she shows her husband that she owns her birth narrative, she still wanted Adam in her company when she told the story. This couples her struggle to understand her inferior role as a woman and her love and appreciation for Adam as her other half. As Eve concludes her birth narrative, she romantically and gracefully recalls seeing Adam for the first time: Part of my Soul I seek thee, and thee claim My other half: with that thy gentle hand Seizd mine, I yielded, and from that time see How beauty is excelld by manly grace And wisdom, which alone is truly fair (487-491). Eves understanding and recognition of Adam as the one from whom she was created surpasses common intellect. She was not told of how she was created, but in Adam she recognized part of herself. This union of their beings is reflected in her description of beauty [being] excelld by manly grace (490). Eve is taking the traits of beauty and grace for which she was designed and attributing them to Adam by stating that Adams grace is greater than her beauty. Because of this move, she is honoring him at the same time as she positions herself as the giver of attributions. She willingly makes the two qualities for which she was created diminutive to Adams characteristics. At the same time, however, she is telling him that they are one in the same and acknowledging that she is part of him. Adam and Eve remain obedient to their design as they act and speak in accordance with the purposes for which they were made. Adam is the intellectual rule relater and Eve is the fragile beauty; thus is Gods blueprint: so God ordains, / God is thy Law, thou mine: to know no more / Is womans happiest knowledge and her praise (636-638). Eve reiterates here that God is Adams ruler and Adam is Eves ruler. In this understanding of the order of power, both Adam and Eve are subordinate to a higher power and are both debased. The degree to which each is subordinated is dependent upon gender, though, and emphasizes Miltons modification of the traditional patriarchy as even man is inferior to God. Another one of Gods intentions was that Adam and Eve could help themselves to anything in Paradise except the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil. Because Eve had some of Adams characteristics in her, she tried to use her intellect to be more productive in work; however, because she did not have the full amount of contemplation that Adam was bestowed, her logic was doomed. In Book IX, Adam and Eve begin another day of labor in Paradise in which both Adam and Eve work in the garden. In this utopian society, Eve is expected to work as Adam does, creating dissonance in the qualities of this man-run Eden. Within this tension, Eve struggles to understand where her feminine role ends and where Adams role begins. As Eve accounts what is left to do, she suggests, Let us divide our labors, thou where choice / Leads thee, or where most needs&/ while I In yonder Spring of Roses intermixt (214-218). She assures him that they will be able to see each other and interact but that our days work brought to little, though begun / Early (224-225). Eve tries to assume the role of the authoritarian delegator here but Adams response mocks her for her fruitless attempt to act as a man. He turns his mocking into a patronizingly response which praises her for her intellectual attempt and claims that there is nothing lovelier&/ In Woman, than to study household good, / And good works in her Husband to promote (232-234). Adams comment removes Eve from the spotlight and puts his superiority back into the focus of her self-understanding; the husband is the one to do the work and is the primary actor in all decisions. Even though a woman can study the household good, the man takes those observations of the woman and promotes them for his own betterment and purpose. He continues by reminding her that there is a malicious Foe / Envying our happiness and that it would be most prudent to stay together to protect each other (253-254). Adams didactic nature continues by concluding his argument: The Wife, where danger or dishonor lurks, / Safest and seemliest by her Husband stays / Who guards her, or with her the worst endures (267-269). By suggesting that women are frail and unsafe to be left alone, Milton is suggesting through Adams voice that men must protect women and women should always stay by her husbands side. Through Adams chastising, Eve is being punished for acting too much like Adam and yet not having the level of intellect that Adam possesses. Stuck in this middle ground between acting like Adam and not representing him well enough, Eves understanding of herself becomes compromised. Miltons moralizing use of Adam and Eves dialogue to comment on the natural character of patriarchy is emulated in the climactic Fall of Man. According to Miltons elaboration in Paradise Lost, Eve eats the fruit from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil by the Satan serpents questioning of Eve; Eve caused her own fall. The Satan serpent tells Eve that he has touchd and tasted, yet both live, / And life more perfet have attaind than Fate / Meant mee, by ventring higher than my Lot which implies that because he had not died from eating the fruit, Eve wouldnt either (688-690). By suggesting that seeing is believing, the Satan serpent tempts Eve into one of the greatest questions that Jesus Christ will teach his followers in the distant Biblical future. Jesus Christ proclaimed, Blessed are they who have not seen, and yet have believed (King James Bible, John 20:29). This verse would have been known by the readers of Paradise Lost and Eves failure in believing that the fruit will not harm her by seeing the Satan serpent still alive would create discomfort in the knowledgeable reader. Milton even accounts that his [Satans] words replete with guile / Into her heart too easy entrance won and implies that if Eve had more of Adams contemplation and valor, she would not have fallen for her false logic (733-734). Once again, Eve is reprimanded for not representing Adam well enough. As Eve tries to rationalize what she is seeing, she assumes that she and the Satan serpent are equal and that the effect of the fruit will be the same: In the day we eat Of this fair Fruit, our doom is, we shall die. >How dies the Serpent? hee hath eatn and lives, And knows, and speaks, and reasons, and discerns, Irrational till then. (762-766) Just before she eats the fruit, she pushes her rationalization into ambition to know virtue to make wise, and to thereby be more like her husband who has the cognitive abilities that she lacks (778). Even though the abilities with which Adam was created are markedly different from the knowledge gained from eating the forbidden fruit, the inference is that Eve wanted to know more. This desire for greater understanding suggests that she was not satisfied with her current gifts from God and therein, coupled with flawed logic and ambition, present the reason for Eves fall. After Adam eats of the same fruit as Eve, they begin to quarrel and Adam places the entire blame upon Eve. He chastises her for not listening to him and says that this could have been prevented if she only stayed by his side. Eves response transfers the blame onto a hypothetical situation as she tries to bring her husband to her level: hadst thou been there / Or here th attempt, thou couldst not have discernd / Fraud in the Serpent speaking as he spake (1148-1150). In her explanation to Adam, Eve claims that Adam would have fallen for the same deceptive trap that Satan set for Eve. Adams contemplation and intellect is being challenged by his wife, but Adam does not allow her bold remarks to remain unchallenged. Adam claims that he did everything he could: I warnd thee, I admonsishd thee, foretold / The Danger...And perhaps / I also errd in overmuch admiring / What seemd in thee so perfet (1171-72, 1177-79). He had fallen for the passion he felt for Eves beauty, her natural beauty was the cause of his fall. Milton uses Adam here as an enlightening model for his commentary on patriarchy as Adam finishes his response to Eve by saying that Thus ist shall befall / Him who to worth in Woman overtrusting / Lets her Will rule and that womans first indulgence in the presence of evil will be her husband (1182-1184). At the end of Book IX, Adam has these final words and Eves silence comments boldly about the power of Adams words and the invitation to the reader to contemplate the influence of will in patriarchy. The angel Michael spends a considerable amount of time showing Adam the future turmoil and struggle of humankind as a result of his and Eves fall. When Michael instructs Adam to share what he has learned with Eve, Eve tells Adam that God has shared with her the very same information he had learned from Michael. Even though Adam cast Eve away when he saw the angel Michael coming down from heaven, Eve is on the same level of awareness as Adam. In a sense, God has made Eve equal to Adam through her dreams, but not in her conscious life. If the drama ended here, Eve would have developed into an intellectual equal of Adam under Gods eyes; however, Eve continues and willingly degrades herself because of her obedience and devotion to her husband through whom she knows God. She remarks: But now lead on; In me is no delay; with thee to go, Is to stay here; without thee here to stay, Is to go hence unwilling; thou to mee Art all things under Heavn, all places thou (614-618). In this final speech of the epic poem, Eve returns to the natural order and design by which God created her. This positioning has become her choice and she has chosen patriarchy by which to live. Milton infers that this is the proper choice to make as women, to be inferior to man but to always walk by mans side, as Adam and Eve go hand in hand&[on] their solitary way, at the end of the poem (648-449). The resolution is peaceful and as such, Milton maintains his instructive style in the proper behavior of women through the Mother of the Human Race, Eve. Miltons sexual politics and construction of patriarchy are emulated through the character and evolution of Eve. Eve understands herself and her role as a woman through her interactions with Adam. Even though Eve has moments of power, she eventually resigns herself to a submissive and inferior position. This decision was hers as we have seen through her self-discovery; after all, God created free will and for Eve to be a slave to patriarchy would be to impugn Gods dignity. In order for Paradise to be regained, humans must choose patriarchy as the restoration of order.

ENG.G0.45.1,Charity in Sir Thornhill,English,Argumentative Essay,"In the novel, The Vicar of Wakefield by Oliver Goldsmith, one man describes Sir William Thornhill as a man who has the first character in the kingdom for every thing that is just and good (136). Others, throughout the novel, make similar protestations of his goodness. However, for a character supposedly so good and decent, he does not take the actions he should in preventing his friends, the Primroses, downfall. Similarly, he does not show as many instances of charity one would expect from someone considered so charitable (19). By taking a closer look at Sir Williams character, it is clear that he is not as deserving as everyone in the novel believes he is of the many kind descriptions attributed to him, and as a friend, he leaves much to be desired. Sir William states of himself, At present, his bounties are more rational and moderate than before; but still he preserves the character of an humourist, and finds most pleasure in eccentric virtues (20). Yet, after having not given up charity completely when realizing his previous mistakes, it is hard to understand why Sir William would not show more charity to his friends, the Primroses, especially since right after their meeting the Vicar tells him of their late misfortunes (18). In fact, other than saving Sophia, an act that actually requires no charity, saving a dog stealer, and the money he spends at the end of the novel, he performs no charitable acts. All of the charity ascribed to him was done in the past, and for a man supposedly given to reckless charity, it is hard to believe there would not be more instances with regards to his new friends. In addition to hardly showing charity to his friends, he takes from them. It would be one thing if he went around masquerading as poor while never taking from others less fortunate than himself, but he does take from others. When Sir William is first seen in the novel, he is asking for money from the inn keeper and then after being denied, is given money by the Vicar (18). These people all have less than he does so it seems unkind to accept from them money that they need more than he does, especially when the Vicar has six children. Sir William states that he is glad that a late oversight in giving what money I had about me, has shewn me that there are still some men like you (18). Surely, though, he could observe charity in the world while still not taking from others. Later, as his visits to the Primroses become more frequent, he begins helping them in the field, which to a degree makes up for his taking from them, yet it is hard to believe he would not offer more to them than gingerbread and boxes, especially given the many hardships the family faces as the novel progresses (54). While these instances are important in noting how is character is not quite as worthy of the titles he is given, they in no way proves it as much as his unkindness to the Primrose family does in not taking further means to prevent Olivia from being seduced by his nephew, Mr. Thornhill. At the end, Sir Williams says to the Vicar, It is impossible&that I should forgive you, as you never deserved my resentment. I partly saw your delusion then, and as it was out of my power to restrain, I could only pity it! (149). This is not true. It was certainly not out of his power to restrain (149). He could have done any number of things to prevent this from happening. Sir William could have further told the Primroses of Mr. Thornhills villainy, or he could have revealed himself as Sir William if they needed further proof, or he could have simply forbid his nephew from acting the way he acted or cut off his money. Surely, by then he had known enough of the Primroses benevolence to give up his masquerade for something as important as saving their daughter. The fact that he did not and only pitied them is both cruel and selfish. A truly charitable person would go out of their way no matter what the cost to save friends. This seduction and removal from her family was no small matter. It was only by chance that the Vicar found Olivia. What if she had not made it back? What if she had starved to death? The danger to more than just her character was simply too high for Sir William to ignore, although saving her character alone still should have been enough to induce him to intervene. Furthermore, if his refusal to take further measures was only out of indignation because of his previous fight with the family, or to teach them a lesson, then is was too unkind a lesson. Sir William says at the end of the novel, of his nephews actions, Good heavens! How every new discovery alarms me, which could provide proof that he did not know the lengths to which his nephew would go to satisfy his lust, but that is hard to believe as well (158). Olivia says to her father that Sir William took every opportunity of privately admonishing me against the artifices of Mr. Thornhill, who I now find was even worse than he represented him (109). Knowing that Mr. Thornhill had artifices at all makes it hard to accept that Sir William did not know the full length of his nephews artifices (109). Even if he did not know the full lengths to which Mr. Thornhill would go, there is really no acceptable length for letting someone, let alone a friend, be fooled. In other words, apprehensions are apprehensions and no matter how small, if he had reason to believe something bad would happen then that should have been enough to persuade him to take a stronger course of action. He should have also notified the entire family of Mr. Thornhills character. If Olivia was in love with Mr. Thornhill, then it is not hard to believe that she would not act on or believe his warnings. Granted his letter did show the Primroses his disagreement with Olivia and Sophias trip to London, but he did not explain or defend his actions, and it is natural that they should think his disagreement was based on his love for Sophia (68-69). Furthermore, the Vicar states, So saying, I threw him his pocket-book, which he took up with a smile, and shutting the clasps with the utmost composure, left us, quite astonished at the serenity of his assurance (68). It is hard to believe him kind when he smiles, because he knows they do not know all that he does about Thornhills character; therefore, he has to suspect that something bad might happen. In addition to that, it is hard to believe a true friend would leave people he cares about so easily and without defending his actions. It seems as though that would have been the perfect time to reveal his true identity, saving everyone so much pain. There is other proof throughout the novel that Sir William knew more about his nephew than he leads on at the end. For example, when George goes to get help from Sir William after having fought in a duel for Mr. Thornhill, Sir William calls him the instrument of his vices (97). This means that not only does he know his nephew gets into duels, but he then must also know there is a reason behind all of these duels. Furthermore, Sir Williams lack of surprise at someone like George showing up and asking for help further confirms he knows what types of things his nephew gets into. In addition to this instance, Sir William repeatedly says fudge! to the two ladies employed by Mr. Thornhill to deceive the Primroses. Although he might be saying, fudge, because he does not care for their characters or because he does not want the Primroses to believe them and go to town with them, and not because he does knows who they really are, it is uncertain. Yet, given how much he knows about his nephews business in terms of his nephews marriage and the role Sir William plays in that marriage by drawing up the papers, it is therefore easy to assume that he might know a great deal more about what his nephew does and who visits him (161). Similarly, not being all the time under the guise of Burchell, he also must know who is of rank and who is not, which means it is plausible he could know all along these ladies are not who they claim to be. If that is the indeed the case, then he should have been more upfront about it to the Primroses, because that would be a great injustice towards them on his part. Sir Williams says, I am now come to see justice done a worthy man, for whom I have the most esteem. I have long been a disguised spectator of thy fathers benevolence (152). Having said that, it is hard to then understand why, when he goes to such lengths to state his reverence for the Vicar and after warning Olivia about his nephew, he then goes to such lengths to protect Mr. Thornhill (155-156). Naturally, he could feel it is his duty as an uncle, but after discrediting his nephew and proclaiming his friendship to the Primroses, it does not make sense. His inconsistency in his support of his nephew is confusing, and it seems he would be more apt to favor the Primroses, since all along any unkindness they showed him was out of fear of his threatening their daughters chances at making good marriages, which was something they greatly needed to get by, which as a man of class, he would know. Lastly, as a man whose character for every virtue was universal, yet just, Sir William does not act anywhere near as kind or just as the Vicar does (97). It is as though the Vicar is more deserving of Sir Williams praises. For his example, where Sir William seems unwilling to do his friends the kindness of fully revealing his nephews character, the Vicar is not unwilling. He sends a letter right away to Miss Wilmot to save her from marrying him (117). In addition to this, the Vicar has to insist that Sir William be more forgiving towards his nephew: Sir William was going to spurn him away, but at my request he raised him& (165). Certainly, in the novel, the Primroses vanity and quest to be better than they really are, are to be blamed for what happens to them. Even so, as a self- proclaimed friend and widely proclaimed good man, Sir William should have taken better care of them and better care to prevent bad things from happening to them. When a friend knows something that could prevent his friends from impending calamity, then that friend does whatever he can to ensure his friends safety. Sir William does not follow this rule. He lets his friends walk right into danger, and no one who is actually charitable would do that.

ENG.G0.46.1,"With Magic Comes Power: Exploring Marlowe's ""Doctor Faustus"" and Shakespeare's ""The Tempest""",English,Argumentative Essay,"When an individual reads Christopher Marlowes The Jew of Malta and then sequentially reads Shakespeares The Merchant of Venice, it would be difficult to argue that the stories did not have an influence on the other. Thematically, the characters of Barabas in The Jew of Malta and Shylock in The Merchant of Venice are ridiculed for being the religious other (in fact, for both being Jewish) and both seek vengeance on their Christian counterparts. The similarities are too obvious to be overlooked, however, these two characters also demonstrate differences in their humanitywhereas Barabas seeks the power that accompanies wealth, Shylock desires respect of the Venetians. The two stories diverge from the seemingly similar plot structures they portray, and in the end, produce original works that are reminiscent of each other while still maintaining their own authentic complexities. Marlowes Tragical History of Doctor Faustus and Shakespeares The Tempest follow this paradigm as well. More specifically, although Faustus and Prospero demonstrate similarities in relation to their intellectual desires and cravings for possessed magic and the power that accompanies it, Marlowe exhibits Faustus unwavering anti-Christian perspective and decision to obtain diabolic power while Shakespeare demonstrates Prosperos decisive transition to renounce his art and embrace humanism. Within the first lines that Faustus speaks, the reader becomes aware of the Faustus intellectual quest for knowledge. Throughout his life, he has studied and mastered Aristotles works (Marlowe 1.5) of philosophy, the field of medicine to become a physician (1.15), and the universal body of law (1.35). These fields of intellect, however, are not adequate for Faustus. Faustus desires a world of profit and delight/of power, of honor of omnipotence (1.53-54) and through Faustus logic, the only way in which this may be obtained is in becoming a studious artisan (2.55) and practice necromancy. Along with this, Faustus denounces Christianity and its divinity, paraphrasing half a verse from scripture and deducting that we must sin/And so consequently die (1.45-46). Marlowe expresses Faustus logic on the inadequacy of worldly knowledge explaining that the only solution is to become a sound magician for he is a mighty god (1.62). Faustus quest of ultimate knowledge goes beyond the humanly intellect as he cannot see past the triviality of these subjects. His search for knowledge leads him to the solution of demonic magicwhich ultimately leads to his eternal damnation. Prospero, too, shares this quest of knowledge with Faustus. In Prosperos first conversation with his daughter Miranda, the reader discovers the reason why Prospero was banished as the Duke of Milan: In dignity, and for the liberal arts/Without parallel; those being all my study&I thus neglecting my worldly ends, all dedicated to closeness and the bettering of my mind (Shakespeare I.ii. 73-74, 89-90). Like Faustus, Prospero seeks knowledge to the fullest extent, and by doing so, he neglected his duties as a duke and was overthrown by his brother. However, unlike Faustus, Prospero does not find triviality in human subjects, and it is through this laborious study of liberal arts that he is able to obtain magic. Caliban explains that if one can possess his books; for without them/He is but a sot (III.ii.92-93). The books that Caliban is referring to represent those given to him by Gonzalo as he was banished (I.ii.166-168). It is true that the island allows him to have the power of magic, but it is only through his study that he is able to control it. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the nature of Prosperos art differs extensively from Faustus. He does not call up evil spirits or jeopardize his morality in order to control. In fact, when Miranda asks how they came to ashore, Prospero replies By Providence divine (I.ii.159). Where Prospero still believes in this divine entity, Faustus has abandoned it: Despair in God, and trust in Belzebub (5.5) and relies on his own power and the power of the diabolic. Shakespeare illustrates to the reader that the magic in which Prospero gains is unlike Faustus, and that his religious morality is still intact. However, with saying this, it is important to note that both Prospero and Faustus struggle with the power that accompanies the magic that they obtainbe it demonic, moral, amoral, or spurned from a magical island. Faustus struggle to give up his magic and power lies within two principles in which he cannot break away from. Primarily, this struggle lies within his unwillingness to give up his indulgences: Ay, and Faustus will turn to God again. To God? He loves thee not: The god thou servest is thine own appetite (5.9-11). Marlowe demonstrates to the reader that Faustus is disinclined to abjure his magic because of the amount of pleasure he receives from it, prominent in the scenes in which he plays practical jokes on the pope, friar, and horse-courser and also through his sexual desire with Helen of Troy. However, the reader also becomes aware of Faustus skepticism in terms of the validity of hell as a reason for Faustus objection to renounce his magic. As Faustus explains to Mephastophilis that Come, I think hell is a fable (5.126), the reader becomes aware of Faustus negligence to fully repent, even after various opportunities with the Good Angel. Although Lucifer agrees with the condition that Mephastophilis shall do for him, and bring him whatever (5.99-100) Faustus misunderstands Mephastophilis explanation that there is a hell, and that Hell hath no limits, nor is circumscribed (5.120). In this perspective, Mephastophilis grants him a valid answer just as he wishes for in his pactthat there is a hell and that there is no place for it, just a state of being. Therefore, although the reader may want to reduce Faustus as an immoral and ignorant character at this point, the reader must comprehend that through Faustus overwhelming power, he fails to understand Mephastophilis message. Although given that there is a hell, Faustus own power and intellect clouds his mind, and therefore he does not feel the need to surrender such magic. Prospero also struggles with sacrificing his power, and like Faustus, becomes too comfortable in the power that he possesses. Prosperos magic prompted the tempest itself, as Miranda expresses If by your art, my dearest father, you have/Put the wild waters in this roar, allay them (I.ii.1-2) and the tempest was Prosperos plan to gain his vengeance on his brotherbut only through being able to control the individuals on the island. On the island, the shipwrecked crew from Milan is under his control, and he utilizes his magic and spirits to keep them in his captivity. But it is through his control of the islandand the individuals on it-- that he struggles with his power. Unlike Faustus, who fails to repent and remains unwavering in his perspective on the diabolic magic and power, Prospero undergoes a major transformation in his thoughts on power, exhibited by his speech to Ferdinand in scene IV as he reflects on the plot of Caliban to take his life: Yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve, And like this insubstantial pageant faded Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff As dreams are made on and our little life Is rounded with a sleep. Sir, I am vexd Bear with my weakness, my old brain is troubled (IV.i.154-159). The solemnity, vexation, and troubled nature that Prospero illustrates to the reader in this passage expresses the realization of his role as a humannot as a deity or one who uses magic to controls others. By understanding that he, as a human being, will leave not a rack behind, and eventually perish, leaving no magic or power behind. It is not until now that he comprehends that life is more than vengeance, control, and power. The magic and power that he possesses now will not allow him to be immortal, and rather, he should enjoy his life as his daughter prepares for matrimony. At this point of the play, Prospero faces the human condition and recognizes that he was hindered in the false life of the magical. Although he forgets what it is like to be truly human throughout the course of the play, this passage exemplifies that he has regained this knowledge, knowing that his life is rounded with a sleep and that one day, he will perish, regardless of the magic or power he possesses. Unfortunately for Faustus, this transition or epiphany to relinquish his powers does not occuror, arguably, occurs too late. The complexity of Faustus last soliloquy mirrors the complexity of the magic and power that he has, and also the complex character that he has portrayed. Like Prospero, Faustus realizes that he too, in fact is a human, but his realization only signifies one message-- that he will perish and be eternally damned. Although the reader believes that within the hour he has left to live his last words will ring of repentance, they do not. Surprisingly, Faustus proclaims, One drop would save my soul, half a drop: ah my Christ--/Ah, rend not my heart for naming of my Christ;/ Yet will I call on himO Spare me, Lucifer (13.71-74)! The reader fully expects that Faustus will give his soul to Christ, but in the last clause, alters his mind and stands firmly in the diabolic as he has done throughout the play, proclaiming Spare me, Lucifer! His stanceand consequently, his downfall-- is resolutely rooted in his belief in that the magic and power from Lucifer will save him. However, the complexity continues as the speech draws to a close. Faustus proclaims that This soul should fly from me, and I be changed/Unto some brutish beast:/All beast are happy (13.98-100). The man who proclaims his wish to become a beast is the same man who wished to be mighty god earlier in the work. The responsibility of his magic and power has now come full-circle. In all of his desires, power, and magic, his only desire now is for the powers to free him from his bond with Lucifer. One of the most desperate lines in the play occur in Faustus last words, exemplified by the dashes, pauses, and exclamation points: Ill burn my booksah, Mephastophilis (13.113)! His last words are haunting, not only because of his presumed damnation but also because of the first clauseIll burn my books. In his desperation, did Faustus wish to repent through burning the books of his demonic magic? It seems as though Shakespeare believes so. In one of Prosperos last lines, the rhetoric and diction used is uncannily similar to Faustus last words. Prospero explains that but this rough magic/I here abjure&Ill drown my book (V.i50-51, 57). Again, as Caliban mentioned to his newly-found comrades in Act III, Prosperos books represent his magical art and his power. Although the tones of the lines are much different, Propseros desire to free himself of magic and regain his life lies within his ability to rid himself of his book, and therefore his magic and power that he has on the island that he has resided for years. Prosperos metamorphosis from a sound magician (to use Marlowes phrase) to one concerned with the worldly and humanistic again, occurs with the drowning of his book. Likewise, perhaps Shakespeare is suggesting that by Faustus proclaiming he would burn his book, his repentance too would be inevitable, due to his willingness to surrender his magic and power. It seems almost too perfect that by relinquishing his power in the world of the magical, Prospero gains the worldly power of his dukedom in Milan. The moral of the play seems to echo some of Mephastophilis thoughts, that if something were made for man, therefore is man more excellent (5.185) and more concretely, in the epilogue of the play: Whose deepness doth entice such forward wits/to practice more than heavenly power permits (Epi.7-9). And of course, this is too perfect. As a Christian moral play, Faustus relies on the horror of demonic and diabolic magic and the craving of power (outside the worldly) to be the downfall of our tragic hero. But the reader has to be more aware of the complexities that both protagonistsand playsinstill. Although one can reduce a moral from each story and attempt to minimize a character as moral or immoral, the artistry of Marlowe and Shakespeare relies on the complexity of the plays and characters themselves. Without Faustus dramatic and multifaceted last speech or Prosperos troublesome self-realizations, Marlowe and Shakespeare would not have achieved the representation of human charactersthose who desire, contradict, realize, and feel-- without any magical powers whatsoever.

ENG.G0.47.1,"Female Bonding in the Novel ""Roxana""",English,Argumentative Essay,"The bond between Roxana and Amy is not a standard bond between two female companions. It is different from the bond that would exist between two women of equal social standing, and different even from the bond that would exist between a mistress and her maid. It is closest, in fact, to the relationship that exists between a husband and his wife, at least in the way these relationships were regarded during Roxanas time. Roxana thus lives the life of a man in two waysone, in being the sole manager of her affairs, and two, in having a kind of wife in Amy. Amy and Roxana both hold a mutual affection for each other. Amy is devoted to Roxana from the beginning of their misfortunes, I was not able to pay her the Wages that I was in Arrears to her, yet she would not leave me; nay, and as long as she had any Money&she would help me out of her own. 1 Amy stays with Roxana despite having no prospect of ever being paid for her troubles, and remains with her through every turn of her fortunes. Roxana, too, relies on and values Amy, trusts her with managing her affairs even when she is absent for months at a time: leave Amy behind&with Directions to go to London, and stay there, to receive Letters and Orders from me what to do; 2 Having thus spent nine Months in Holland&[I] arrivd safe at Harwich, where my Woman, Amy, was come. 3 Roxana looks after Amy all the time they are together, keeping her on with a salary whenever she has the means. Roxana even shows fear for Amys life during a storm at sea, while she is also in fear for her own life: I did not know whether she was dead or alive; in this Fright I went to her. 4 The bond between them must be strong, for they are together for the rest of their lives. However, no matter how highly Amy esteems Roxana, Roxana esteems Amy to a much lesser extent. For instance, when Amy vows she would die for Roxanas sake, Roxanas only reply is, Why thats an Excess of Affection, Amy, said I, I never met with before; I wish I may be ever in Condition to make you some Returns suitable. 5 Although Amy has essentially said she values Roxanas life above her own, Roxana does not respond beyond mere pleasantries. Returns suitable is a trick of speech that could mean anything, and certainly doesnt directly mean that Roxana would lay her life down for Amy. Roxana also deems it an excess of affection, which means Roxana herself doesnt consider it normal or expected that Amy should feel this way, and she would likely never feel this way herself. Roxana also maintains their status separation from each other throughout the book. Although they are often at equal physical standing with each other, as at the beginning when Roxana has no money, Amy is always under a title of lower rank than Roxana. And when Amy is dangerously close to appearing to have higher morals than Roxana is, Roxana forces the division to re-evolve by forcing Amy into bed with a man she is not wedded to: but as I thought myself a Whore, I cannot say but that it was something designd in my Thoughts, that my Maid should be a Whore too, and should not reproach me with it. 6 Amy loves Roxana enough that she stays with her even after being treated thus poorly, but Roxana doesnt esteem Amy enough to let her have a higher status than she herself does. The bond between Amy and Roxana is paralleled with the bond between a typical husband and wife during Roxanas time. One example is the general rule that when a woman gets married, all her money and estate are at her husbands disposal, do do with as he pleases: a Wife must give up all she has&and be upbraided with her very Pin-Money 7; That the very nature of the Marriage-Contract was, in short, nothing but giving up Liberty, Estate, Authority, and every-thing, to the Man. 8 This is paralleled in Amys relation to Roxana when Amy offers to support Roxana with her own money, and as long as she had any Money, when I had none, she would help me out of her own. 9 Amy forfeits her money to Roxana, albeit willingly, just as any money a wife had of her own must go to her husband when he has need of it. Another clear parallel between Amys relationship to Roxana and that of a wife to a husband lies in the description Roxana often gives of a wifethat of an upper servant: a Wife is lookd upon, as but an Upper-Servant. 10 Amy begins as a maid to Roxana, but gradually occupies the position of an upper-servant in truth, because she manages most of Roxanas household affairs. Amy also occupies, for a time, the position of a companion to Roxana, Amy, who I now dressd like a Gentlewoman, and made her my Companion. 11 Amy occupies the position of a wife because she is in Roxanas confidence, she takes care of hiring the household staff, but she relies on Roxana for a home and companionship. Amy also has free command of Roxanas coach and of some of her money, just as a typical wife would. Roxanas first husband sets the model with which Roxana judges all other marriages, and her life often reflects this model. Roxanas first husband went abroad, kept Company, hunted much, and lovd it exceedingly. 12 After her husband dies, Roxana herself goes abroad often, mingles with company of various societal standing, and it could be said she hunts men and enjoys it. Her husband didnt care for working at a trade to keep his business flourishing, and preferred simply to spend money and not have to work to get it. Similarly, Roxana decides to earn money through offering bedroom favors instead of applying herself to an actual trade. She also shuns marriage as a result of her first experience with it, it had hurried me up and down in the World&that I had an Aversion to it. 13 However, Roxana lives the life of a man much more successfully than did her first husband. She manages her money and business affairs with such alacrity that she rarely needs the relations she keeps with men for more money: having large Sums to do with, I became as expert in it, as any She-Merchant of them all. 14 She also treats Amy with more trust and respect than her own husband treated her, having sent Any before-hand, and remitted her Money to do it, she had taken me a very handsome House. 15 This seems to suggest that the proper way for men to treat their wives in order to retain a happy existence is to follow Roxanas model, because Roxana and Amy were both mutually happy while they were together and while Roxana had no husband. Amy does, however, tend to stifle Roxana with her affections. Just as such stifling often drives men away from their wives and to mistresses and whores, so might this have been one of the reasons Roxana agreed eventually to marriage. Essentially, Roxana may have gotten married to escape Amys adoration, which reached a peak of frenzy at the beginning of Roxanas second marriage. Amys relationship with Roxana was one of extreme affection, as was shown when Amy said she would die for her, and throughout the book when Amy went abroad multiple times for Roxana to manage her affairs. And just as Roxana grew sick of one of her lovers, it may be assumed it was possible for her to grow weary of Amy. Amy is the only person other than Roxana who knows all of Roxanas secrets and everything about her life. When Roxanas daughter Susan is on the verge of discovering everything too, Amy feels the need to murder her. It is not a far stretch to interpret part of her fear for Roxana as jealousy, because Amy wants to be the only one who fully knows Roxana. In fact, Amy began talking of murdering Susan even before they are sure she knows more than she should. It is just after Susan guesses Roxana might be her mother that Amy flies into a rage, and this rage is very likely tinged with jealousy of Roxana. This time, at the beginning of Roxanas second marriage, is also when Roxana begins to become estranged of Amy, and eventually when she forces Amy out of her house. In short, Roxana stops being a husband to Amy when Amys affections become stifling, and begins being a wife to her Dutch merchant (who is an exception to the rule of a husband who takes over his wifes money). Roxana lives the life of a man for much of her life, then marries and lives the life of a woman for the rest. Thus, her marriage is not a break from her beliefs, but more a fulfillment of both these ways of living. In a way, Roxana lived a more complete existence because she had the experience of living like a man does, with a kind of wife in Amy, and living as a woman does with a husband. However, it is interesting to note that Roxana was most prosperous while she remained unmarried, a hint either that a woman is more likely to life well if she lives without a husband, or that only a mans way of life can successfully retain money.

ENG.G0.49.1,The Purgatory of the Postmodern,English,Argumentative Essay,"That God does not exist, I cannot deny. That my whole being cries out for God, I cannot forget. -SARTRE It seems that man has a rather paradoxical relationship with action. Our aphorisms include, Actions speak louder than words and Ben Franklins Well done is better than well said, but also, Do as I say, not as I do. It seems that we would prefer to predicate who we are upon our actions, unless our actions would shame us (in which case words alone will suffice.) Fictional characters function much in the same way characterization often takes place by means of the action or actions an individual undertakes. But what happens to character in a vacuum? What is character without action, character separate from history and future? In Becketts Waiting for Godot and Endgame, the problem of character separate from action is scrutinized. Nothing actually transpires in either play, and in some ways, it is possible to equate Waiting for Godot with waiting for something and Endgame with waiting for nothing. In both plays, there is a plot, but no story. We are forced to consider whether Vladimir, Estragon, Hamm, and Clov are characters, and more importantly, what Beckett was attempting to say about human action through his use of the two pairs of unvarying male characters in these pieces. Though both works display static characters, Beckett treats the characters of Vladimir and Estragon in Waiting for Godot far more favorably than Hamm and Clov in Endgame, because action or the lack thereof is at the root of his characterization, even in the bleakest and most stagnant of his plays. Characters in fictional and dramatic works are often conventionalized to some extent.1 There are typically protagonists and antagonists present in dramatic works of any scope, as well as what Phillips and Huntley call driver and passenger characters drivers drive the action of the story and are often transformed during the process, and passenger characters are more static and simply ride the waves made by the driver characters.2 But just as Becketts postmodern plays violate expectations regarding length, content, form, and style, so too do they violate typical characterization. The means of typical dramatic characterization are totally absent in these plays. We arent able to learn about these men through their likes and dislikes, their relationships with others, their past, or their inner thoughts and feelings. And, most importantly for our purposes, we are unable to characterize them based on their actions because there are none. This is not to say that there is no movement whatsoever in plays in fact, stage directions comprise a large part of the text of both plays. But what is lacking here is what I will call higher, or dynamic, purposeful action. Certainly, Estragon struggles to put on his boot and Hamm demands that his stuffed dog be brought to him, but these actions do not constitute the kind of dynamic action we are looking for. There is no action leading to a climax, resolution, or character evolution. There is no action compelled forward by the characters (or vice versa) either. It seems that in both plays under consideration, both men in the pair are passengers. The question of who is the sidekick in the duos of Didi and Gogo or Hamm and Clov is impossible to answer. Vladimir, Estragon, Hamm, and Clov are neither protagonists nor antagonists. Rather, they are all halves, one part of a character that could be present in the play but is not. One man plus one man equals a little less than one man.3 Rather than one whole character, we are given two fractured characters with diametric personalities and inclinations. It is well known that Beckett was captivated by the American comedy team Laurel and Hardy. The duo complimented each other perfectly in a number of ways. One was tall and thin, the other short and stocky one was the thinker, and the other was the doer. And this dichotomy remained the same in all of the pairs misadventures. As is the case with the pairs of characters in Waiting for Godot and Endgame, its impossible to say whether Laurel or Hardy is the sidekick or passenger character because in reality, both men are the sidekick. In Becketts Books: A Cultural History, Matthew Feldman describes Becketts work as a syzygy, or an archetypal pairing of opposites symbolizing the interplay of the conscious and unconscious minds.4 We might even say that Hamm, Clov, Didi Gogo, Laurel, and Hardy are less characters than they are archetypes of certain fragments of the human mind or human sensibility. But whether their high jinks took place in the desert or a dentists office, Laurel and Hardy were always doing something. There was action to be undertaken, tasks to botch hopelessly. In the plays at hand, the duos never truly do anything, which is the crux of the problem of characterization here. Beckett was also intrigued by the character Belacqua in Dantes Divine Comedy, perhaps to the point of obsession. Walter Strauss stresses that Becketts fascination with Belacqua emphasizes the relevance of the theme of expectancy to the modern spiritual dilemma and at the same time underscores the despair of the modern sensibility in the fact of it. 5 The paradox of this situation fits both plays, as does the stasis of this likeness to the predicament of Belacqua. But we feel the despair much more acutely in Endgame than in Godot. In the latter play, the curtain falls on the two men together, an image of humanity and companionship (if not friendship), and it seems that nothing is really at stake. Michael Robinson pointed out in his From Purgatory to Inferno that Once again Belacqua provides the image, but in Beckett this stasis is unrevoked [sic]: grace remains mute, the tremor of release never occurs, and the liberating angel, like Godot, does not arrive. 6 But is seems as if nothing changes by his not coming. At the close of Endgame, we feel crushed, awed. Considering that both plays have a similar structure and style, why is this? What makes Endgame so wrenching? What makes Hamm and Clov different as characters from Vladimir and Estragon? Vladimir and Estragon do not really live they merely exist. Similarly, Hamm and Clov never actually die or finish their lives their days together merely end, as does the play. But for Didi and Gogo, Beckett seems to believe, at least there is the waiting: ESTRAGON: What do we do now? VLADIMIR: Wait for Godot. ESTRAGON: Ah! 7 And even though after a silence, this interchange is followed by Vladimir exclaiming, This is awful! his anguish is of no importance at this stage. The point is that the pair has something, anything to wait for. They have an answer to the question of what to do next. Astride of a grave and a difficult birth may describe man, but at least there is something to do between the two extremes. Endgame is a far more desperate play precisely because there is no higher action. What is most remarkable about the piece is the texts ability to scratch and claw at the soul.8 Hamm and Clovs Theres no one else and Theres nowhere else 9 as well as the individual speeches near the end of the play are only a few of the incredibly affecting moments in this play. Statements like these create a kind of unrelenting pressure that never ceases, not even when the curtain falls. Use your head, cant you, use your head, youre on Earth, theres no cure for that! Hamm says, exasperated near the plays end. The play must end because it is a play, but the misery never ends, it seems. Whereas in Godot, where there is at least the possibility, however absurd, of waiting for God, of his existence, Endgame seems to warn against putting God before anything, even the most base, carnal desires. When the idea of prayer comes up, Nagg cries out Me sugar-plum! To which Hamm replies, God first! And then, from Hamm, we are given, The bastard! He doesnt exist! 10 Becketts distinction does not necessarily connote a condemnation of stasis or a glorification of hope and action. He does not venerate the hopeful, waiting posture of the tramps in Waiting for Godot or the (ultimately meaningless) connections Nagg and Nell, Hamm and Clov, or Hamm and his dog have to each other in Endgame. It is the resignation that Beckett admires, and the resignation of his paired characters in Godot and Endgame permeates the text to the very end. The final image of Hamm carefully shrouding himself beneath a handkerchief, alone in an empty room as he utters the word remain is strangely beautiful. But perhaps it is only beautiful because we have only seen pain, loss, and disappointment until this point, and in comparison, this moment seems stunning, gorgeous. In the same way that resignation and not hope is of primary importance in Godot, the fact that the beauty of the last image in Endgame is only discernable in comparison to abject misery, stasis, and emptiness is important. Beckett has painted two bleak portraits of postmodern purgatories that, perhaps, await us all. Without action, there can be no character and thus only resignation and stasis. The last word of the play is Hamms remain, 11 which again denotes the motionlessness of these circumstances. With that, Hamm places the handkerchief once more over his face, and the play ends, though it certainly isnt finished, and it seems that for Beckett, nothing ever truly is.

ENG.G0.49.2,"The Officer, Solness, and the Dionysian Man",English,Argumentative Essay,"The Nordic figure of Loki and the Celtic figure of C�chulainn represent two mythological extremes: Loki, the trickster of Snorri Sturlusons Eddas, ostensibly embraces his ergi or feminine qualities, and uses them to his advantage. C�chulainn, on the other hand, is ultimately defeated by the feminine power of Queen Medb, who draws him out to his death. Not only is C�chulainn metaphorically killed by feminine power, he is continually stunned by women, immobilized by the sight of their breasts, and carries out their will repeatedly in the T�in B� Cuailnge. This is made more interesting by the fact that both Loki, the son of a giant, and C�chulainn, the manliest of Ulster men, possess some feminine qualities themselves. Both are said to use of magic and spells a skill traditionally associated with women. Loki is said to become pregnant at times, and C�chulainns famous warp-spasm manifests itself as an uncontrollable fit of emotion, an occurrence only seemingly acceptable in a male because it suggests itself only in the context of battles. Both Loki and C�chulainn are ultimately killed in their respective myths, but their diametric conduct is indicative of two very different approaches to the presence of women and the feminine. Loki is the trickster of Nordic mythology. His actions are always carried out for personal gain, typically at the expense of others. In and around his rampant roguery, Loki is firstly described as being feminine, and performs some extremely feminine acts as well. He is referenced as Laufeys son, which is his mothers name.1 This family name is of not because it goes against the Nordic tradition of including the fathers name with that of the son, not the mothers. Loki is also uncommonly beautiful. In the Prose Edda, he is described as being handsome and fair of face, but has an evil disposition and is very changeable of mood. 2 Having a variable temperament seems to be somewhat of a feminine trait, but the evidence of his femininity does not end here. In his various episodes of trickery, we see Loki engaging in a number of feminine activities. He transforms himself into other forms, and in at least three of these tales, he changes himself into a woman.3 He also uses a number of artifices and types of magic, acts usually assigned to women in these myths. In the poem Hyndluljoth, Loki eats the half-cooked heart of a woman, becomes pregnant, and gives birth to the monsters that plague men, three of his own ghastly children: the Mi�gard Serpent, Hel, and Fenrir the wolf. 4 In the Prose Edda, Loki is also said to have given birth to Odins horse, Sleipnir. From early on in the Eddas, Loki appears as a figure who easily and willingly transgresses gender boundaries, leading some theorists to note him as bisexual, homosexual, or queer in both senses of the word.5 Aside from the explicit woman-like actions Loki undertakes, other figures in the myths are said to have discussed Lokis ergi qualities: In the Lokasenna, for example, Odin openly accuses Loki of being unmanly. Milking the cows as a maid, / (Ay, and babes didst thou bear; / Unmanly thy soul must seem, he says.6 There is even a story in which Loki ties his genitals to the beard of a goat (as John Lidow notes, the beard being a fundamentally male attachment to what is for all intents and purposes a female animal, the goat7) essentially castrating himself, to make the giantess Skaldi laugh.8 This broad range evidence does not necessarily to Loki being a degraded outcast, a homosexual, or a transgressor of genders. Carol Clover, among others, has suggested that the Nordic model of gender operated according to a one-sex model, which is to say, that men and women were considered to be of one gender, present in varying degrees of manliness or womanliness.9 If this were true, the derogatory term ergi, from argr, a word denoting effeminacy or unmanliness, frequently used to describe Loki, does not have as much sting as it would today. Indeed, Clover has written that the frequency with which various terms denoting femaleness is invoked with reference to men compounded with the relative lack of language describing features exclusive to women suggests that what was at stake was not effeminacy. The terminology was simply a way of describing someone who falls anywhere outside of the normative sphere of gendered behavior.10 In fact, women were often valued for having what we would consider a masculine trait: pride. In the end, what seems to have been of the utmost concern in these Norse myths was not a transgressing of gender, but instead any condition of powerlessness, however it was manifested.11 It is important to note, however, that as it reads in Sturlusons Prose Edda, Lokis torturous death was not brought on by being feminine, but for being evil and treacherous. Some scholars disagree, viewing the death of Loki with a more critical eye. Stephanie von Schnurbein sees more to this death than just punishment for Lokis rampant treachery and killing of Baldr. Von Schnurbein suggests that it was in fact just this sense of Lokis unnaturalness that made him a target of the Gods. Of Loki, Von Schnurbein writes: He represents ""the effeminate"" man and, for that reason, not necessarily because of his malevolence, is subject to derision and considered evil. This is reinforced by his indeterminate class position: his is counted among the �sir, yet he is often relegated to a subservient role vis-�-vis the gods. 12 Whether Loki represents a one-sex view of gender, a gender transgressor, or simply a trickster is a distinction that can be argued in many different ways. Nevertheless, Loki, with all of his feminine qualities, seems to get the better of his blunders until the time of his death, one could argue, because he accepts his feminine side, his ergi nature and the ways in which it manifested itself and made him different. In the Celtic mythology, unlike Loki, C�chulainn is unable to embrace the feminine or control the women in his life, and instead attempts to rule over the feminine. In reality, he is ruled by women and all that is feminine, and eventually dies at the hands of a woman. In the T�in B� Cuailnge, the hero C�chulainn is described as being the manliest of men. He is uncommonly skilled in the art of battle, huge, covered in hair, and the object of desire of almost all the Ulster women.13 But even this mans man is not without certain feminine distinctions. His name, meaning The Hound of Culann, is a starting point for this discussion of his connections and troubles with women. Though dogs are typically viewed as being masculine, tough creatures, particularly guard dogs like the one C�chulainn kills, some depictions of domesticated dogs among the Celts point to a certain degree of feminine denotation. The dog is portrayed in the Gundestrup Cauldron, and is associated here with the Gaulish goddess Sirona.14 And though C�chulainn was a skilled warrior, he was trained in battle by the expert warrior Scathach, who was a woman.15 C�chulainns infamous warp-spasm, a violent warrior rage that grips him before he fights, also seems a bit suspect when viewed in the context of his encounters with the feminine. While the descriptions of his warp-spasm in the T�in call to mind the male berserkers of Nordic lore, in reality it amounts to a complete abandon of the mental faculties and total surrender to emotions. The fact that these emotions are rage and pride are secondary to the fact that at the moment of the warp-spasm C�chulainn is flooded with emotion and overtaken by his feelings, something surely not encouraged in men. Interestingly, the only way the people of Ulster could bring C�chulainn out of these spasms was through more contact with women, as we will soon discuss. But these references to C�chulainns intimate ties with women seem almost coincidental when compared to his other encounters with the opposite sex. Though he is virile and handsome, it seems that most of his dealings with women end poorly, and in the last event, fatally. Indeed, James MacKillop titles two sections of Myths and Legends of the Celts concerning C�chulainn Troubles with Women and More Troubles with Women. More than one reference is made to what some feminists have called the male gaze in the Ulster Cycle myths involving C�chulainn he is paralyzed by the sight of women. After returning from battle in the fury of his warp spasm, the women of Ulster must rush out to meet him, bearing their breasts to stun him. While he is stunned, the men of Ulster grab C�chulainn and throw him into three vats of icy water to calm him down. MacKillop writes that C�chulainn stand[s] in awe of female beauty, sometimes in fear of it. 16 The troubles do not end here. In the tenth- and eleventh- century narrative Serlige Con Culainn agus �en�t Emire, or The Sickbed of C�chulainn and the Only Jealousy of Emer, C�chulainn continues to find himself in disadvantageous situations with women throughout his illustrious life, all of which is chronicled in these myths.17 In this tale, C�chulainn leaves a game to retrieve beautiful birds for the women of Ulster. While hunting for them, he falls asleep and has a disturbing dream in which two attractive women thrash him with a horsewhip. They beat him for so long, in fact, that the life seems drained from him. 18 The women then leave without any explanation. C�chulainn is then found, tired and ill, and carried back to Emain Macha, and lies in wasting sickness for a full turning of the seasons. Literally whipped by women, C�chulainn still ends up coming back for more: One of the women who beat him in his dream meets C�chulainn and introduces herself as L� Ban. She asks him to help defeat three terrifying enemies in exchange for L�s beautiful sister, Fand. He agrees, but is still too weak to make the journey. Emer, C�chulainns wife, comes upon him and in what reads as a moment of masculine pride, scolds him harshly for being weakened by woman love. 19 To this C�chulainn, in what seems like a complete gender reversal, expresses repentance. At the end of his life, C�chulainn is brought down by a woman, or in reality, women. Not only is he hunted and eventually killed at the hands of Queen Medb, but before his final stand, a witch transforms into a crow and flies over C�chulainns head, taunting him with reports of the destruction of D�n Delgan.20 After this episode, C�chulainns consort, Niam, convinces him to leave relative safety and head to the Glen of the Deaf, a valley where the sounds of the attack cannot penetrate. But while they are there, one of Medbs followers assumes the form of Niam. This imposter, in the shape of a woman (Niam), tells C�chulainn to leave Emain Macha to save Ulster from Medbs armies. Deluded, he agrees. It is also a woman, a crone, who precipitates C�chulainns death by helping him violate his geis by eating dog meat.21 The parade of women who stun, trick, manipulate, and abuse C�chulainn is a long one, which begs the question Why C�chulainn, why have the manly hero of Ireland so utterly ruined by women? Its possible that there is nothing special about C�chulainns interactions with women: He sleeps with them, hunts birds for them, and accepts their courtesy even when it means breaching his geis, a sacred taboo. In this view, he is virile, princely, and polite. Viewed another way, he foolish, oversexed, and easily aroused a victim of the women who surround him, and a victim of his own inability to move beyond these facts. So who wins? Loki, who embraces the feminine and dies disgraced, or C�chulainn, who is unable to control the feminine, and dies a hero? However progressive the lives and roles of women and notions of femininity appear to be in Nordic and Celtic societies when compared with other Central European cultures, there remains a strong distinction between what a man should do and how he should act and how a woman should act. Both men die one a hero, one a villain. Just how much their relationships with the feminine and women had to do with their deaths remains an area of intense discussion. And although it is tempting to extrapolate these myths and figures to speak for their respective cultures, it would be unfair to generalize two mythic figures as representatives of their age. However, it seems that in both societies though they were comparatively progressive when it came to women, femininity, and female social roles the ultimate lesson is that a clear distinction must be made between the sexes, and that with very few exceptions, men must act as men and women as women in these societies. More importantly, power must be maintained no matter what sex a person was. In the end, these inabilities to deal with women or overcome the feminine led to a loss of power in the myths of Loki and C�chulainn. In these warrior societies, power was of the utmost importance, and after losing their influence, the demise of both figures was imminent. Though the ultimate distinction between the male and the female still held strong in these myths, that any fluidity of gender roles existed in these societies or their mythology is fascinating a far cry from the supposedly advanced cultures of the world as we know it today. Nevertheless, an inability to cope with corporeal women, in the case of C�chulainn, or with the manifestations of the feminine, in the case of Loki, is not favorable in either case, and certainly seems to have played a large part in the myths of both figures, as well in their respective deaths.

ENG.G0.49.3,"This Man Loved Earth, Not Heaven, Enough to Die",English,Argumentative Essay,"We are born to die. SHAKESPEARE, Romeo and Juliet Wallace Stevens The Man with the Blue Guitar has a definite progression and a depth of content that belies its slim thirty-nine pages. The volume has as its focus the imagination, reality, and largely, death, moving from espousal and denial of Stevens beliefs to affirmation and acceptance. Interestingly, when the volume is viewed as an evolution of thought, in some ways it resembles parts of the K�bler-Ross (or Five Stage) model of dealing with death: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance being present sometimes in order, and at other times, out of order.1 Granted that this model wasnt formally espoused until 1969, these stages were almost certainly universal long before they were given a name. In The Man with the Blue Guitar, Stevens writes about his vision of the end of our lives, and of his own life. Studying this volume allows one to consider how death fits into his work as a whole, straddling escapism and reality. Death can neither be escaped nor easily dealt with in reality, which makes Stevens willingness to discuss it even more interesting. Though all poets age and inevitably die, perhaps only a poet like Stevens, who started out on his poetic journey late in life, could write with such resonance and portent on the topic of death. The core of much of Stevens works, especially his later poems, resides in the liminal space between the imagined and the actual, between escapism and reality. The Man with the Blue Guitar designates death as the supreme reality, for which Stevens had a secular answer: the supreme fiction of poetry. Before delving into the volume The Man with the Blue Guitar itself, it is helpful to Consider some of Stevens other writing outside of his poetry, most of which is extremely illuminating when it comes to his vision of art, as well as his vision of death. While some have described Stevens as self-effacing2, a wealth of is available to study in conjunction with his poetical works. In The Nobel Rider and the Sound of Words, originally given as a lecture at Princeton in 1942, Stevens discusses at length, among other things, the dialectic between imagination and reality. Reality is life and life is society and the imagination and reality; that is to say, the imagination and reality are inseparable, he writes. 3 In writing these words, Stevens not only propounds his theories, but also refutes the theories of others who had written that poetry, in general, is escapist in nature. If life does indeed consist of society and the imagination and reality, then any poetry written, any work brought forth by the act of living (in other words, all poetry) is rooted in reality and necessarily not escapist at all. It is at this junction that Stevens introduces his belief that while poetry is not an explicitly social or moral tool, it is an art form that can benefit mankind. The poets function in society, in his view, is to make his imagination theirs, and to fulfill himself only as he sees his imagination become the light in the minds of others. His role in short, is to help people to live their lives. 4 This act of helping people to live their lives is abstract, and takes many forms, one of which, as we will see, is the acceptance of death as inevitability and secular worship of the world as it is. Poetry can also protect: Near the end of the piece, in a sentence that could easily have been an axiom, he writes, It is a violence from within that protects us from a violence without. 5 We will see in The Men That Are Falling as well as in A Thought Revolved that Stevens offers poetry as just this kind of interior ferocity that has the power to protect mankind from external strife. Stevens aphorisms, taken from his personal notebooks and written throughout the 1930s and 40s, are also revealing. While some certainly have a sense of humor to accompany their insight (Poetry is a pheasant, etc.) others are extraordinarily succinct and brilliant in their summation of Stevens views. After one has abandoned a belief in god, poetry is that essence which takes its place as lifes redemption, he writes in one such maxim.6 Another aphorism in the same vein reads, It is the belief and not the god that counts. 7 And as Stevens aphorisms sought to imbue belief and instruct, so too does his poetry each poem like a missal found, as he writes in the first lines of The Man with the Blue Guitar. 8 From the opening lines of The Man with the Blue Guitar, the musical quality of the poem is apparent. The piece, consisting of thirty-three sets of rhymed or unrhymed couplets, begins like a song and ends like a sermon, moving from a melodious introduction to a beautiful if austere set of beliefs. The entire poem functions on a kind of theme-variation-theme structure, which is also evident from the beginning. The man bent over his guitar, / A shearsman of sorts. The day was green. // They said, 'You have a blue guitar, / You do not play things as they are&' the piece begins, And they said to him, But play, you must, / A tune beyond us, yet ourselves, // A tune upon the blue guitar, / Of things exactly as they are.' 9 The repetition of phrases such as things as they are and the constant expectation of play, you must makes the opening of this long poem sound like a song or a lullaby for the old and weary. It is a convention of the theater that when a character is too moved to speak, he sings, and When he is too moved to sing, he dances.10 When considered in this context, it seems fitting that Stevens The Man with the Blue Guitar is rooted in a musical metaphor: By using the guitar and the song as vehicles for his views on the imagination, reality, and even death, Stevens lends a further dimension to the piece, couching his beliefs in the form of a guitarist, or guitarist-poets, song. The speaker in this poem admits that he cannot bring the world quite round / Although I patch it as I can, setting up the rest of the piece as an attempt to bring the world and indeed the reader around to his view of things as they are. 12 In the fourth section of the poem, the guitarist-poet already begins to address the grip of denial, in the line So thats life, then: things as they are? He chafes at the thought of A million people on one string? / And all their manner in the thing& 12 He seems to wonder, can this really be it? Are we all, then, consigned to the same fate? Are we all in this together? In the fifth set of couplets, Stevens attempts to apply a salve to the wound he has rent in human consciousness by declaring that there is no God. He writes Poetry // Exceeding music must take the place / Of empty heaven and its hymns. 13 In place of religion, there is poetry, which while it does not offer everlasting life, does offer, in some ways, provisional life: an appreciation of things as they are, of the secular world and its absurdities as well as its glories. For those skeptical of this displacement of God, in the sixth set of couplets, Stevens writes that if the worship of poetry seems strange and mercurial, it should be compared with the alternative, for The thinking of god is smoky dew. 14 The poem slowly moves closer and closer to the figure of death itself after this point. Along the way, in section eleven, Stevens notes that Slowly the ivy on the stones / Becomes the stones. Women become // The cities, children become the fields / And men in waves become the sea. 15 The world of men, who created God, is crumbling in the face of immutable nature, the earth being the only worthy object of worship in this godless view. Then, in section twenty-three, Stevens unleashes half a dozen haunting, beautiful lines about the actual act of dying. The grunted breath serene and final / The imagined and the real, thought // And the truth, Dichtung und Warheit, all / Confusion solved, as in a refrain // One keeps on playing year by year, / Concerning the nature of things as they are. We are assured here, again, that the dying breath is a final one, that nothing exists beyond death, and that man has no choice but to keep playing year by year, pretending that death will not come, though he knows that it will. But more importantly, in the actual moment of death, the imagined and the real, Dichtung and Wahrheit (Poetry and Truth), are finally reconciled. It seems, for Stevens, then, that life occurs entirely in the widening and narrowing gap between the real and the imagined, and that death is the full closing of the space between them. The tone of these lines, though they discuss death, is neither fearful nor brave. It is instead final and bare. The impersonal voice advances Stevens desire to speak universally, but it also shields him from disturbing self-exposure.16 In Owls Clover, the next piece in the volume, we see more examples of nonbelievers of Stevens system. In the second part of the poem, the sculptor of the horses sees more than his muddy hands in their manes, and more than his mind in the wings, but is left with just that: his hands and his mind.17 He reaches for sublimity, for a divinity that simply is not there. The last sentence, broken over two lines, The rotten leaves / Swirled round them in immense autumnal sounds, paints a desperate picture of the sculpture, dreaming of the heavens and yet surrounded only by the material, the rotten leaves of death. The woman who then enters the poem is equally lost, and is alternately described as unmoved, tortured, and destitute. Stevens writes that Wings / And light lay deeper for her than sight, 18 wings and light being heavenly, angelic images that the woman clings to despite her sight, what the world has to offer, the way things are. The poem also culls from the everyday and harvests its imagery to create something elegiac in nature. What I tried to do in OWLS CLOVER, Stevens wrote in a letter to Ben Belitt, was to dip aspects of the contemporaneous in the poetic. 19 We see, as Joseph Riddel writes in The Clairvoyant Eye, that Owls Clover is concerned, at its root, with the opposition that Stevens would later explore further in The Man with the Blue Guitar: the opposition between things as they are and things as they are imagined.20 In a way, this dichotomy is tantamount to the opposition between reality and death and imagination and heaven. This emphasis of things as they are and the one true reality of earth does not automatically spell despair and doom for Stevens there is still beauty here on earth, for the short time we are here. It is true that the world moves from waste / To waste, out of the hopeless waste of the past / Into a hopeful waste to come, yet even where this wreckage lies, some portentous lustres, shades and shapes / Of rose exist, color being a favorite method of Stevens for expressing the good, the joyful, and the living. Though death is final, Stevens does not seem unhappy at the prospect of a secular existence. Certainly, in Imagination as Value, Stevens expressed his desire to see the earth exalted in poetry, as heaven and hell are, when he commented that the great poem of the earth remains to be written. 21 This kind of joy in the secular, possible only once an understanding of the finality and reality of death has been achieved, is discussed in A Thought Revolved. True, the poet is Happy rather than holy, but he is nevertheless happy-high, singing not hymns praising God but instead hymns of the struggle of the idea of god, not spiritual hymns but hymns of The middling beast, the garden of paradise / And he that created the garden and peopled it, which is to say, man. Repeatedly in this poem, Stevens writes of an earthly leader and the fact that there is no god but man / Of men whose heaven is in themselves. It is clear from this piece, that what is to be feared is not death, but a death before [men] die, a race that sings and weeps and knows not why. 22 Unlike the woman who appears before the sculptor in Owls Clover, we find in A Thought Revolved a woman who is not blind to the reality and finality of death, who bows before the enormity and importance of the imagination. The opening image of A Thought Revolved is an old woman dying of diabetes whose useless bracelets fondly fluttered. We are told that The idea of god no longer sputtered / At the roots of her indifferent curls. 23 Stevens chooses his words carefully here: The ladys bracelets are useless, her curls indifferent, indicating that while she is not afraid of death, as we will see, she understands the duality of the fact that she must cling to the secular, though the secular is essentially, finally, as meaningless as life is. We also learn that to this lady, It seemed serener just to die& // Accompanied by the exegesis / Of familiar things in a cheerful voice. 24 As the poem travels from despair to joy, Stevens moves from the negative images of diabetes, lesser dithyrambs and useless bracelets to images of the floweriest barge, a cheerful voice, and the night before Christmas and all the carols. This first section ends with the lines, Dying lady, rejoice, rejoice! This line would seem too glib or too silly had it not been preceded the first two poems in the volume, which outline Stevens as a champion of the secular, a poet less afraid of death than of a life whose pleasures remain unacknowledged. If men are not to fear death, then what are they to fear? To this also Stevens seems to have an answer in the form of the final poem in the volume, The Men That Are Falling. The poem is intimately linked to Owls Clover in its discussion of the fate of the poet in times of danger.25 The Men That Are Falling is a penetrating reflection on war. In a letter to Bernard Heringman, Stevens wrote that he did have the Spanish Republicans in mind when I wrote The Men that are Falling. 26 The cruelty of man toward his fellow man, perhaps, is to be feared and avoided in deaths stead. Those who set their store by God and all angels are possibly to be evaded as well. The subject of the poem is a man alone in a room at night, unable to sleep, plagued by visions of The head of one of the men that are falling, placed / Upon [his] pillow to repose and speak. 27 But we are made aware that the man whose head lies on the pillow is not to be pitied, for he loved earth, not heaven, enough to die. The terror of the real, here, is catastrophic and frightening, but not to be shied away from.28 This last poem in the volume The Man with the Blue Guitar ends with the phrase lifes voluble utterance, a secular, humanistic image. There is no need to reiterate what has already been said throughout the volume instead Stevens ends his majestic series with a strong image that speaks for the entire work. His diction is precise, for he does not write merely of lifes utterance or of lifes reticent utterance. His view of life is positive, and lifes utterances are voluble, garrulous and bountiful. Life has much to say, it seems, and also, much to give and teach us. Perhaps David Perkins illustrates the issue best when he writes referencing Stevens mountainous coiffures of Bath from the poem Le Monocle de Mon Oncle that Perhaps [for Stevens] religion is a hairdo. It was a myth that humanized the facts of mans situation and fate. The facts never changed essentially, he proposes, but the myth did and must. 29 If Stevens believed that poetry could help people live their lives, then the looming specter of death was the ultimate challenge to a society (and indeed a poet) that did not or could not believe in God, particularly in turbulent times. He was the mythmaker, the creator of something that man could conceivably believe in when faced with death, or even, with life. Though Stevens surely did not seem trouble himself (at least from what we can observe) over whether or not his message was accepted and understood, reading some passages of his poetry feels strangely like intercepting an augury from beyond the grave. Perhaps it is Stevens maintenance of an impersonal tone even during the most personal of confessions, or perhaps it is the finality of his words, so many of which read like his aphorisms, but whatever the cause, the last two lines of section thirty-one in The Man with the Blue Guitar, It must be this rhapsody or none, / The rhapsody of things as they are seem so portentous that they might have been a fitting ending to The Man with the Blue Guitar, or to the volume as a whole. Stevens maintains that the poet-guitarists song, his rhapsody, is the absolute truth, and that this truth must be accepted or none may be accepted. In other words, this is the truth, as he sees it. While he may not have subscribed to religious dogma, this was his secular version of dogma, his credo that places death at the intersection of reality and imagination.30 For Stevens, imagination and reality are a set, a pair of ideas or instances that are impossible to separate: He wrote in a letter to Hi Simons in August of 1940 that reality = the imagination, and the imagination = reality. 31 These two spheres feed off one another, exist primarily in relation to one another. In the case of death, the supreme endpoint of reality, the only tonic is what Stevens referred to as the supreme fiction, 32 that is, poetry, which, like God, has the ability to bring hope and comfort to man though he may be aware that both are born of the imagination. As Stevens writes in Adagia, The final belief is to believe in a fiction, which you know to be a fiction, there being nothing else. The exquisite truth is to know that it is a fiction and that you believe in it willingly. 33 No one knows exactly what man experiences at the moment of his own demise perhaps Wallace Stevens himself experienced the transcendent moment of unity between imagination and reality when he passed away in 1955. Whatever the case, the meditative, intellectual poetry that he left behind espouses a way of thinking that accomplishes the goal he spoke of so frequently, of to help people to live their lives. When faced with the emptiness of the heavens, Stevens poetry did not crumble under its own pointlessness instead, it turned to champion the earth, the secular, and all that is mankind in its fleeting moment of consciousness.

ENG.G0.51.1,Rejecting Colonial Memory,English,Argumentative Essay,"It is clear that a collective historical memory, which in this case refers to more of an accepted global or national notion of what happened in the past, is an integral part of society's notion of its place in time. Yet it is not valid to take this historical memory as the only existent form of history. Writers across the world strive to uncover and in some cases retain the history that, as Walter Benjamin might say, present rulers step over (Illuminations, 256). It may remain in the memory of the few, but still seem absent from the collective historical memory. Authors can choose different media to shed more light on lost aspects of the past that have been forgotten or removed. In the specific category, although it may be a problematic one, of post-colonial fiction impressive attempts to indicate lost histories can be found. This attempts maybe in relation to a specific history that the author may be trying to revive or in other cases, the author may simply try to bring to light the fact that histories may be lost in general. Two authors that bring these ideas out through their allusions, symbols and description are Derek Walcott and Michael Ondaatje. In their works, specifically Omeros and The English Patient, contain well constructed points that can be interpreted to shed some light on the loss or at least the obstruction of historical memory. In another vain, it could be argued that these authors are trying to recreate a memory that they think has been lost. Both works use allusions, characters, and specific examples to highlight the way in which colonialism has stepped over the collective memory or history of those they colonize. In Ondaatjes The English Patient, the character Kip creates an interesting subject to discuss the attempt to include the memories and histories of colonized places. One of the interesting ways in which this happens is through the transformation of Kips name. Although this happens later in the book through a flashback, it brings out a curious way of thinking about the relationship between the colony and the colonizer. First, it must be noted that the temporal setting of the book is important. During the time of World War II, India was still a colony of the British Empire. This point must be made, because some may argue that Ondaatje does not have any particular reason for the situation of Kip, and is merely reflecting the time in which the book is placed. But it must be made clear that this is almost undoubtedly not the case. As a writer who is a part of the colonial experience, one cannot take his writing just as a piece of historical fiction. The devolution of Kips name from Kirpal Singh shows brings light to one way in which the colonizer slowly covers up a colonies collective memory. The first notion of this is that as soon and the flashback of Kips time in England begins, he is no longer referred to as Kip, but as Kirpal Singh (Ondaatje 181). This is significant, because before this point, there was only one mention of Kips full name, and it was only in passing. It is almost as if the author is using the name to mark the transformation of the man. The flashback begins with the use of Kirpal Singh, and it seems that instantly the author is discussing a different person. Kirpal Singh stood where the horses saddle would have lain across its back (181). Also, in first parts of the flashback, there are references to Kip by his last name. Ondaatje makes the point that this is not the Kip that the reader has gotten to know previously in the book. It is then made fully clear at the end of the flash back when, Kip hears Miss Mordens voice. There is a change in Kip throughout his time in England. In the same passing tone that his full name was brought up at the beginning of the book, Kips name is lost. The voice of his skeptical brother is all but forgotten in favor of Lord Suffolk, who has befriended Kip. By transforming a name, Ondaatje shows how colonial powers can facilitate the loss of a collective memory, and slowly start to replace it with their own notion of collective memory. Losing the last name is especially important. In many ways, the loss of the last name shows a loss not only of his family, but in a more far reaching way, his Sikh culture. Although the author is using a personal memory situation, using a loss of culture in the example points clearly to a collective loss of memory. At this point in the book, the realization of loss is not as clear, but Ondaatje plants the seed of what would later be a full realization of the way the colony has lost some of its collective memory. Towards the end of The English Patient Kips tenuous relationship with his colonizer is exposed for what it is, and Ondaatje uses historical events to make trigger his indictment on colonial powers. As Kip hears of the atomic bomb blasts on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, all the experiences of British imposed memory and learning seem to be of no consequence, and the memory of his native history is restored. Anger boils to the surface of the usually collected Kip and Ondaatje brings to light the conflict between the memory of the colonized and the colonizer. When Kip begins to comprehend the new events, he immediately confronts the English Patient: I grew up with traditions from my country, but later, more often, from your country (Ondaatje 283). The author could not be more obvious in bringing to light how Kip's own memory has been sacrificed for that of the power of the British Empire. He uses the colonial era to describe issues that are now relevant in the post-colonial era. Kip goes further talking about how there was an element of fear behind the way in which the Indian man was changed in some way to accept the British version of memory. Memory is not always just history, but the memory of customs, the memory of a way of life. Further making this point, Kip says, Indian soldiers wasted their lives as heroes so they could be pukkah (Ondaatje 283). Pukkah here is to mean something along the lines of authentic. The point made is that Indians gave up their lives, their potential to contribute to their Indian collective memory, because they had been indoctrinated into thinking that the British historical cause was the more important. An extra point to be made from this passage is the use of a Hindi word. It is interesting that Ondaatje uses a non-English word without feeling the need to define it anyway. Could this word be seen as an attempt to show that the use of a colonial tongue is just as valid as English? Assuming that a very small portion of the books audience speaks Hindi, it could be argues that the author is bring attention to the fact that he no longer thinks that colonial languages should be relegated to the memory and should be revived again in modern writing. Taken together, Kip's conflicting relationship with the country that colonized his India shows how Britain has in many ways, through the colonial experience, suppressed the collective memory of India. Derek Walcott is another author that uses fiction to discuss the notions of the loss of collective memory. Most intriguing is one way in which Walcott chooses to highlight this, taking the project one step further and try reviving a sense of collective memory of former colonies. The tool used is myth, using a tool that extends the memory of a civilization long after it has passed to create recall a memory that was lost prematurely. Omeros plays on the myths of Homer, which have lasted thousands of years, and places them in the colonial St. Lucia. In doing so, Walcott creates a way to work inside the frame of thinking that colonial rule has created but still recall the unique memory that each colony has lost. It is critical that authors try to work within the system, because a majority of these writers are products of this colonizer-colonized system. The characters of Major Plunkett and Maud in Omeros, almost play a role like that of Friday in Robinson Crusoe. A parallel can be drawn between the two. Friday is an image of what the majority of the colonial power structure felt of those people they colonized and controlled. On the reverse of this, in Omeros, Plunkett is an image of what the colonial people think of colonial power. One purpose of including these characters is what can be considered an attempt to revive a lost memory, is to include why the memory was stepped over. Walcott understand that the colonial experience has become apart of that collective memory and must also be included in addition to the revival of the old. The best way to assert ideas is to insure that the opposition, in this case, the colonizing power, is aware of the points that are being raised. Walcott creates parallels with Greek myth that draw importance to the common memory of the colonized fisher folk. One such example is when the narrator asks, when would I not hear the Trojan War in two fishermen cursing in Ma Kilman's shop? (Walcott 270) Creating a dialog between lasting memories of myth and lost memory helps revive it. The work is filled with such examples, but this is what makes the work so effective. The close intermingling of the average colonial life with the epic stories with which many readers will be familiar makes the forgotten memory as if it had never been lost. This allusion is another tool that Walcott uses in the revival of the importance to the St. Lucia collective memory. Authors such as Walcott seem to consider myth as a way in which memory stays alive. Linking a lost collective memory to it gives it new light in a unique form that is memorable. Recalling a collective memory that has not been allowed to flourish is a difficult task. Fiction provides a medium that can at once draw attention to the lost historical memory and in some ways, revive it. Walcott and Ondaatje have found ways to incorporate the revival of memory stepped over by colonial powers. It is important to also remember that these authors come out of a combination colonial and post-colonial era, which brings out some specific characteristics in their writing. First, they have a greater understanding of how to meld two different types of traditions and further, they understand as well not to throw one out in favor of the other. Each colony/colonizer pair are apart of the collective memory of the other, and the acceptance of this fact is a key to the revival of the colony's faded memory. Second, it has given them a variety of issues specific to their homeland in which to emphasize in the voice of a person educated at the 'colonial center'. Of course they discuss multiple issues in their novels, but there is something to say about multiple authors from somewhat similar experiences address a common issue. Those readers who find truth in what they learn must understand that they also have an opportunity to reclaim an identity, a memory and a history that might have been lost or partially glazed over in the past by the colonial experience. Kip found the realization that he no longer had to strive to be pukkah, and in some ways embraced himself and the memory of his people again.

ENG.G0.52.1,Deborah and the Degradation of Israel,English,Argumentative Essay,"Throughout the Book of Judges, women play a significant role in showing the degradation of morality in Israel. When men do not come forward to stop those harming Israel, a certain woman kills the devious Abimelech with a stone, Jael defeats Canannite military leader Sisera with a tent peg, and Deborah the prophetess effectively succeeds in bringing Israel to war against the Canaanites. The text contrasts strong, obedient women with men who the authors represent as reluctant and less courageous in following the moral path to help the Israelites  qualities that are parallel to the deterioration of Israel as the Book develops. An analysis of Deborahs time as a judge offers insight into the complex representation of women in Judges. The narrator depicts Deborah as strong, wise and obedient. The texts presentation of Deborah juxtaposed with that of Barak emphasizes the lack of confidence and courage in the male leaders actions. It is Deborah who requests that Barak meet Jabins army, an act that shows her desire for freedom for the Israelites. In Judges 4:8, Barak requests Deborahs company and assistance: If you will go with me, I will go. Deborahs offering to go with him shows selflessness along with an unlikely boldness for her gender and time. At the time of battle, her commands to Barak further the unexpected behavior of a woman  instead of the typical, passive behavior, Deborahs character takes control and Barak merely follows her instruction. Barak as the male figure, on the other hand, seems reluctant and uneasy about the battle. With the womans support, Barak achieves in destroying the army of Sisera. It is evident that without Deborah going up with him  however this could be interpreted  Barak may not have been so successful. It is interesting that Deborah comforts Barak by saying, The LORD is indeed going out before you. It suggests a comparison of the comfort the two figures provide. Deborahs prophetess allows her the ability to foresee events that other judges could not. In her assurance of Barak, she warns him that he will not gain the glory from defeating the Canaanites: &nevertheless, the road on which you are going will not lead to your glory, for the LORD will sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. (Jud. 4:9) In the passage, the text depicts Deborahs words as reassuring verses threatening. The authors make Deborah appear as admirable in her ability ot persuade Barak to act. It is interesting that Deborah is defined as being the wife of her husband rather than her origins, her place of residency, or who she descends from: At that time Deborah, a prophetess, wife of Lappidoth, was judging Israel(Jud. 4:4). The text does not present Deborah as the daughter of anyone; the reader does not know what her roots are and cannot follow the layers of her decent  here, Deborah is only defined as a wife. While the song later refers to her as a mother, it is interesting that this strong leader is not more clearly associated with an Israelite past. It is one detail that sets Deborah apart from the other judges, and again emphasizes her courage in a powerful role. From the first passage of her introduction, the setting of Deborahs judgment also sets her apart from the other judges: She used to sit under the palm of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim; and the Israelites came up to her for judgment (Jud. 4:5). Deborah sits in a protective setting, under the shade of a palm, which could either be interpreted as her need for protection as a female or the approachability a counselor with this casual office versus one set in Jerusalem  might suggest. Deborah makes herself public, accessible. Another significant detail is that the palm sits between the Ramah and Bethel in the hills of Ephraim. Israelites travel from both areas to receive her guidance. Ephraim as a geographical point between the two cities could imply Deborahs unifying of the Israelite people in the text. Another explanation for Deborahs setting could be that her prophetess makes her different from the other judges who physically go out to reach their people, making her advice more valuable. Along with other disparities between Deborah and the male judges, Deborahs femininity could also contribute to her effective leadership. In Judges 5,Deborah and Barak sing, The peasantry prospered in Israel, they grew fat on plunder, because you arose, Deborah, arose as a mother in Israel(Jud. 5:7). The texts referral to Deborah as a mother highlights her femininity and the authors positive portrayal of the use of the feminine power. According to the text and outcome of the war, the Israelites were able to prosper and rejoice. The song recalls poetry and the expressive, typically joyous songs of the text, exemplifying the success during Deborahs time as a judge. The language of Baraks timid quote referenced earlier is distinctive amidst the surrounding prose. If you will go with me, I will go; but if you will not go with me, I will not go. The parallel, poetic verse expresses Baraks insecurity. The reason Deborah, as a female, is a judge is not explained in the text. Other stories in the Book of Judges, however, can help analyze the situation to generate possible reasons for her position. Jael, for instance, is an unlikely hero, especially relative to Deborah. Prior to murdering Sisera, Jael plays an insignificant role in society  she is a wife, and not much else; she is not even an Israelite. Jael uses her femininity and hospitality, however  the two traits she is likely accustomed to as Hebers wife  to lure Sisera into her home to kill him. Instead of directly confronting him in a way she would most likely fail, Jael waits until he is resting, tired, vulnerable. She goes softly to Sisera, an adjective that hints to Jaels femininity and an aspect of Jael that possibly makes the defeat of Sisera successful. Before, no man in Baraks army succeeds in defeating Sisera. From Jaels story, the text could imply that Deborah rose to judgment when no man was willing. Another certain womans actions mimic those of Jaels. In Judges 9:53, a certain woman threw an upper millstone on Abimelechs head, and crushed his skull. In this, the text further shows the decline of male leadership, or leadership in general, in Israel. The text deems it appropriate that a woman and a stone stopped Abimelech, the man who killed all of his brothers to gain power. The text does not provide much information about this woman, but the two stories of a female striking a male in the head with a similarly unconventional object are undeniably similar. It also stresses the independence of Jael and the certain woman in both actions  the text describes no cohorts in either scene. After no men have taken the chance to kill either Sisera or Abimelech  none of the men in the war with neither Siseras army nor any of the men at the tower in Thebez. It was the woman in both situations that stepped forward to act in what the text says is Adoshems punishment for the crimes Sisera and Abimelech committed, making these instances analogous to Deborahs situation. The men remain in the background, passively following commands of those they fear. The text also uses women to further show the immorality of Israel. While Jael killed an enemy, the certain woman rid Israelites of one of their own. Abimelech was, whether appropriately or not, a leader. After killing all but one of his seventy half brothers, Abimelech gains his leadership. It is the unknown, certain woman who the text presents as courageous enough to murder him. Again, although the authors do not write it directly, the passage about this woman could suggest one reason that Deborah is a judge. The role of women in the Book of Judges is crucial to its representation of the downward moral and religious state. A thorough look at the relationship between Deborah and Barak offers a potential understanding of the texts portrayal of other women throughout the book. Female roles emphasize inadequate representations of male characters. Deborah was judge at the Canaanites, for example, but it cannot be certain why she was a judge. Passages in Judges, such as the housewife Jael killing Sisera rather than a male or the certain woman killing Abimelech before another man, suggest that Deborah rose judge Israel when no male was willing.

ENG.G0.53.1,Carwin and the Imp of the Perverse,English,Argumentative Essay,"In one of his famous short stories, Edgar Allen Poe defined perverseness as the completion of an action for the reason that it should not be done.1 The spirit that motivates this type of action is therefore known as the imp of the perverse, and its presence can be found in the works of other authors as well. One predecessor of Poes who made use of the idea of the imp of the perverse was Charles Brockden Brown in his novel Wieland. A person motivated by the imp of the perverse is inherently asocial and amoral, and Browns character of Carwin the biloquist is certainly both. His irresponsible choices and decision to continue using his biloquism lead to the creation of an irrational, anarchic atmosphere which both influences Wielands violence and has a lasting, powerful effect on the reader. By the time he enters the story, Carwin is already well versed and in control of his gift. Early in life, he made this powerful engine subservient to the supply of my wants, and the gratification of my vanity and exercised it with more or less success (Brown, 227). Force of habit and temptation encourage Carwin to use his ventriloquism the first two times that the Wieland family thinks they are hearing mysterious voices (Brown, 228-9). The language he uses when telling Clara his story proves that Carwin knew his actions were wrong but also that he does not want to take the blame for what he did. His path seemed irrevocable, his actions mechanical, and the impulse that led him on infatuation (239-40). These attempts at shaking off guilt fall especially flat near the end of the story, when Carwin seeks some retreat in the wilderness and then escapes to his brothers farm in the bosom of a fertile desert, near the sources of the Leheigh (242-4). Had Carwin bothered to do this earlier rather than giving in to the temptation to stay, the story may have ended quite differently. His attempt to shift blame to outside forces prove that Carwin knew his actions were wrong. This knowledge, coupled with the fact that Carwin continued to use his gift and interfere with the family as the story, proves that he was indeed motivated by Poes imp of the perverse: he knows what he should do and does exactly the opposite, simply because he can. Carwins relationship with Poes imp of the perverse is also reflected in his behavior to the Wieland family. By the time he enters their social circle, he has intimate knowledge of all of them because of his affair with Judith. He knows the small size of their family circle, the mysterious death of the elder Wieland, as well as the strange incidents which had just taken place. Rather than leave the family alone after using his gift the first two times, he enters their company and proceeds to offer opinions on the recent incidents. This decision to contribute to the family discussion about the mysterious voices is extremely perverse, as is the fact that he basically explains to the family how he tricked them with ventriloquism by professing a belief in a human agent attached to the voices (85). By aligning himself with Pleyel, he knows that he is encouraging Wieland to hold even more firmly to his belief in celestial interference, as that is how the family discussions always seem to work out, as Judith would have undoubtedly explained (85). Instead of legitimizing and perhaps helping to moderate Wielands belief in God, Carwin uses his knowledge of family dynamics and puts Wieland in the minority among the group and pushing him towards religious extremism. Besides affecting Wieland, Carwin creates an atmosphere that negatively influences the relationship between Pleyel and Clara. His interference in this quarter seems especially motivated by the imp of the perverse, for he correctly guesses at their affection for one another and then takes steps to separate them. Carwins overall interest in Clara appears perverse: he knows that she has feelings for another man and yet continues in a kind of intellectual pursuit. His fascination with Clara begins with Judiths testimony of her perfections and his meeting with Pleyel is staged to allow direct intercourse with Clara (230-4). His infiltration of the house then allows him to find and read Claras private diary, a violation of her personal privacy and of all social codes. It is in his deception of Pleyel, however, that Carwin is at his most amoral. Though Carwin could tell that Pleyel was a devoted lover, his vanity is tempted at the chance to convince Pleyel of Claras infidelity (239). By convincing the logical Pleyel that Clara is having an affair with him, Carwin experiences the sweetest triumph he had ever enjoyed (239). While Carwin attempts to justify this victory as momentary, the very fact that he was tempted to deceive Pleyel and tear the potential couple apart was a blow at their happiness and social mores (239). Carwins guilt after this incident and his long night of conflicting fears and tumultuous regrets prove that he knew what he was doing was wrong the whole time but had chosen to act anyway, defining his interference as perverse. The role that Carwin plays in the murders is questionable, but his real evil in the story is the creation of a certain mood which encourages Wieland to violence. Rather than the rational debate and discourse which rule the family before Carwins illicit arrival, the atmosphere after the voices occur is unstable and irrational. The religious mania which occupied the elder Wieland begins to take hold in his son, most likely because of the unexplainable voice actually cased by Carwin. Religion is Wielands way of dealing with the mysterious voice, and his assumption that God is speaking to him when it is actually Carwin leads Wieland down a dangerous path. The voice (Carwin) builds validity, first speaking a warning about the temple and later telling the family that Clara is unconscious outside of their door. When the voice warns Pleyel that his fianc� is dead in Europe well before he receives official news of it, it seems that it must be God speaking when it was just Carwin making a lucky guess. His interference in this conversation is especially amoral: he is well hidden in the temple and speaks out in a very private conversation simply because he can and because he knows he should not. The association of the voice with God proves deadly to Wielands family, and Carwins failure to step forward and acknowledge his antisocial behavior makes him culpable for aiding Wielands mania. Browns portrayal of Carwin as fitting Poes later definition of perverse makes Wieland a more powerful novel and helps it to have a much greater effect on the reader. By the time Carwins confession comes near the end of the story, any reader familiar with Gothic tradition expects some account of a wrong done by an ancestral Wieland to Carwins family. Gothic novels tend to relate stories of a fathers or grandfathers sins being passed down to a current generation, who must pay for past mistakes. Brown does not take this path and this departure from convention helps make Wieland so memorable. In the end, Carwin has no real motive at all: he sees that he can have power over the family by the use of biloquism and proceeds to effectively ruin their lives by creating an irrational and unexplainable atmosphere that negatively influences Wieland. Carwins education, which is evident to Clara and the rest of the family when they meet him, means that he was probably somewhat aware of social norms, but chose willfully not to follow them. This lack of motive haunts the reader, for though Clara blames herself at the end of the story for not being gifted with ordinary equanimity or foresight, if Carwin had no motive then there was no effective way that he could have been stopped. The pointlessness of Carwins actions and the subsequent death of Wielands wife and children are harder for the reader to deal with than a simple motive, making Wieland even more powerful. Wieland was written in a different age and by a far different author than The Imp of the Perverse, yet Poes definition holds true for Browns creation. The idea that a person would do something simply because they know they should not do it can seem petty when practiced on a small scale, but when practiced as a type of lifestyle it can drastically affect the lives of those around the perverse person. Carwin is an essentially amoral, antisocial character who recognizes the rules of society and knows what should be done, as evidenced by his attempt to shift all blame from himself, but refuses to do it. His interference in the lives of the Wieland family leads to the creation of an illogical, disordered atmosphere which leads Wieland to turn to the religious mania of his father in an attempt to explain the universe and which almost breaks apart the relationship between Clara and Pleyel. The fact that Carwin does these things simply because he can and because he is not supposed to added to his lack of any traditional motive makes the story more memorable and powerful for the reader.

ENG.G0.55.1,Self Destruction in Kindred,English,Argumentative Essay,"Self mutilation and self destruction serve many roles in Octavia Butlers Kindred. They show the ties that Rufus, Dana, and Alice all have to one another. Although Butler uses three different characters who experience self destruction and mutilation in different ways with a different meaning for each character, this theme of destruction contains an overarching message for the audience and society as a whole. As a human species, we are all related, with an average 0.03% difference in genetic makeup between the most seemingly different individuals (Kottak 1997). Thus, when human beings hurt each other, they are hurting themselves much like Dana is physically and emotionally hurt when she hurts her ancestor, Rufus. Butler uses physical destruction to represent the physical and emotional destruction of racism on society as a whole, not just the minority victims. The theme of loss is introduced when the novel begins with Dana losing her arm. By killing Rufus, her ancestor, Dana has lost him as well as her connection to him. By losing her connection to her ancestor, she is also losing her control over history. She cannot return to the past anymore because Rufus is not there to call her. Therefore, she loses the ability exert her modern influence on the past. She is given this control by Rufus whenever he is in danger- she is entrusted with the responsibility to save his life whenever he is in trouble. The destruction of this tie to her relative as well as control over her past takes a physical manifestation in the loss of her arm. When she loses him, she also loses a part of herself. I moved my head, tried to look at the empty place& the stump (Butler 10). Here Dana describes her loss as an empty place, something physically missing from her. When she struggles to free her arm from the wall, it reminisces how she struggled to free herself from Rufus- his control over her while she was in the past as well as her obligation to keep returning to the past to help him. Her arm was stuck into the wall, much the same way she was stuck with trying to help Rufus. The theme of loss plays an important role in the novel. When Dana kills Rufus, this represents the ultimate loss of control. She cannot control him physically, and has lost the ability to reason with him and persuade him to do what is right. She also cannot control herself, unable to stop herself from killing her ancestor. In addition to a physical self-destruction, Dana emotionally self-destructs when she is in the past. She in a sense becomes a victim of the times, letting the racist attitudes of the past affect her. What had I done wrong? Why was I still slave to a man who had repaid me for saving his life by nearly killing me. Why had I taken yet another beating (Butler 177). In this passage, Dana doesnt understand the changes on her values and motivations for decision making. Her values are from a different time, and do not coincide with the values of those in the past that she is visiting; they do not fit in there because they are molded by the society she came from. Likewise, the Weylins values are molded by the society they came from. As a result of her spending so much time in the past, and trying to behave in a socially accepted manner to avoid beatings, she accepts things that she would not have accepted while she was back at home, such as taking the beating in the passage described above. Once he had told Rufus in my presence, You ought to be ashamed of yourself! A nigger can read better than you! (Butler 102). She learns not to respond to derogatory remarks about her color, intelligence, or place at the plantation to save herself from beatings, as well as to maintain the confidence of the Weylins, who she needs to protect her. As Rufuss guardian, Dana is responsible for the well-being of the Weylins only son and protects from fatal harm while she is there. Even though this is true, Dana still feels poorly treated by the Weylin family. In spite of the abuse she feels like she is taking, she still has compassion for Rufus. She becomes a victim of her concern for him, and is very naive when it comes to assessing his character and predicting his actions. I would have all I could do to look after myself. But I would help him as best I could. And I would try to keep friendship with him, maybe plant a few ideas in his mind hat would help both me and the people who would be his slaves for years to come (Butler 68). Here, Dana thinks that she can change Rufus's world view to that of a modern day man. She is blinded by the fact that this man is her ancestor, when in truth he would not hesitate to hurt her as evidenced by the passage where Dana and Kevin try to leave the Weylin plantation. Youre not leaving! he shouted. He sort of crouched around the gun, clearly on the verge of firing. ""Damn you, youre not leaving me!"" He was going to shoot. I had pushed him too far. I was Alice all over again, rejecting him. Terrified in spite of myself, I dove past the mares head, not caring how I fell as long as I put something between myself and the rifle (Butler 188). Here Dana has pushed him too far. It is shown that Dana does not have as much control over Rufus as she thought she did prior to this incident. Although she was terrified that Rufus would shoot her or Kevin, she put herself in danger to exert some control over Rufus by defying what he wanted. This form of self destruction served as resistance to Rufuss control over her as well as the mindset of white superiority in 1819. Rufus own self-destructive behavior signifies his dependence on Dana. She comes to save him every time he is hurt; she represents security for him. Every time he feels insecure, he has her to call on. Despite his careless behavior, including setting his bedroom drapes on fire and falling from a tree, he can always count on Dana to save him if he is in danger. A white mans dependence on a black woman is an unusual theme to take place in 1819. The boy was literally growing up as I watched- growing up because I watched and because I helped to keep him safe. I was the worst possible guardian for him- a black to watch over him in a society that considered blacks subhuman, a woman to watch over him in a society that considered women perennial children. I would have all I could do to look after myself. But I would help him as best I could. And I would try to keep friendship with him, maybe plant a few ideas in his mind hat would help both me and the people who would be his slaves for years to come (Butler 68). Here, Butler shows the reader that although Danas travel through time helps her ancestor, it is at great risk to herself. Dana recognizes that this is because she is black, and blacks were treated as subhuman during this time. Because she is black, Rufus feels as if he should be the one helping her, not the other way around. He resents her because this difference in status is accompanied by a power differential. Dana saves Rufuss life, teaches him how to read, and serves as his protector. He takes his anger out on her when his father dies, even though he knows it was not her fault and that she tried to save him. 'Dana? What? I know you tried to help Daddy. I know. Then why did you send me to the field? Why did I have to go through all that, Rufe? He shrugged, winced, rubbed his shoulders. He still had plenty of sore muscles, apparently. I guess I just had to make somebody pay (Butler 216). However, by punishing Dana he is punishing himself as well through her. The relationship between Dana and Rufus is like a tug of war; what Rufus takes away from Dana he takes for himself. However, whenever he hurts Dana he later suffers himself when the rope is pulled the other way and Dana benefits. Rufus tries to control Dana through his punishment, which he thinks he should be able to do to a black woman in 1819, but ultimately fails. While he may gain short term victories, he loses everything in the end. This represents his loss of self-control. Since Dana is his ancestor, she is merely an extension of him. He cannot control her any more than he can control his temper, his emotions, or his tendency to get himself into much more trouble than he can handle. It is obvious that Dana cannot control Rufus as a black woman who is assumed to be his slave, but Rufus cannot have complete control over Dana either. Rufuss lack of control over Dana is subtle in the beginning of the novel, but becomes more apparent as the novel goes on. The ultimate loss of control comes when he attempts to rape Dana. He believes that he is entitled to whatever he wants, including Dana. However, Rufuss attempt at the ultimate betrayal of Danas trust shows just how much of an equal and opposite relationship the two characters have. When Rufus betrays Dana, she wins the battle for the moment by killing her ancestor. However, since they depend so much on each other for their own existence, when Dana loses Rufus, she also loses a part of herself. This takes a physical manifestation in the loss of her arm. The closeness between these two characters takes on a sexual meaning for Rufus. Although he technically owns Dana in the past, he cannot make her love him, any more than he can make Alice love him. Even though he claims to love Alice, Rufus insists on controlling every aspect of her life, and Alice resents him for this. Rufuss desperation for Alice to accept him is taken too far when he pretends to sell their children. By doing this he pushes her too far. This is similar to the incident where Rufus threatened to shoot Dana and Kevin when she tried to leave. Here Dana pushed Rufus too far, where Rufus pushes Alice too far when he convinces her that he sold their children. Here the theme of self destruction is evident. Each of these three characters represents parts of a whole- a family. By hurting one member, everyone suffers, in essence hurting oneself by hurting one part of the whole. Alices suicide plays a dual role. It represents self-destruction, as she physically destroys herself, and forces her children to grow up without a mother (although she thinks this has already happened). In addition, it serves as an extreme form of resistance to Rufuss control over her. Her death is severe punishment for Rufus, and further confirmation that he would never have Alice, much in the same way that he could not have Dana. The dynamic relationship between Dana, Rufus, and Alice represents different extensions of the same whole. They are all essential for each others survival, and show dependence on one another. When the relationship between any of the three characters is harmed, one or all of the characters are often physically hurt. This takes the form of both self mutilation and self destruction. One character can most painfully hurt the others by hurting himself/herself. This is shown by Alices suicide, as well as when Dana kills Rufus. Both of these examples also show the complete loss of self control. Each character knows that he/she will also hurt himself/herself, either physically, emotionally, or both, by hurting one of the others that they are so closely related to. The struggle for control over oneself, others, and history are prevalent themes in the novel. Butler uses destruction to represent the detrimental effects of racism, both physical and emotional, on everyone involved.

ENG.G0.55.2,Illustrations in Persepolis,English,Argumentative Essay,"When I first flipped through Marjane Satrapis Persepolis, I was very confused why it had been assigned for my Literature class. I thought students were supposed to read Literature, not looked at pictures of it. Unable to understand why this picture book was assigned for a college class rather than a third grade class, I began reading; maybe I could figure out why. After a closer reading, I saw that the book deals with the complex political and social history of Iran, and would not be fully understood or appreciated by a third grader. Satrapis personal struggle with her own identity is a significant theme as well, which many college students can relate to. I believe that Satrapi, as an artist, found a fantastic way to represent her life story with frames containing both pictures and words. This style works well for her particular story. Pictures can be used to express emotions and feelings that cannot be done by words alone. The graphics add substance to the book rather than take away from its complexity or its meaning. While some may argue that the use of graphics is a way to dumb the book down, they function as a way to communicate ideas in a different way, which in the case of Persepolis is very effective. Nima Naghibi, one critic who has examined the graphics in this novel, sees this method of writing as a means of resistance to the Iranian regime. Since she looks at the form of the text itself, Naghibi can be considered a Formalist critic. Satrapi stresses throughout the book that her family is progressive and their views westernized. Her parents participate in demonstrations against the oppressive regime; the rebel in whatever ways they can without getting arrested. Their way of dress: her fathers tie, shirt tucked in, and no beard and her mothers hair peeking through her veil are both acts of resistance (Persepolis I 75). In addition to the resistance shown within the book, the book itself in its graphic form is a sign of resistance. The graphic novel format itself is western, and would therefore be considered controversial by the regime. Many western readers still consider graphic novels the way the Greeks once saw proseas a good story, but not as Literature. Eastern readers consider this even more controversial than in the west. It was also unusual and discouraged for women to write autobiographies, as autobiographical stories have been perceived as a form of metaphorical unveiling as indecorous as physical unveiling (Naghibi 224). As a female, a child, and a person who is not a member of the government, it is politically unacceptable for Satrapi to be the one who tells Americans the story of Irans political history and present state. The form of the book itself as a graphic autobiography is a sign of rebellion. Another Formalist critic, Theresa Tensuan, like Nagini believes that the narrative persona of Satrapis Persepolis literally as well as figuratively question the social codes and communal assumptions that engender limited and limiting roles and establish specific parameters in which these roles can be enacted (Tensuan 954). Coming from a culture where one cant speak his/her views without fear of execution, it seems natural for Satrapi to draw her story. As a child she saw many of the terrible things that happened in her country, but could not openly express her feelings about what she saw in words without fear of punishment. However, she often expressed her feelings by her actions, such as participating in demonstrations and letting the front of her hair show through her veil, wearing sneakers, a jean jacket, jeans, and a Michael Jackson button from Spain (Persepolis I 133). She also continuously wore jewelry after her principal told her not to, and even hit the principal (Persepolis I 143). These actions show that the safest way to rebel was by actions, not words, although even these could get her in trouble. Unable to openly speak out, she had these visual images in her mind, unable to speak about them anyplace but her own home. This is another statement she could be making by using graphic form. As Satrapis memory of her childhood is both in mental pictures and words, the books use of a combination of the two is more accurate and true to the original source. By using a combination of narration and dialogue, she is presenting a story and leaving the value judgments to the reader. She shows you what she remembers, and then you decide what to make of her perceptions. Persepolis cues the reader to closely attend to the ways in which her perception of the work is inflicted by strategic misrepresentations, a systemic lack of information, and active acts of interpretationelements that are constantly at play when one tries to establish what bell hooks has defined as an oppositional gaze (Tensuan 956). It is obvious to the reader that these are Marjanes perceptions, because she is a child telling the story. She speaks in very concise, short sentences the way a child would. Her drawings allow the reader to go inside her mind, such as the picture of her indecision about the veil. Half of her is wearing the veil and half is not, torn between her religious and her revolutionary sides (Persepolis I 6). She presents her story through the pictures in her mind. The use of graphics allows an honesty that cannot be expressed by words alone. She is revealing her experiences to us, not just her thoughts. It would be one thing to say that the veil was oppressive. As the book was first written in French, Satrapis intended audience is a western one. The view of the veil as oppressive is a common viewpoint in western society, and is not really that startling of a point to describe. Satrapis physical depiction of the veil, however, shows this in a way that words cannot express. The fundamentalist woman shown on page 75 is completely covered by her veil, as only her face shows (Persepolis I). Everywhere that Marjane is shown wearing the veil, it is drawn very rigidly; it constricts her image, and symbolically constricts her life. It is exaggerated in size and covers most of her upper body, showing the significance of this change in her life, of being obligated to wear the veil. Her scarf is bigger and seems to be more repressive than other girls scarves (Persepolis II 127). In the class photo, the girls seem to be wearing nothing except for the veilit completely dominates the picture (Persepolis I 3). Similarly, the veil begins to dominate her life. Satrapi points out that women became more concerned with getting arrested for their appearances than asking themselves Where is my freedom of thought? Where is my freedom of speech? My life, is it livable? Whats going on in the political prisons? (Persepolis II 148). The fear of the regime not only physically suppresses them with the veil, but emotionally as well, distracting them from their thoughts of liberty and replacing these thoughts with fear for their safety and the safely of loved ones. This depiction of domination makes it more apparent when it is shown, rather than told. Tensuan looks at the way graphics add to the novels meaning in a way that words cannot. Im particularly interested in the ways in which comics help us see how particular narrative conventions and visual idioms work to enscript our critical perspectives and purviews (Tensuan 951). An example of the way in which visuals work in ways that words cannot can be found on page 150 where Satrapi uses images to represent the repressed feelings of the people behind the walls: joy, laughter, sexuality, dancing, having fun, vanity, music, etc. These ideas are too numerous to list without losing the readers attention. However, this visual image is much more aesthetically pleasing than a list of words. It truly captures the readers attention because it is beautifulthis draws the reader in and entices them to consider the richness of life behind the walls (Persepolis II 150). In addition, the group of women as shown in public in veils and long dresses is contrasted with an image of the same women in private. The difference is striking. Everyone looks the same in the first picture, but in the second different hair colors and styles are apparent, three of the girls are wearing lipstick (a sign of rebellion), low cut tops and jewelry. The east and west contrast is apparent in these photos as wellthe familiar and the unfamiliar images to the western reader. Satrapis use of images to tell her story often draws upon other common images already known by the reader. This visual connection between her images and images from the readers own social memory is more effective than trying to connect a written image to a visual one. In the opening pages of Persepolis, Satrapi draws an image of her mother demonstrating in the streets as an act of protest against the rise of the regime that took power after the deposal of the Shah. Satrapis rendition of her mother chanting and raising a fist is based on a picture captured by a German photographer and printed in newspapers across Europe; the photo becomes a point of pride for the young Marji who is constantly gauging the heroism of members of her family in relation to the exploits, sacrifices, and sufferings of her classmates kin. In casting her mother as an icon of heroic resistance, Marji could be aligned with readers of or of the who would be cued to see Taji Satrapi as an emblematic representation of individual resistance, communal movements, and democratic progress (Tensuan 957). If the reader is familiar with the particular photo Satrapi references here, the comparison is much more striking as a visual comparison than a written one, since the source is also graphic. A third critic, Gillian Whitlock, makes the Marxist argument that Satrapis choice of graphic form is to get her message out to as many different people as possible. Part of the power of comics is that this mediation occurs now across cultures in a global network of sequential art. Although there are distinctive and readily identified national and cultural traditions of comics& the vocabulary and grammar of comics are widely accessible and adaptable (Whitlock 969). The division of language, and even culture, can be overcome through drawings. Coming from a revolutionary family, Marjane wants change for her country and the way it is viewed. You are going to shut up or I am going to make you! I am Iranian and proud of it! (Persepolis II 43). The size of the text in this frame are the largest anywhere in the book, emphasizing that in this one instance her words are more important than her drawing. She wants her message to be heard so badly that she stood up to a group of kids from school when Iran was the epitome of evil and being Iranian was a heavy burden to bear (Persepolis II 41). The drawings in the novel are a way to get this message out to more people. That a person from Iraq, Irans enemy for years, was able to see many similarities between Marjane and himself gives this form even more of a potential to impact others. It is too scary how much we have in common, Iraqis and Iranians I mean& Some of the things about the start of the Muslim revolution make me think about what is happening right now in Iraq& I had the urge to start translating it and throwing copies of it on the streets of Baghdad. Why cant we learn from other peoples mistakes? (Salam Pax qtd. in Whitlock 969). This strong reaction from a rival country made me see just how wide of an impact this book can have. Because it is easily translatable, Satrapis story and message can easily reach mass amounts of people. Part of the power of comics is that this mediation occurs now across cultures in a global network of sequential art& the vocabulary and grammar of comics are widely accessible and adaptable (Whitlock 969). This is truly a revolutionary work. The way Satrapi draws people in the book gives political comments with each image. The background is black throughout most of the novel, representing oppression of the evil Iranian regime. The people in the novel are the only source of light, which she uses to represent goodness. On p. 21, the Iranian and Iraqi leaders bodies are drawn in black, while their background is white, a reversal of her normal color scheme in the book to show how she felt about the leaders (Persepolis I). In addition, Satrapis choice to draw in comic-style fragments, rather than one picture per page, is a conscious choice that is worth examining as well. The panels of comics fracture both time and space (Whitlock 970). This allows the reader to see her world as fragmented, or incompletethere is clearly a problem in her country. According to Whitlock, dehumanizing the frame of reference that mediated representations of veiled women (974) makes the oppression seem worse than it already appears to the reader. The regime is making not only cruel, but inhumane impositions on the life of Iranian women. The way the frames work is not always apparent the first time reading the novel, but becomes apparent upon rereading. Marjanes unconventional style of communicating her story definitely forces the reader to read actively. With both words and pictures, the reader has a lot to pay attention to if he/she is to fully appreciate the book. The specific demands comics makes on the reader to produce closure  the work of observing the parts but perceiving the whole&comics require the reader to become a collaborator, engaging in an active process of working through (Whitlock 970).

ENG.G0.58.1,My Reading of Chaucer,English,Argumentative Essay,"The length and the abstractness of Chaucers Retractioncan be deceiving and misleading, it can potentially lead readers to believe that the Chaucers retraction is trivial and insignificant. The strong religious references may even deter the reader from exploring further. And because the text is disconnected and isolated from other tales and other parts of The Canterbury Tale, people can even treat it like the unfinished Cooks Tale. One of the most vital messages of The Canterbury Tales is hidden in Chaucers Retraction: Since Geoffrey Chaucer possess the awareness and honesty like the Pardoner, he has the guts to confess his sins. And his intention is not to just confess his sin or ask for his own forgiveness, but he hints that the readers should also ask for the mercy of God to forgive their sins. The identity of speaker, Chaucer, is central to the meaning of the retraction. In this passage of Chaucers Retraction, And if ther be any thyng that displea-se hem, I preye hem also that they arrette it to the defaute of myn unknnynge and nat to my wyl (1082-1083, Chaucers Retraction). Chaucer asserts that anything that offends the reader should be imputed to his lack of ability and not to his will. Here, it is the second time that Chaucer has made the similar type of claim in The Canterbury Tales. In Chaucers Tale of Sir Topas, the Host interrupts Chaucers tedious tale by saying Namoore of this, for Goddes dignittee,/ for thou makest me/So weryof thy verray lewednesse (906, Sir Thopas). Chaucer responds with Why so? Why wiltow lette me. / Moore of my tale than another man/ Syn that it is the beste tale I kan (926-928, Sir Thopas). Chaucer claims that he has told the story the best of his ability, the beste tale I kan. Ironically, no one in the history of the literature would doubt Chaucers ability to compose poetry with complex ideas. The readers are fully aware that Chaucer has the ability to tell a magnificent and profound tale. Is Chaucer lying? What is important to point out is that we must distinguish the author Chaucer and the character Chaucer in the poem. They are completely different people: the author, Geoffrey Chaucer is unquestionably one of the greatest English author and poet of all time. He is the first author to finish his masterpiece in the vernacular English language. The reason why we are still reading Chaucers text today is because the greatness and the inherited values and ideas embedded in this rich text. On the other hand, the character Chaucer in the book is a completely different character. He is a story teller, and he tells the worst tales among all pilgrims. In The Tale of Sir Topas, each stanza is intentionally filled up with clich�s and absurdities. This is a symbolic move on Geoffrey Chaucers part. The character Chaucer is a representation of writers, especially the writers who do not have the skill to compose fresh rhymes or innovative thoughts, who continue to write clich�s and conventional expressions. Those writers are precisely who Geoffrey Chaucer criticizes and makes fun of because there is no profound literal value or an attempt to solve social problems. In contrast, Geoffrey Chaucers Canterbury Tales is precisely the opposite: the tales resembles an entire society, high and low, male and female, old and young, Christian or pagan, educated or ignorant, town and country. They are certainly amusing tales to read on the surface, but the political implication and social satire under the surface are why The Canterbury Tales stands out from all other books. The author Geoffrey Chaucer mocks the character Chaucer and his conventional writing. It is clear to see what kind of literature Geoffrey Chaucer admires or what kind of author that he despises. In lines 1084-1085 of Chaucers Retraction, Wherefore I biseke yow mekely, for the mercy of God, that ye preye for me that Crist have mercy on me and foryeve me my giltes;/ and namely of my translacions and enditynges of worly vanitees, the whiche I revoke in my retractiouns, It is evident that speaker is not the same untalented storyteller Chaucer as in The Tale of Sir Topas or The Tale of Melibee. Apparently, Geoffrey Chaucer, the author is the speaker of the retraction because he confesses that he is the author who translates and edits all previous tales, the translacions and enditynges of worly vanitees. The main purpose of his retraction is intended to preye for me that Ctrist have mercy on me and foryeve me my giltes. But what is Geoffrey Chaucer guilty of? He is merely a writer exposing all worly vanitees. Why does Chaucer beg for Gods forgiveness? In Chaucers Retraction, he says, as is the book of Troilus; the book of the Duchesse; the book of Seint Valentynes day of the Parlement of Briddes; the tales of Caunterbury, thilke that sownen into synne (1086-1090). According to the notes in Larry Bensons edition, sownen into synne means tend toward, are conductive to, sin (310). The implication of his previous quotation is that all his writings and previous books are tend toward, are conductive to, sin. But if Chaucer wants to confess to God and ask for his own forgiveness, he can easily burn all his books that he thought are most sinful. If he plays it safe with God, it is not necessary to publically explain his sin to all his readers at the end of the book. The end of the book is usually reserved for conclusions or the imperative points that the readers can extract from the whole book. But why does Geoffrey Chaucer choose to include his confession at the end and let his audience read it? What does he want the readers to gain from the end of his book? From his action of letting the revocation stand in the same book with the poems that sownen into synne, we can detect an important message that Chaucer attempts to send to us readers. The key idea is that Geoffrey Chaucers intention is not to ask God to forgivehimself and to repent his sins. Instead he asks God to forgive the sinful characters that he has created and also to forgive the sinful readers. Geoffrey Chaucer is as not sinful as the Pardoner or those corrupted pilgrims and dishonored characters in his poem. The pilgrims have all committed sin when they took part in this pilgrimage, not for spiritual or religious reasons, but for maken ernest of game (3186, The Millers Prologue). They attend the pilgrimage for social interactions and selfish pursuits. They embody sinful individuality that battles with religion. The Pardoner is perhaps the most corrupted and the most sinful character in the poem. In his prologue, he frankly confesses that he is a fraud motivated by greed, gluttony and avarice and that he is guilty of all seven sins. Even though he is essentially a hypocrite in his profession, he is at least being honest as he makes his confession. On the other hand, although other pilgrims are also guilty of sins as well like the Pardoner, they dont admit their sins or make confessions like the Pardoner. The role of the Pardoner in the story is to get men to call on God for forgiveness of their sins. Interestingly, Chaucers role in the retraction is extremely similar to Pardoners, he calls on God for forgiveness of his sins; he also calls on God for forgiveness of the pilgrims sins. Chaucer is similar to the Pardoner in a way that they both share the unique awareness of their own sin whereas the pilgrims and the readers do not. Theoretically, the author, Geoffrey Chaucer has a full control of all the characters in his book. He could have made every character virtuous and perfect, like the verrayu, parfit, gentil knight. If every pilgrim behaves like the Knight and if there is no sin committed, there would be no need to ask for forgiveness in Chaucers Retraction. But Geoffrey Chaucer does not have the power to do that, I preye hem also that they arrette it to the defaute of myn unknnoynge and nat to my wyl, that wolde ful fayn have seyd better if I hadde had konnynge (1082-1083, Chaucers Retraction). This passage implies that if Chaucer has had the power, the konnynge, he would easily have written better, and he would have easily create all virtuous characters and the world would be perfect and beautiful. But what kind of power or konnynge does he refer to? And since no one would have doubted on Chaucers literal talent or poetic abilityhe obviously has the literal power. So what power or konnynge does he lack in this context? Chaucer has his choice to make his characters virtuous or sinful. But to realistically reflect the human reality and the social condition of life, sin is an inevitable and inseparable part of humanity. Chaucer has no power and therefore no konnynge to control his characters from committing sins if he accurately portrays his characters from the fourteenth century society. Even in The Knights Tale, arguably the most moral story about love, honor, chivalry and adventure, Arcite and Palamon are also embodiments of sins such as anger, jealousy, violence and injustice upon closely examination. From the original sin of Adam and Eve, to Radix malorum est cupidatis, the sins are basic elements of human lives and all of us have committed a sin in our life time. In Geoffrey Chaucers opinion, other authors of the Medieval literature have often only created moralizing and unrealistic characters. In contrast, he makes most of the characters realistically sinful. Most of the characters are nothing like the Knight. Why doesnt he just create moralizing characters and tell noble stories? After Knights noble story, why does the Miller jump in and break the pattern of social status, telling a vulgar and sinful story? In The Millers Prologue, when the Reeve objects Millers tale because he was once a carpenter, this story seems potentially vulgar and immoral because Miller is very drunk and everyone knows that he would not tell a tale of nobility like the Knight. This is a purposeful interruption and a critical turning point of the poem created by Geoffrey Chaucer. At that moment, Chaucers response is the following: Hir tales alle, be they better or werse, Or ells falsen som of my mateere. And therefore, whoso list it nat yheere, Turne over the leef and chese another tale; For he shal fynde ynowe, grete and smale, Of storial thing that toucheth gentillesse, (3173-3179, The Millers Prologue) Chaucer says that he is merely here to retell the story. When he asks the reader to turne over the leef and cheses another tale; For he shal fynde ynowe, grete and smale, Of storial thing that toucheth gentillesse, his intention is precisely the opposite. He invokes readers curiosity to read further into The Milllers Tale. Furthermore, for the readers who have read all the tales, we know that there is no grete and smale tales that toucheth gentillesse even if the reader skips the Millers Tale. The tale after The Millers Tale is The Reeves Tale, which is much more vulgar and offensive. What Chaucer encourages is exactly the opposite of skipping the sinful stories, but to read all the vulgar tales and accept the reality, hoping the readers will see their own sins while reading. Why does Chaucer predict the readers may want to skip the vulgar or the sinful tales? It is also a very important question that Chaucer poses for the readers. We, the readers, like the pilgrims in the Canterbury Tales, most likely would not confess our sin and only laugh at others. The readers are mostly likely not going to identify with the sins that Chaucer reveals in his poem. However, it is reality that the readers all have committed many similar sins from the book. The readers are just as sinful as the pilgrims. However, the readers do not possess the awareness or have the guts to confess their sins like Geoffrey Chaucer or like the Pardoner. The tale before the retraction is The Canterbury Tales, which focuses on abstract virtues and the goal of the pilgrimage: immortality and heaven. The Parson also lists the Seven Deadly Sins: pride, envy, anger, sloth, avarice, gluttony and lechery. And he directs man toward penitence and confession. Essentially, The Chaucers Retraction is parallel with the Parsons view. It is significant that the first sin of the Seven Deadly Sins is pride, and pride is the arguably the worst form of sins because it could potentially prevent us to see our other sins. The Oxford English Dictionary defines pride as high, esp. an excessively high, opinion of one's own worth or importance which gives rise to a feeling or attitude of superiority over others; inordinate self-esteem. It is precisely the pilgrims pride, their sense and attitude of superiority over the Pardoner, preventing them to see their own flaws and sins. It is the readers pride, our feeling of superiority over the characters and pilgrims in the book, preventing us to see our own sins in our life. On one level, the pilgrims merely treat the tales as amusing stories by constantly encouraging each other to tell moral tales. They do not realize their own sins are reflected in the tales that they tell or the tales that they hear. On another level, the readers, including myself, would likely consider this book as amusing. For example, readers may only find The Millers Tale to be humorous: the characters are dumb, their farts are ridiculous, and the miller is just a drunken and vulgar man. We may not realize that the fabliaux also happen in our lives and in our contemporary society: many rich old men like the carpenter prefer to marry young and beautiful women; many scholars like Nicholas pursue and desire courtly love. Essentially, Chaucer, the master of English language, advises us to realize our own sins in our lives after the completion of The Canterbury Tales, which is the central message of the book. Sins exist in everyone regardless of their social rank or different occupations. By looking through the characters nobility or aristocracy and looking past readers own hypocrisy, we may find our sins, and Chaucer sincerely wishes the readers would follow his act, admit their sins, and ask for Gods mercy and forgiveness.

ENG.G1.02.1,Seeing Selves in Troilus and Cressida,English,Argumentative Essay,"Whats aught but as 'tis valued?' Troilus' question, posed to Hector as an argument for keeping Helen, articulates one of the central problems in Shakespeares Troilus and Cressida.1 The claim attempts to close the gap between being  what is aught  and being perceived  what is valued  in such a way that ones identity becomes what others understand that identity to be. As the play suggests, one way of conceiving this formation of identity is in terms of the humoral body. The early modern body, as Gail Kern Paster has argued, was an extremely permeable entity, constantly altered by the elements surrounding it. For this reason, she states, to understand the early modern passions as embodying a historically particular kind of self-experience requires seeing the passions and the body that houses them in ecological terms  that is, in terms of that bodys reciprocal relation to the world. 2 This understanding of the humoral body, constructed in relation to the world it inhabits, allows one to understand one of the plays answers to Troilus: that identity is formed through looking. In Shakespeares Troilus and Cressida, it is the gaze of the other that constructs the self, in metaphysical and metaphorical terms. To recognize this, one must trace  however briefly  an early modern theory of sight as a material experience, through Marsilio Ficinos Commentary on Platos Symposium and Andr� du Laurens A Discourse of the Preservation of Sight. At first glance, these treatises seem to represent opposing poles in early modern thought, the former a Neoplatonist discourse on the souls relationship to love, the latter a Galenic treatise on the anatomy of the eye. My reading, however, resists such characterization, as it attempts to demonstrate the degree to which both texts, despite their purported Neoplatonist or Galenic associations, theorize the nature of sight in similar, material terms. Having done so, it will then be possible to revisit Troilus and Cressida, to read the play as negotiating these theories in its treatment of value in love and war. Achilles speech in Act 3 Scene 3 and his ensuing debate with Ulysses function as the literary site in which the arguments of Ficino and du Laurens are refashioned, ultimately rewritten, as a discourse of the selfs composition through looking. In speaking of the self in Troilus and Cressida, it should be noted, this paper deliberately avoids the terms identity and subjectivity as used by Linda Charnes in her impressive study Notorious Identity: Materializing the Subject in Shakespeare. Charnes argument proposes an interesting, although problematic, distinction between the terms: whereas as identity is textually inscribed on characters, bearing the traces of power in its production of the self, subjectivity is the non-textual site of resistance, through which the character relates to his or her textual identity.3 Applied to Troilus and Cressida, however, it becomes difficult to imagine how the characters of Shakespeares play could function extra-textually, as they exist precisely through a textual constellation of signifiers. The paper concludes by suggesting the extent to which Shakespeares play, through its mediation of looking, may be theorizing its own conditions of performance in early modern England, with regard to the bodies of spectators on and offstage alike. As Joseph Roach argues in The Players Passion, recognizing the humoral composition of the body is a prerequisite to understanding the function of that body within the early modern playhouse. On the basis of that claim, this paper applies the discussion of looking in Troilus and Cressida to the practice of looking at Troilus and Cressida onstage. Writing in the fifteenth century, Marsilio Ficino describes sight in terms of the spirits that connect the humoral body to the soul. Although the product of humoral vapors, the spirits animate the body in such a way as to transgress the distinction of corporeal/incorporeal; as Joseph Roach states, Spirits mediate between mind and matter  transforming thought into action, shaping what would otherwise be a collapsed bag of pus and bile into a form in Gods image. 4 Because of this ontological status, the spirits transform sight into a profoundly material process, in which the eyes emit spirits: just as this vapor of the spirits is produced from the blood, so also it itself sends out rays like itself through the eyes, which are like glass windows. 5 These rays, as Ficino proceeds to explain, contain droplets of blood, a kind of condensation of the humoral vapors. For this reason, when one looks at another person, the eyes project spirits into the object of ones gaze. Ficino explains in the following: what wonder is it if the eye, wide open and fixed upon someone, shoots the darts of its own rays into the eyes of the bystander, and along with those darts, which are the vehicles of the spirits, aims that sanguine vapor which we call spirit? 6 As these rays enter the object of ones gaze, they are become blood once again: Hence the poisoned dart pierces through the eyes, and since it is shot from the heart of the shooter, it seeks again the heart of the man being shot, as its proper home; it wounds the heart, but in the hearts hard back wall it is blunted and turns back into blood. 7 Insofar as the body is composed of blood, distilled into different humors, the injection of anothers blood effectively reconstitutes the body, and thereby the self. Looking, as theorized in Ficinos work, entails more than the exchange of glances. Contained within those glances are both spirits and the blood through which these spirits manifest themselves. To look at another person, then, is to invade that person. Shortly after Ficinos text was circulated through England, another treatise on the humoral body was translated and published, modifying the degree to which sight could be understood as material. Andr� du Laurens devotes the tenth chapter of his treatise A Discourse of the Preseruation of Sight to explaining: How we see, as namely whether it be by the sending foorth of spirits, or by taking in of the formes of things. 8 Although he provides nine reasons that prove the eye sees by emission, du Laurens eventually concludes that wee see by receiuing only and that there goeth nothing out of the eye, which may serue for the making of vs to see. 9 If his argument rejects Ficinos claim that the act of looking sends spirits into the world, du Laurens nevertheless maintains a material conception of sight, as he states that in looking, wee receiue nothing but the forme which is produced of the obiect, and adds that this form is a certaine reall thing seated in the ayre and eye. 10 The form, after traveling through the air, enters the eye in the same manner as Ficinos spirits. Although sight does not reconstitute the body in terms of humoral composition, du Laurens theory of looking does suggest the degree the eye represents a place of permeability in the early modern culture. As he states in the fourth chapter of the treatise, the eye, though it does not emit spirits, allows the passions to reveal themselves: as the face doth shadow out vnto vs the liuely and true image of the minde, so the eyes doe lay open vnto vs all the perturbations of the same: the eyes doe admire, loue, and are full of lust. In the eyes, thou maist spie out loue and hatred, sorrow and mirth, resolution and timoroussnes, compassion and mercilesnes, hope and despayre, health and sicknes, life and death. 11 The marginal note, offering a gloss of the text, furthers the argument that the eyes conform to the passions: All the passions of the minde are to be espied and seene in the eye. 12 If du Laurens denies the materiality of sight in terms of spirits that move through ocular emission, he nevertheless maintains that looking is a quasi-material process; not only do the forms of objects enter the eyes, but the eyes are a site in which the humoral composition of a person is made manifest. In Shakespeares Troilus and Cressida, Achilles provides the means of linking this discussion of sight with the question of selfhood. His discussion with Ulysses connects looking to Troilus question Whats aught but as tis valued? in such a way as to make sight a metaphor for the way in which value is produced. Achilles muses that, selves, like the eyes with which they see, know their value through other people: The beauty that is born here in the face The bearer knows not, but commends itself To others eyes; nor doth the eye itself, That most pure spirit of sense, behold itself, Not going from itself, but eye to eye opposed Salutes each other with each others form. (3.3.104-9) Like the eye that cannot see itself, and must know its value through the look that others offer, Achilles puns on the self as another I, one that needs the mirror of other people to know its worth. It is eye to eye opposed that beauty and worth are transmitted back to the I. Achilles traces this exchange of glances to make looking the basis of knowledge, as it is in looking at others, looking back on the self, that the self comes to know its worth: speculation turns not to itself / Till it hath traveled and is mirrored there / Where it may see itself (3.3.110-2). Through this meditation on sight, Achilles refashions the arguments of Ficino and du Laurens to establish looking as the literal, if not quite material, means by which the self is constituted. In attempting to lure Achilles into battle, Ulysses develops this discussion of looking into a kind of philosophy that he then maps onto the Trojan War. He states that The present eye praises the present object, affirming Achilles in his claim that looking provides the basis of both value and knowledge (3.3.181). To explain why Ajax is now the favorite of the Greeks, he extends this understanding of sight in the following passage: Then marvel not, thou great and complete man, That all the Greeks begin to worship Ajax, Since things in motion sooner catch the eye Than what stirs not. (3.3.182-5) For Ulysses, warriors like Ajax and Achilles are valued to the degree that their actions catch the eye of other soldiers. Ren� Girard locates, within this exchange of glances, the means by which warriors, as proud men, come to value themselves: nothing matters more than the looks of other men. These looks, and the desires they signal, must be visibly focused upon the proud man at all times, to keep his own desire well supplied with models of what becomes, for him, self-adulation. 13 It is the gaze of these soldiers, in other words, that enables Achilles and Ajax to know and to value themselves. In making this claim, Ulysses appropriates the relationship of sight to beauty that Achilles first articulates and reifies it in contextualizing this relationship within the pageantry of the battlefield. Formulated as such, Ulysses understanding of sight recalls, and at the same time anticipates, the plays representation of Cressida as a figure thoroughly constructed by the gaze of the other. In the speech that ends her first appearance onstage, Cressida advances a conception of looking that is similar to Ulysses, differing only in relationship to love rather than war. She claims that, Men prize the thing ungained more than it is, and uses this statement to justify the dissembling that, in her view, will make her more valuable to Troilus: Then, though my hearts contents firm love doth bear, / Nothing of that shall from mine eyes appear (1.3.280; 1.3.285-6). Her plan borrows from du Laurens assumption that passions, particularly those of love, manifest themselves in the eyes. Cressidas effort to increase her value in the eyes of Troilus can therefore be understood as a subversion of her own eyesight, an attempt to upset the natural coursing of humoral spirits through the body to their proper place in the eyes. However destructive this plan may seem in terms of humoral theory, it demonstrates Cressidas awareness of the glances by which value is produced, at the same time that it announces her strategy to disrupt, and thereby manage, the system of looking that Achilles and Ulysses describe. When Cressida appears with Diomedes, supposedly alone but in fact a spectacle under the watchful eyes of Troilus, Ulysses, and Thersites, her attempts to resist the Greeks advances show the failure of her initial scheme. If Cressida once claimed to cleave her minds desires from the function of her eyes, she maintains this power still, exclaiming: Troilus, farewell! One eye yet looks on thee, / But with my heart the other eye doth see (5.2.113-4). Here, Cressida refashions the disjunction between eyes and mind in order to maintain a kind of fidelity to Troilus, attempting to preserve his place before the minds eye, while the corporeal eye, tied to the body through the heart, looks to Diomedes. It is the failure of this splitting that, as Cressida herself states, spells her infidelity: Ah, poor our sex! This fault in us I find: The error of our eye directs our mind. What error leads must err. O, then conclude: Minds swayed by eyes are full of turpitude. (5.2.115-8). Cressida attributes the inability to separate her minds desire from her eyes to a fault inherent to her body, stemming from her sex. The suggestion borrows, in a way, from the assumption that the humoral bodies of men and women are constructed differently, women being conceived with less heat and therefore subject to incontinence. As Gail Kern Paster notes, female incontinence refers to a general inability on the part of a woman to control the humoral liquids within her body, one that transcends the body into other forms of uncontrollability: humoral discourse characteristically links this liquid expressiveness to excessive verbal fluency. In both formations, the issue is womens bodily self-control or, more precisely, the representation of a particular kind of uncontrol as a function of gender. 14 In stating that her eyes can no longer be divorced from the desires of her mind, but that in fact the one determines the other, Cressida reinscribes herself in the humoral discourse, as well as the system of value, that she initially resisted. The claim proves, in humoral terms, Gayle Greenes claim that Even in the deepest anguish of which she is capable, Cressida can never lose sense of herself as an object, as an appearance for an appraising eye. 15 Despite her resistance, Cressidas own statements reveal the degree to which she has been constructed through the gaze of the other, becoming an object valued only to the degree that Troilus, Diomedes, and other men appraise her. The structure of looking in this scene, as Thersites and Ulysses watch Troilus watching Cressida, suggests a meta-theatrical framework, one that recalls the distance of the spectator from the spectacle in an early modern playhouse. As such, it returns to the argument between Achilles and Ulysses on the nature of sight, which transforms into a discussion of performance when Thersites enters it. He notes that Ajax, supposedly the favorite of the Greeks, now goes up and down the field, asking for himself (3.3.246-7); Ajax, as Thersites claims, is looking for himself, his worth, in the look with which other soldiers greet him. It is a kind of performance, in which Ajax stalks up and down like a peacock, looking for himself in applause (3.3.253). Just as Thersites takes the words of other and turns them into satire, here he converts Ajaxs performance into a form of parody, appropriating the terms that Ulysses uses to describe the value of warriors. Thersites mock performance, however, exposes the threat inherent to any system that produces selfhood in terms of sight. He, with Patroclus, performs the pageant of Ajax, effectively becoming Ajax under Achilles approving eye (3.3.272-3). In doing so, he dramatizes the ease with which ones identity may be taken away; to the extent that being is synonymous with being perceived, to personate someone in the sense of early modern acting is to become that person. In this way, Thersites anticipates Cressidas struggle to establish herself outside the exchange of gazes that she recognizes as the foundation of value. As Cressida has already argued, against the theory of sight that Achilles and Ulysses present, performance always contains a gap between what is seen and what is felt: They say all lovers swear more performance than they are able, and yet resolve an ability that they never perform, vowing more than the perfection of ten and discharging less than the tenth part of one (3.2.81-4). Her argument is that the spectacle of playing, offered to the lover as spectator, never fully represents what remains within the beloved who enacts this performance. Cressida thereby argues, against Achilles and Ulysses, that sight does not constitute the self; indeed, such a notion would undermine the interiority by which she attempts to establish the truth of her love, inadequately manifested in appearance. Paul Yachnin views Cressida as increasingly implicated in the masculine exchange of glances as the play progresses: Cressideas movement is from secrecy, a conventional attribute of inwardness, to a dynamic doing and undoing of her own visible self under the pressure of the determining gaze belonging to Troilus and Pandarus. 16 The genealogy presented here, however, suggests that Cressida has a nascent awareness of the looks that will later construct her, in response to which she argues for interiority as something that lies beyond the gaze, unable to be penetrated either by the looks of others or in her own presentation. In same manner that her attempt to control looking resists a masculine conception of sight, Cressidas understanding of performance further undoes this theory of looking, intersecting Thersites mock pageant in its effort to appropriate and thereby undermine the claims of Achilles and Ulysses. Following Cressida and Thersites, as they move from a discussion of sight to an argument on the nature of personation, this analysis can now trace a similar movement within Troilus and Cressida, as it presents theories of looking in order to mediate its own conditions of performance on the early modern stage. In examining this meta-theatricality, I do not claim to offer a phenomenological reading of performance, following Jeremy Lopez in assuming: the plays contain within themselves most of the evidence needed to understand what audiences expected and enjoyed and experienced. 17 Rather, my argument is that Troilus and Cressida responds to the material conception of sight represented by Ficino and du Laurens, with its implications for a humoral body, to suggest how playgoers may have conceived their relationship to spectacle. The question, and its answer, have little to do with the actual, lived experience of spectators; instead, this tracing of meta-theatricality is designed to show how Shakespeares play attempts to manage such experience through the discursive work of the play itself. The arguments of Ficino and du Laurens connect to one theory of performance, in which the materiality of sight would have meant a profoundly physical response to personation on stage. In the same manner that looking involves the emission of spirits from the eye of the spectator to the eye of the spectacle, watching a play requires an exchange of glances, and at the same time spirits, between actor and playgoer. As Joseph Roach argues, It was widely believed that the spirits, agitated by the passions of the imaginer, generate a wave of physical force, rolling through the aether, powerful enough to influence the spirits of others at a distance. 18 Within the early modern playhouse, the spirits conjured by the actor in the midst of personation would travel through the ether to enter the bodies of spectators, moving them to similar emotional responses: The spirit moves the actor, who, in the authenticity of his transport, moves the audience. 19 Taking the claim from Francis Bacon that, the strongest points of origin for the signals, as well as the most receptive terminals, are the eyes, Roach connects the physicality of response in the playhouse to the materiality of sight advanced by Ficino and du Laurens.20 His argument, moreover, mobilizes the claims of Achilles and Ulysses into a theory of early modern playing. In the same way that the I cannot see itself, but knows its being through the looks of others, the actor locates the force of his performance in the spirits he sends into the eyes of the playgoer, who then reflect these spirits back to the actor in the physicality of their response. Against this conception of playing, Troilus and Cressida uses Thersitess mock pageant and Cressidas statement on performance to assert a different theory of personation. Insofar as Thersites mobilizes the theory of looking that Achilles and Ulysses articulate, his version of Ajax strutting up and down the field satirizes the claim that one knows oneself through others looks. It voids the materiality of sight of meaning in the context of performance, opening a semantic space in which Cressida argues for interiority as something that grounds but is inadequately rendered by performance. When she tells Troilus, I have a kind of self resides with you, / But an unkind self that itself will leave / To be anothers fool, she anticipates his looking at her when she seems to betray him with Diomedes (3.2.143-5). The metatheatrical scene in which Thersites and Ulysses watch Troilus watching Cressida establishes the two selves that she previously articulates, the one seen by the spectators, the other residing within her as interiority. Cressidas attempt to protect this interiority corresponds to what David Hillman describes as an increasing closure of the body in the early modern period as mediated in the distinction between inner and outer space: the old physiological understanding of sensory activity (such as sight and hearing) as based upon something (eye-beams, rays, waves) entering and leaving the interior of the body was changing to fit in with a considerably less permeable model of the way the body naturally works, the concomitant of a vastly increased sense of urgency (as well as ambivalent anxiety) regarding the need for inner and outer to kept separate. 21 Articulated in terms of performance, as Cressida does, this claim to interiority disrupts the material understanding of personation as a humoral exchange of spirits through gazes. It suggests, as Christopher Crosbie asserts, that Shakespeares approach remains consistently from the outside looking in, and knowledge of the body (which is, by necessity, objectified) becomes a process of penetrating examination. 22 For Cressida, and for Troilus and Cressida as a whole, the spectator who views the body of another from the outside cannot access its interiority; indeed, it establishes this inner space in the very act of attempting to penetrate it with the gaze. Locating this argument within Cressidas own performance, against the masculine assertions of Achilles and Ulysses, the play presents a gendered critique of personation based on the transfer of spirits. It rejects the materiality of vision and, with it, the humoral claim that the self is constituted through looking. In place of the arguments of Ficino and du Laurens, as mobilized by the Greek warriors of the play, Shakespeares Troilus and Cressida asserts an interiority that looking can neither create nor penetrate. It is by this interiority that Cressida asserts her allegiance to Troilus, and by the failure to recognize this inaccessible interiority that he, like other spectators of the play, assume her betrayal.

ENG.G1.06.1,Intergenerational Trauma in Nora Okja Keller's Comfort Woman,English,Argumentative Essay,"In the conclusion to the International Handbook of Multigenerational Legacies of Trauma, Yael Danieli points to the conspicuous absence of any psychological research on the intergenerational consequences of rape trauma1 (671). Later in her conclusion, Danieli articulates the need to specifically explore a further absence in psychological literature, that is the intergenerational impact of a particularly unique form of rape trauma suffered by an estimated 50,000 to 200,000 comfort women during World War II (683). Despite Danielis call for further investigation into the intergenerational consequences from the trauma of being a comfort woman, the gap in knowledge remains ten years on2. Juxtaposed against this silence in the field of psychology is Nora Okja Kellers novel Comfort Woman that attempts to both imagine and render the relationship between Soon Hyo, a Korean survivor who continues to go by the name Akiko that she inherits at the comfort station and her bi-racial, American-born daughter, Beccah3. The novel is told from both the perspectives of Akiko and Beccah. Yet, what threads these disparate narratives that move abruptly back and forth in time through different genealogies is the haunting trauma of Akikos experience as an enslaved comfort woman. In The Intrusive Past: The Flexibility of Memory and the Engraving of Trauma, van der Kolk and van der Hart write, Traumatic memories are the unassimilated scraps of overwhelming experiences, which need to be integrated with existing mental schemes, and be transformed into narrative language (176). Yet, how can those traumatic memories ever be a part of both narrative memory and language when society, and terrifyingly the individuals closest to the survivor silence the very buds of such a narrative? In Telling Tales: Women and the Trauma of Partition in Sidhwas Cracking India, Deepika Bahri articulately highlights the conflicted function of the social order that must make room for the trauma survivor but can only do so by banning the trauma narrative, the survivors single means of catharsis (221). Bahri writes, A conspiracy of silence ensures that the hastily darned social fabric cannot be further rent while individual trauma is sealed within an inarticulate, asocial space (221). In Comfort Woman, Akikos short-lived marriage to her American missionary husband, Richard Bradley, seals her trauma in. Although Richard promises her that it is better to be married than to burn in hell as a fallen woman, Akikos trauma rages on for she cannot speak it. It is particularly ironic then when he holds Akikos face in his hands and preaches, You do not have to tell me of your past, for whatever you have done, you are now cleansed by the washing of the water with the word (106). Here, Richard elevates the Judeo-Christian word above her narrative with the chilling hope that the rites of baptism and marriage that he has bestowed upon her will subsume the words of her trauma. In doing so, there is little difference between the Japanese patriarchal apparatus that enslaves Akiko during the war and then denies the truth of her trauma, and Richards masculinist Judeo-Christian discourse that forbids her from articulating her trauma. When Akiko does attempt to speak the unspeakable, she says, I know what I speak, for that is my given name. Soon Hyo, the true voice, the pure tongue. I speak of laying down for a hundred men& I speak of bodies being bought and sold (195). At this juncture, the word of patriarchy, religion and social order unite to respond with Proverbs 4:24, Put away perversity from your mouth; keep corrupt talk from your lips, or (195). Yet, Akiko continues to speak her trauma until Richard uses the most powerful ammunition that he has, Beccah. He says, It is not for me to judge. But know that The sins of the parent shall fall upon their children and their grandchildren. I ask you to protect our daughter, with your silence, from that shame (196). Richards words are resonant with irony since what research has been done on intergenerational trauma transmission challenges his final line, which mistakenly suggests that the collusive silence of the survivor parent and their partner is a protective gesture for the child involved. In fact, in their discussion of the effects rape has upon victims and their families, Mio and Foster insist that to avoid greater dysfunction from occurring, all family members must be involved in the speaking of the rape trauma and that family therapists should facilitate an open discussion that recognizes that a crime was committed against [a] mother (152). What Richard fails to realize or perhaps refuses to realize is that the unspoken trauma of a parent can fall upon their child as readily as their sins can. Donna Nagatas landmark work on the transgenerational impact on children of former Japanese American internees highlights the psychic confusion and despair that these children experience especially in the face of their parents seemingly inexplicable symptoms after the internment ended (1998). For Beccah, her mothers symptomatology4 is truly and completely mystifying. While her mothers behavior is incomprehensible to this very young child, Beccah has no other choice besides living and functioning within that incomprehensibility. Beccahs minds eye has to normalize her mothers post-traumatic episodes. Perhaps more accurately, Beccah comes to conceptualize a new normal within their household. Beccah says of her childhood, Most of the time my mother seemed normal. Not normal like the moms on TV  the kind that baked cookies, joined the PTA, or came to weekly soccer games  but normal in that she seemed to know where she was and who I was (2). Even in reconfiguring this new normal for herself, Beccah is supremely conscious of the difference between Akiko and the other mothers. This hyper-consciousness of difference ends Beccahs childhood perfunctorily. Beccah learns at Ala Wai Elementary that if she ever found herself in trouble that she should tell her teacher or the police. (5) However, Beccah is aware that the lessons she learns at school cannot be directly applied to her life. She distinguishes between school and home as well as between the lives of her friends and her own, But in real life, I knew none of these people would understand, that they might even hurt my mother. I was on my own. (5) Beccahs real life is marked by her mothers post-traumatic symptomatology. In rethinking a new normal for their household, Beccah actually reverses roles with her mother and takes upon herself the task of caregiver5 and protector. In his study of World War II veterans and their children, Robert Rosenheck (1986) suggests that one possible outcome of children being exposed to a parents symptoms is a desire to rescue them from their emotional torment. Beccah describes herself as the guardian of [Akikos] life and sees herself as especially responsible when Akiko experiences flashbacks of her trauma at night. Beccah recalls those moments in painful detail: I trained myself to wake up at abrupt snorts, unusual breathing patterns. Part of me was aware of each time she turned over in bed, dreaming dreams like mini-trances where she traveled into worlds and times I could not follow to protect her. The most I could do was wait, holding the thin blue thread of her life while her spirit tunneled into the darkness of earth to swim the dark red river toward hell. Each night I went to bed praying that I would not let go in my own sleep. And in the morning, before I even opened my eyes, Id jerk my still clenched, aching hand to my chest, yanking my mother back to me. (125) It was Akiko who once used to quietly watch Beccah the infant as she slept, afraid that she might stop breathing. However, this does not mean that Akiko cedes complete responsibility to her daughter or gives her the freedom to do as Beccah wishes. Unconsciously, Akiko and Akikos trauma exercise great influence over Beccahs performance of her gender as an adolescent. Here, we return to the epicenter of Akikos trauma. How does she become a comfort woman? Undoubtedly, her position as a Korean subject is partly responsible because the Japanese Imperial Army saw the then colonized Korea as simply another set of resources to be channeled into the Japanese war effort. Yet upon revisiting Akikos recruitment, it is her genders location within a patriarchal system that leads her down the road of sexual enslavement. Orphaned, Akiko is sold by her older sister to the Japanese in order to obtain a dowry so that she may be married to their neighbor while Akiko serves at a comfort station. Akiko recalls, Even though I had not yet had my first bleeding, I was auctioned off to the highest bidder. After that it was a free-for-all, and I thought I would never stop bleeding (21). Her body is brutally sexualized even before she is biologically viable for reproduction. It is no wonder then that for Akiko, so much anxiety surrounds Beccahs attainment of puberty. Akiko becomes hyper-vigilant about the changes in Beccahs body. Beccah thinks to herself, When earlier I had cherished the moments my mother paid attention to me, recognizing me as her flesh-and-blood daughter, I now began to cringe whenever she studied me, targeting a single part of my anatomy for any length of time (82). Akikos fear that Beccah will become as vulnerable as she once was torments her and motivates her to look within her own shamanistic trade in order to protect Beccah from ever experiencing the same trauma. In order to do so, Akiko attempts to stall the onset of puberty in Beccah by starving this potential for trauma out of her. Akiko places strict restrictions on Beccahs diet insisting that she eat only vegetarian Korean dishes. Instead of providing Beccah with the nutritional nourishment that a growing adolescent needs, Akiko forces her to drink endless bowls of blessed water sometimes all night until Beccah in an almost hallucinatory state says, & even one grain of rice, one section of orange, one strand of bean sprout, filled me to fullness (85). Not only does Akikos trauma impel her to halt the biological changes in Beccahs body, it is actually successful to the extent that Beccah imagines herself regressing to the point that she is in-utero once again: My body reabsorbed my hips, my breasts, the small belly that sloped between my pelvic bones. My hair fell out, leaving tufts of dry lifeless strands tangled in hairbrushes or in the shower drain & I would soon become as hairless as a newborn. I continued to devour the steam of rice, waiting until I would be tiny enough to slip completely into the world my mother lived in. (86) Beccah is unable to see that her tufts of dry lifeless strands are a distinct combination of her mothers dietary restrictions and her own response to those dietary restrictions in the form of anorexia6. Not only does Akikos trauma both mutate and enervate Beccahs growing body, Akikos trauma begins to infect her daughter in a deeply insidious fashion. Beccah starts to police her body by instituting a daily regiment of self-scrutiny. She creates a deeply disturbing ritual for herself: I learned to study my body carefully in order to find and eliminate the signs of sal7 [italics in-text] before my mother saw them. I sucked on breath mints, rubbed deodorant under my arms and on my feet. When my hands started to sweat, I swiped a layer of Secret across them too. And each night in the bath, Id lie back and wait for strands of downy hair to float away from my body in exploratory tendrils, then pluck them out with eyebrow tweezers. The removal of each hair brought a flash of tears to my eyes, the sting of a tiny arrow. (83) The image of Beccah lying in the bath patiently waiting to snip off the tendrils of her newly emerging pubic hair is a striking echo of Akikos trauma because both Akiko and her counterparts at the comfort station would have themselves scrutinized their own pubic hair and each others with tweezers in hand in order to remove the crab lice that spread easily at the stations. Unlike Akiko who is scientifically poked and prodded at the beginning of the novel as if she were a specimen on the doctors table, Beccah imbibes the trauma of her mothers mistreatment and morbidly enacts it upon herself as she lies there examining her body and purging it of any signs of femininity. Even in her dress, Beccah neutralizes her developing body by [wearing] large oversized T-shirts, which [she] pulled in toward [her] knees to flatten [her] breasts (83). In attempting to avoid the unwanted attention of her mother, she shies away from any and all attention desperately hoping to blend into the background. In this image of Beccah pulling her T-shirt in towards her knees, she becomes a pictorial representation of her mothers trauma. Beccah is a walnut-like knot of her former self, drawing her body inward. She has become her mothers han8. Once again, there is this inescapable return to her mothers site of trauma. In one of Akikos reminiscences to herself, she recollects, In front of the men, we all tried to walk the same, tie our hair the same, keep the same blank looks on our faces. To be special there, meant only that we would be used more, that we would die faster (143). Unconscious of her mothers past as a comfort woman, Beccah replicates the actions of her mother who had to neutralize every aspect of her body from her hair to her gait in order to avoid calling attention to her available body. Actually, Beccah goes a step further than her mother by not simply muting her female body but by masculinizing it. She is called a mini-moke by her classmates, a term comparable to the Southern redneck or Mexican-American cholo (83). Even Beccah describes herself as slouch[ing] over her desk like one of the big, tough boys who smoke[s] dope at the bus stop. (83) This is a particularly striking moment because Beccahs act echoes trauma narratives from actual survivors. In Jan Ruff-OHernes autobiography, 50 Years of Silence, she describes cutting her hair short and unevenly in order to look like a boy and thereby rendering herself less attractive to the soldiers who visited the comfort station (91). Beccahs somatization of Akikos trauma is a striking testament to the ironic contagiousness of unspoken trauma. Despite attempts to control Beccahs body both by herself and her mother, she is not untouched by sexual relationships with men. Her first relationship with her high school lover, Maximillian Lee, is typically adolescent in its violent and passionate avowals of love. Returning home one night after making love to Max at Aku Ponds, Beccah describes her body as smell[ing] clean, electric like a rainstorm on the Koolaus (134). Yet, Akiko greets her with the cry, Stink poji-cunt! and rushes towards her with a knife, scratching it along the zipper of Beccahs jeans before throwing the knife to the ground. Here, Akiko stigmatizes the sexual intercourse that Beccah has guiltlessly experienced by drawing attention to the stink that Beccah initially perceives as clean. Akikos use of the term poji or pussy in Korean is significant because that is precisely the language with which Akiko was taught to see herself. When she begins her time as a comfort woman, the soldiers refer to her as fresh poji (21). By calling her daughter poji, Akiko drags Beccah into the trauma of her own experience of sex as a comfort woman. Akiko pollutes both Beccahs relationship and understanding of sexual intercourse as well as her relationship with Max. After this encounter with her mother, Beccah begins to see the grotesqueness of sex that she did not see before. As she once so carefully policed her own developing body, Beccah now surveillances her formerly carefree lovemaking. Beccah says, And I began watching the two of us making love, the way we groped and lunged, as if from anothers eyes. As if from my mothers eyes (136). As she surveys herself and her lover from her mothers eyes, she absorbs Akikos vocabulary for sex. Words such as groped and lunged are reminiscent of Akikos memories of new comfort women being groped and grabbed at as the Japanese soldiers passed them by. Akikos trauma continues to mutate Beccahs relationship with Max to the point that Beccah can barely stand the sight of him and decides to end the relationship with a Max who is taken entirely by surprise. Beccah describes his utter disappointment and befuddlement with chilling contempt. She recalls, Sickened, I hugged him so I would not have to see his blotchy, swollen face. Nothing, I mumbled. Its just time to move on. I held him, letting him cry, and it was like holding a stranger (136). The image of Max as this stranger seeking comfort in her arms is disturbingly similar to Akikos description of her interactions with certain soldiers that would merely want to spend their half-hour allotments burrowed into our breasts, being cradled like a child (148). Akikos trauma emerges in Beccahs psyche the very night that she rushes at Beccah with a knife through a dream, & I drowned in blood, unable to fight the arms that pulled me under, while the fins of the sharks sliced the water like knives (135). This is not the last time Akikos traumatic sexual experiences infect Beccah's dreams. Akikos instinctively violent response to Beccahs sexual behavior permeates Beccahs adult relationship with the married Sanford. With much distaste, Beccah confesses, I cannot stand the way he combs his hair forward to disguise his receding hairline, then asks  uncertain and vulnerable  if he looks too old for me (137). After having sex with Sanford, she falls asleep only to be plagued by a similarly terrifying nightmare. However, this nightmare plays itself out to a greater extent that that initial nightmare: I twist and turn, trying to land blows on its snout with my fists as well as feet, when I see not the jaws of a shark but the nebulous folds of a giant jellyfish wrapping itself about my lower body, trying to suck me into itself& I realize that it is my mother wrapped around my legs, holding on to me as though I can save her. Instead, I feel myself sinking. I cannot hold my breath any longer and just when I open my mouth to drown, I wake and find my body sinking toward Sanfords once again. (141) The image of the jellyfish rather than the shark is significant because it speaks to the toxicity of Akikos trauma that can potentially incapacitate or perhaps more accurately, consume Beccahs psyche. The silence surrounding Akikos traumatic past is only broken after her death. Akiko does not speak the unspeakable but sings the unspeakable in a tape recording that she leaves behind and has Beccahs name written on it. When Beccah plays the tape, she begins to occupy two psychical positions. She is the listener bearing witness to a testimony of trauma as well as the secondary victim of her mothers trauma who is being therapized by the taped narrative. In her role as listener and witness, Beccah possesses qualities that Dori Laub in Bearing Witness or the Vicissitudes of Listening would see as integral to this process. Beccah realizes quickly that only when [she] stopped concentrating did [she] realize [her] mother was singing words, calling out names, telling a story (191). When Beccah recognizes that concentrating on decoding the facts within her mothers song is futile, it is precisely there that her behavior inadvertently coincides with Laubs argument regarding the ideal listener. Laub writes, In the process of testimony to a trauma, as in psychoanalytic practice, in effect, you often do not want to know anything except what the patient tells you, because what is important is the situation of discovery of knowledge [italics in-text]  its evolution, and its very happening (62). This discovery of knowledge does not simply happen to the testifier or the listener. Laub suggests that both testifier and listener partake in the creation of this knowledge together. Laub powerfully articulates this concomitant birthing of the testimony in the following lines, The testimony to the trauma thus includes its hearer, who is, so to speak, the blank screen on which the event comes to be inscribed for the first time (57). Indeed, Beccah actively participates in the creation of her mothers testimony. She rummages through the house looking for implements with which to inscribe this narrative. Finding several notebooks worth of writing to be inadequate, small and disjointed, she strips the sheet from her bed and lays it across the floor to be the blank canvas for her mothers story (192). Beccah embodies the blank screen that Laub writes about when she adds her own voice to her mothers narrative by fit [ting] [Akikos] words into [her] mouth, syllable by syllable attempting to sound out a word that she does not recognize, Chongsindae (193). Here, that single word becomes a concrete version of Laubs password in which [e]verything falls into place and comes together (63). The term Chongsindae means comfort women in Korean but the translation that Beccah obtains from her Korean-English dictionary is Battalion slave (193). In participating in the meaning-making of her mothers testimony, it is Beccah who captures the lexical truth of her mothers testimony for Akiko is no comfort woman. She is an enslaved human being in the Japanese military machinery. Yet in bearing witness to her mothers testimonial song and partaking in her mothers posthumous therapy that is captured on tape, Beccah, the secondary victim of her mothers trauma, is therapized by this experience as well. In their article The Testimony of Political Repression as a Therapeutic Instrument, Ana Cienfuegos and Cristina Monelli discuss the use of tape-recorded testimony as a mode of therapy. They write, Patients are encouraged to tape-record a detailed description of the events leading to their present state of suffering& the procedure will allow the patients to understand more fully the emotions associated with their trauma (48). In their particular case study, the tape-recording is meant to allow the patient to reexperience their suffering in their own words and their particular tone of voice (49). However, Kellers novel points to an alternative use for that tape-recorded testimony wherein Akiko is able to dispel the silence within which her behavior is shrouded and Beccah slowly comes to understand that she had little if anything to do with her mothers inexplicable outbursts. In Mary Beth Williams article, Treating STSD in Children, she writes, As parents reveal details of the events, children inevitably try to envision themselves in that parents place during the trauma&These reimaginings and fantasies challenge the belief systems of the children and could potentially overwhelm them (118). Actually, Beccah finds herself unable to imagine her mother surviving this experience because she cannot imagine herself surviving (194). Yet, it is precisely in that inability to imagine herself in Akikos place or to fully comprehend Akikos trauma does Beccah come to understand Akiko and Akikos own incomprehension of how she survived this experience. The novel ends with Beccahs dream: I struggled, flailing weak kicks, but when I turned and saw that it was my mother hanging on to me, I yielded. I opened my mouth to drown, expecting to in such heavy water, but instead I breathed in air, clear and blue. Instead of the ocean, I swam through the sky, higher and higher, until, dizzy with the freedom of light and air, I looked down to see a thin blue river of light spiraling down to earth, where I lay sleeping in bed, coiled tight around a small seed planted by my mother, waiting to be born. (213) In hearing the unspeakable spoken, Beccahs terrifying dreams take on a liberatory note. Her mothers trauma no longer ominously awaits Beccah in the abyss. Yet, there is a deeply unsatisfying element to this hopeful ending in which the weight of both Akikos and Beccahs respective traumas is neatly packaged into a single freeing dream. Despite this somewhat pat ending to the novel, what is ultimately brought into relief by Akikos articulation of her trauma and Beccahs listening and witnessing of the trauma is the potential for forgiveness. In leaving the tape behind, it is Akiko who sets them both upon the road to forgiveness. It is a belated apology for being unable to speak the truth to her daughter. Beccah communicates her forgiveness to her mother through the funeral rites that she performs for her. Beccah says, When the blossoms, saturated, sank to the bottom of the bowl, I dipped a strip of linen into the water. Ink-black spider legs&wiggled out from the words I had scribbled on the material (208). What is striking in this moment is that Beccah actually washes the words off the linen upon which she transcribes her mothers narrative before wrapping her mother in the strips. Doing so is Beccahs most touching and powerful gesture of forgiveness for she halts the cycle of endless inscriptions upon her mothers body. Instead, she gives her mother the washed strips as a reminder of the strength she had when she spoke the words of her trauma, but simultaneously ensuring that eternally her mother would speak from within and for herself.

ENG.G2.01.1,Messianic Masochism in H. Rider Haggard,English,Argumentative Essay,"H. Rider Haggard's fiction, like nineteenth century England itself, contains a complex tangle of feelings toward Jews ancient and modern. The semitic discourse apparent in She, in particular, reflects the wide range of Haggard's attitudes.1 These include a grudging, hostile acknowledgement of the Hebrews as historical, religious, and social precursors of Christianity and English nationalism, as well as attempts to relegate the Jews that were Haggard's contemporariesthe Jews whom everybody 'wants' nowadays, 2 as Holly disdainfully saysand who were the subjects of widespread public controversies in England in the 1870s and 1880s, to the ancient past. The discussions surrounding the Jewish question in 1870s England can be considered the broad context for Haggard's representations of Jews. As Todd Endelman, a historian of English Jewry, writes, In the late 1870s & Public attention became focused on Jews [of England] more frequently and intensely than before. 3 This focus on the Jews took numerous forms; in the 1870s, these included Liberal and Radical criticism of Disraeli's policy toward Turkey in the period 1875-78;4 the publication of major novels about Jews such as George Eliot's Daniel Deronda and Anthony Trollope's The Prime Minister; and, as Michael Ragussis relates, a beleaguered but persistent tradition of attempts by millenarian and evangelical Christians to protect and convert Jews in order to hasten the Second Coming of Jesus Christ.5 In the years preceding the publication of She in 1887, the position of the Jews in England became even more complex. On the one hand, Jewish assimilation into British society proceeded apace: By the 1880s, rich Jews had made their way into the drawing rooms and dining rooms of smart society, their entrance made possible by aristocratic willingness to absorb new wealth whatever its origins, industrial, financial, or mercantile, American or Jewish. 6 No less a cultural authority than Matthew Arnold expressed unmitigated joy at the ennoblement in 1885 of Sir Nathaniel Rothschild, the first Jewish peer. 7 On the other hand, the rise of some Jews to positions of prominence did not inspire widespread philo-Semitism. In the mid-1880s, Endelman writes, massive unemployment, which owed little to the Jewish influx, and fears of worker violence sparked the first calls to restrict immigration 8calls that coalesced into a campaign that would endure for decades, often invoking virulent anti-Semitic rhetoric and stereotypes. The meshing and confusion of these varied social, economic, and historical factors produced not only an irreducible complexity of attitudes towards Jews in 1880s England, but also a sense for many English writers that the Jew and the Jewish question were productive sites for the working through and out of many vexing questions of race, class, nation, Empire, art, and identity. Part of the usefulness of the figure of the Jew inhered precisely in the ambiguity that resulted from contradictory notions of Jews as rich (merchants and capitalists), poor (destitute immigrants), powerful (in the figures of Disraeli and Rothschild), and powerless (in stereotypes of the Jew as physically weak, feminine, and ineffectual); as Zygmunt Bauman has influentially expressed it, the Jew had entered modern times as ambivalence incarnate. 9 Building on Bauman's analysis, Jonathan Freedman argues that The Jew functions most fully for [Henry] Jamesand a number of late nineteenth century English writers, including Matthew Arnold and George du Mauriernot as a concrete figure or even as a stereotyped one but as a receptacle: a figure onto which can be loaded all the sources of his inchoate anxieties and unacknowledged terrors. 10 Freedman locates this use of the Jew specifically operating for James in the context of late nineteenth century debates about degeneration. While Max Nordau's theories of degeneration nominated a figure to replace the Jew as arch-degenerate: the avant-garde artist, James labored in the opposite direction: in The Tragic Muse (1890), Freedman writes, it is as if James is tracing out the terms of the degeneration debate in order to rearrange them in ways that will exculpate him and the artistic vocation he claims for himself and in so doing finds himself almost absent-mindedly inculpating the Jew. 11 For James and for many of his contemporaries, representing the Jewish other was thus an opportunity for self-definition and self-defense, and for exploring without eliminating the threatening uncertainties of their changing world. Though their writings suggest that Haggard's set of inchoate anxieties and unacknowledged terrors would have differed markedly from James's, the figure of the Jew seems to have functioned similarly as a receptacle for Haggard's own intense concerns about degeneration and evolution. His tactic in She, which reinforces his support for imperial project and elides the problems of modern Jewry, is to subsume modern Jews into his ideas about ancient Hebrews. The author's biography suggests he may even have had a personal stake in discussions about the assimilation and conversion of Jews, their racial difference, and their social position. According to a tribute to Haggard written by his daughter Lilias, Haggard's paternal grandmother Elizabeth Meybohm & was probably of Jewish blood. Haggard himself is described by family members as having had a big nose or the bold Haggard nosea feature that also seems to be emphasized in the Vanity Fair caricature that appeared around the time of the publication of She. Haggard is further described as, like his siblings, manifesting physical characteristics that were a hint & at some touch of Slav blood in the past. 12 Considering Haggard's consistent attention in She to personal appearance and its connection to social, physical, or moral vitalityHolly, for example, remembers being So ugly & that the spruce young men of my College & did not even care to be seen walking with me; and the name of Leo's supposed ancestor, Kallikrates, means The Strong and the Beautiful, or, more accurately, the Beautiful in strength 13one can only speculate about the author's unexpressed attitude toward his own physical appearance, and the degree to which his Slavic blood and bold Haggard nose may have increased his interest in reinforcing his social and political ideologies through his relegation of the Jews to the ancient past. Whatever his personal stake in representations of Jews, one major factor in the constitution of Haggard's semitic discourse seems to have been the stark contrast he saw between the classical legacy of the Jewsas an ancient and once powerful civilization, like those of Egypt and Greece, an ancestor to Christianity and to the English nationwith modern instantiations of Jews as impoverished immigrants to London's East End, or unpatriotic, scheming capitalists.14 Musing on the question of Jewish nationalism, in 1901four years after the First Zionist Congress was convened in Basel, Switzerland, by Theodor HerzlHaggard asserts that Jewish financiers could easily purchase the land of Palestine from the Turkish sultan, and wonders why they do not follow this course of action: Are they held back by indifference and apathyor, perchance, by the mysterious chain of some Divine decree? True to his imperialist beliefs,15 Haggard implicitly accepts the premise that Jews should desire Palestine as a national homeland. If they wanted to effect such a political change, he continues, they might drill, buy arms, and make an insurrection. I am informed, however, that they prefer to await the advent of their Messiah, a man of blood and power, a Jewish Napoleon, who when he appears will bring about the glory and temporal advancement of the race. 16 The Jews could, Haggard argues, employ the methods of colonialismeconomic and military aggressionand achieve their long-awaited nationhood, but they do not. The condescending and sarcastic censure of Haggard's statement (I am informed, however) reflects this aspect of his ambivalence toward the Jews: why, if they were at one point in history powerful enough to sire Christianity and the English nation, do modern Jews not now have the will to power that would restore them to their former exalted position? Why do they passively await their redemption, Haggard seems to want to ask, and howgiven their debased and degenerate current position in the worldcan they possibly bear to wait?17 In She, similar questions of religious and social evolution relating to Christian England and its empire are reflected in the attention to waiting and suspense throughout the text and in the construction of the narrative. The central circumstance of the novelAyesha's two thousand years of waiting for the return of her lover Kallikrates18provides Haggard with opportunities to explore the relationship of the ancient past to modern religious and social life, and, in some larger messianic and imperial sense, to ask what it means to wait for deliverance rather than to seek power and salvation aggressively in the present. Unsurprisingly, Ayesha's millennial patience was read by more than one of Haggard's contemporaries as a religious allegory. Two years after the novel's original publication, in 1889, for example, a writer calling himself Leo Michaelwith a first name suspiciously identical to Haggard's protagonist'spublished the book-length study She, an Allegory of the Church, with a New York press. Michael's slim book is a wonderfully strange hodgepodge of religious philosophy, personal essay, literary criticism, and unbridled appreciation of She. A straightforwardly allegorical reading, Michael's posits Ayesha as an avatar for the Christian Church, loyally awaiting the return of Intuition as represented by Leo, who is accompanied by Science, represented by Holly. 19 Michael meticulously details the relationships between these figures and the Priesthood (as represented by Bellali), Spiritualism (Ustane), Conscience (Leo's father), Religious Enthusiasm (Leo's mother), and sheer Infidelity (Mahomed), and describes how the interactions between all of these concepts, as prophetically outlined in the allegory of She, will lead to the Second Coming.20 His reading was likely not unique in the connection it draws between Ayesha's patience and the anticipation of messianic salvation, 21 but it develops this theme with strikingly directness: The deeper meaning of 'She,' and Leo, Michael writes, is the Divine Marriagethe fruit of the tree of life that shall heal the world's sicknessthe second coming of Christ to the world. 22 For Michael, and likely for other readers of Haggard's novel, the potential explored in She is for the rejuvenation of the Christian church and for messianic salvation. Michael's interpretation of why it should take so long for this awaited salvationhis faithful decoding of the significance of Ayesha's two thousand years of waitingis suggestive and relevant enough to merit a lengthy quotation. Michael asserts that Ayesha was too much in love with the outward form of Kallikrates, and, for two thousand years & lived in the tombs of Kor, worshipping his dead body. Herein is most wonderfully symbolized the weakness of the Church. It has debased a pure spiritual love with physical passion. It has hovered and gloated over the body, suffering and death of the Jesus rather than lifting up its thought and love to the eternal Christ. Physical passion, physical bloodour theology is incarnadined and saturated with gore. Our Catholic churches and all Christian art repeat over and over every horrible detail of the physical sufferings of Jesus and cloud thereby the spiritual and redeeming power of the Truth he taught.23 Michael argues here that the delay that Ayesha's patience symbolizesChristianity's wait for the Messiah's second comingis associated with an unhealthy emphasis on physical passion, with an obsession with the body, suffering and death. Later in the same passage and consonant with Haggard's attention to Jews both in She and elsewhere, Michael characterizes these regressive or anti-salvation qualities of violence, physicality, and bloodiness as having been first embodied in Judaism. 24 This analysis of waiting for the Messiah, and particularly the paired opposites established herephysical passion versus pure spiritual love, suffering versus redemptionpowerfully evoke Gilles Deleuze's and Kaja Silverman's definition of masochism. According to Deleuze, Formally speaking, masochismlike messianismis a state of waiting. 25 He argues that, The anxiety of the masochist divides & into an indefinite awaiting of pleasure and an intense expectation of pain 26 that appears homologous with Michael's above-quoted ideas about the weakness of the Church: like the individual who, in indefinitely deferring pleasure, calls forth an intense expectation of pain, the religious group or institution willing to wait indefinitely for messianic salvation becomes incarnadined and saturated with gore, obsessed in the meantime with suffering and martyrdom. Silverman, building on Deleuze as well as Theodor Reik's attention to martyrdom imagery in masochistic pathology, provides a clear articulation of how a messianic form of moral masochism operates: The Christian, of course, lives his or her life in perpetual anticipation of the second coming. The figural meaning which this anticipation implants in present sufferings makes it possible for them to be savored as future pleasures, with time folding over itself in such a way as to permit that retroactivity to be already experienced now. 27 Suffering in the present, because it foreshadows and figures future salvation, becomes desirable. Conceptual overlaps between masochism and messianism are likewise visible in Deleuze's statement that Christology [is] an all-pervasive element in the work of Masoch, 28 and in Leopold von Sacher-Masoch's own interest in a seventeenth-century [false Jewish] Messiah, Sabattai Zwi. 29 It should be emphasized that Judaism and Christianitynot to mention the many diverse schools, traditions, and denominations that are grouped under those umbrella termsdiffer widely in their attitudes toward and approaches to messianism. These various theological models should not be collapsed into one another; as a general rule, for example, physical suffering does not in most Jewish theological traditions occupy that same privileged space it does in many Christian theological traditions. As Silverman writes, behind the scenes of the Christian masochism described by Reik is the master tableau or group fantasyChrist nailed to the cross;30 scenes of suffering are less prevalent and less central in traditional Jewish texts, rituals, and art, and to the extent that they are present in the Jewish tradition, they more often, it could be argued, emphasize and glorify victimization rather than suffering per se. Despite the genuine differences and variations in messianic traditions, howeverand though a complete analysis of the conceptual relationship between messianism and masochism is beyond the scope of this paperI would like to propose that there remains in messianic expectation, in almost any context, an essential and inherent aspect of masochism in the sense that the ultimate pleasure of the Messiah's arrival is deferred, often indefinitely, to the future, and the present is therefore accepted as a period of at least relative suffering. Unless one accepts a comprehensively allegorical readingwhich would seem unfaithful to what is at times a highly self-contradictory novelthe text of She does not suggest that Haggard shared Michael's negative view of contemporary Christian institutions as weak in their patience for redemption. It is however known that Haggard was interested, like Michael, in spiritualism and in idiosyncratic readings of scripture; as one of Haggard's relatives recalled, he had his own interpretation of Holy Writ and took it for granted that it was the only interpretation deserving of belief. 31 According to Wendy Katz's critical study of Haggard's life and fiction, Haggard's undogmatic Christianity and his notion of spiritual evolution are both attempts to accommodate to evolutionary thought 32though not, it seems, in a strict Darwinian sense of biological evolution, but rather in the idea of a mystical, spiritual evolution, the movement of the individual to God or an eternal oneness. 33 A notion of the evolution of culture, civilization, and religion seems to have been as essential to Haggard's imperialist ideology, as was his faith in the divine in general. Katz argues that By positing a transcendental force, or intelligence, moving behind the scenes, Haggard presents all acts, political as well as personal, as manifestations of some greater purpose. The rationalization that emerges is convenient because the belief that human acts and their consequences are directed from on high and have a significance we cannot presume to divine encourages imperial servants to submit happily to a greater force than their own and to cultivate a zest for obedience.34 Similarly, the notion of spiritual evolution (i.e., the development toward some greater purpose) as applied to imperialismand, specifically, the belief that the British empire is both a continuation and a refinement of great ancient civilizationsconveniently underwrites and licenses the imperial project in that it bestows the status quo with historical precedents and authority, as well as a sense of inexorability. Positing England as a continuation of classical empires requires, among other things, that the supposed ancestors of English society remain debased and ruined as is appropriate for their position lower down on the historical and evolutionary scale. Thus it is not surprising to find Holly, Ayesha's informant about the modern world, telling her about the destruction of various ancient civilizations: The Persians have been gone from Egypt for nigh two thousand years, and since then the Ptolemies, the Romans, and many other have flourished and held sway upon the Nile, and fallen when their time was ripe & the Greeks of to-day are not what the Greeks of the old time were, and Greece herself is but a mockery of the Greece that was ... 35 These remarks, presented by Holly as incontrovertible history, reinforce the notion of the evolution of civilization by recurring to a natural metaphor for the collapse of previous empires (which fell, like fruit from a branch, when their time was ripe), and by ridiculing the suggestion that a once-great civilization might swim against the stream of evolution and in modern times regain its former status through a national independence movement (an opinion regarding the Greek independence of 1829, that Daniel Karlin calls a Victorian commonplace).36 History marches on, Holly's remarks imply, and the ages of the Egyptians and the Greeks are past. Holly's evolutionary litany of failed ancient civilizations climaxes, unsurprisingly, with reference to that ancient civilization whose failure was crucial for the justification of a specifically Christian English empire, and the presence of whose descendants was troubling on the home front in 1870s and 1880s England: the Jews. Though Ayesha's remarks on the Jews are hardly favorable, she does acknowledge them as having occupied a somewhat exalted position in the ancient world: she refers to the Temple that the wise king built, for example. Holly informs Ayesha that no matter their previous position, the Jewslike the Egyptians and Greeksare ruined: The Jews are broken and gone, he says, and the fragments of their people strew the world, and Jerusalem is no more. 37 Though Holly is supposed to be informed and knowledgeable, this statement seems less like reportage and more like wishful thinking: one wonders what the recently ennobled Sir Nathaniel Rothschild, for example, would have thought of the assertion that the Jews are broken and gone. Holly's statement may appear to contradict his earlier reference to the Jews whom everybody 'wants' nowadays, which, as suggested above, seems to allude to the prominent place of the Jewish question in late nineteenth century British political discourse. Actually, that comment aligns perfectly with this reduction of the Jews to an ancient and long ruined culture, as it appears as the final entry in a list of long dead and forgotten civilizations. 38 Wanting the Jews, in other words, means wanting to revisit the ancient past. In these moments, Holly subsumes modern Jews into the history of the ancient Hebrews, and thereby ignores the social issues surrounding the former in late nineteenth century England. It is on one level ironic, of course, that Holly, as the character who works hardest to bury the Jews into the past, is the same one whom Ayesha and Leo call an unbelieving Jew often enough that in a 1995 essay, Anne McClintock, an otherwise astute late twentieth-century reader of Haggard's fiction, mistakenly reads him as Jewish.39 At the same time, Ayesha's and Leo's references to unbelieving Jews, as Karlin points out, echo Acts 14:2both from the perspective of a nineteenth-century Englishman, and from Ayesha's ancient viewpoint. That these two characters, despite the millennia separating their experiences, can share the Jew as their primary example of skepticism, produces an erasure of the intervening centuries of Jewish existence. The Jews are unbelievers, irrespective of time. Once again, the present realities of Jewish life are subsumed in ideas about the ancient Hebrews. Consistently relegating the Jews to the ancient past, Haggard denies them a place in the present and its justifying narratives of religious and political evolution: he ignores the obvious factobvious in late nineteenth century English literature, at least, because of Daniel Derondathat many modern Jews were waiting with increasing expectations either for their own Messiah (if they were religious) or for a nationalist movement that would restore them to political power and self-rule (if they were secular). Holly, Leo, and Ayesha relegate the Jews to ancient history; as such they deny that modern Jews have anything, in the future, to wait for. Stripped of any reasonable anticipation of pleasure or salvation, even an indefinitely delayed one, the Jews' position is degraded from one of messianic waiting to that of pure ruin and degeneration. As Holly reflects, Without Hope we should suffer moral death, 40 and this seems to be exactly what Haggard's text projects onto modern Jews. The Jews thus seem to provide a contrast for Ayesha's own waiting, which is based on a specific expectation of romantic love, as represented by the return of Kallikrates to be her lover. This expectation is figured throughout the text in terms resonant with the formula elaborated above, based on Deleuze and Silverman, for masochistic messianism. Ayesha's awaited pleasure is both indefinite and inevitable: she admits that the timing of her lover's return is unclear, thereby suggesting the potentially indefinite deferral of her pleasure: it may be when five thousand more years have passed & or it may be tomorrow, she remarks.41 Yet Ayesha has no doubt of her expectation's eventual fulfillment: here I tarry till he finds me, she says, knowing of a surety that hither he will come. 42 Unlike the Jews and other lingering remnants of past civilizations, who are described in the novel as having nothing to wait for, Ayesha waits for pleasure that, though indefinitely deferred, is eventually inevitable. Ayesha furthermore characterizes her state of waiting, if not exactly as physiological pain, definitely as a form of protracted suffering: she describes her existence as [herding] here with barbarians lower than the beasts, 43 and as being surrounded by these hateful caves and this gloomy-visaged folk. 44 Ayesha never explains exactly what the precise connection is between her waiting and Kallikrates' return (she only remarks obliquely that she is afraid she would lose the way in seeking him if she were to reverse her practice of passive waiting),45 but she makes it clear that she lives in these unpleasant conditions specifically, as she says, Because I wait for him I love. 46 The awaited event, Kallikrates/Leo's rebirth and arrival, is unequivocally understood as being earned by the length and unpleasantness of Ayesha's wait, as when she sings to him: Long have I waited for thee, and behold my reward is at handis here! &I have waited and my reward is with me. 47 Literally linking waiting and reward, these lines suggest that it is through her patient endurance of suffering that Ayesha earns her lover's return. As in messianism, Ayesha waits for pleasure that is indefinitely deferred, and like a religious adherent masochistically awaiting the Messiah, Ayesha predicates her eventual salvation on her suffering in the interim. It is not, however, solely romance for which Ayesha has been waiting. Her expectationsas well as Holly's expectation of herhave, like traditional messianism, explicit spiritual and political dimensions. In some sense, the messiah for which Ayesha waits is herself. Holly certainly sees Ayesha as having the potential to wield messianic political power. If a person possessed indefinite continuation of life, as he later is convinced Ayesha does, Holly speculates that this person could no doubt rule the world. He could accumulate all the wealth in the world, and all the power, and all the wisdom that is power. 48 He goes on to imagine Ayesha assuming absolute rule over the British dominions, and probably over the whole earth and understands her in strikingly messianic language as possibly being used by Providence as a means to change the order of the world, and possibly, by the building up of a power that could no more be rebelled against or questioned than the decrees of Fate, to change it materially for the better. 49 Ayesha herself asserts that once she and Leo/Kallikrates are reunited, they will live as it becometh us to live; Leo will rule this England even if it means the current queen must be overthrown. 50 Yet obviously Ayesha does not, by the conclusion of this novel, become a messiah and change the world.51 Viewed from the perspective of what might otherwise have beenbased on Holly's and her own projectionsAyesha's waiting and concern for Kallikrates have at best an ambivalent, and at worst a destructive, relationship to her imperial and spiritual potential. As Holly says in retrospect, although she might have revolutionised society, and even perchance have changed the destiny of Mankind, instead, Ayesha locked up in her living tomb waiting from age to age for the coming of her lover worked but a small change in the order of the World. 52 Ayesha was not locked up, reallyonly her love for Kallikrates and her expectation that he would return prevented her from striking out into the world and assuming a messianic role. That she did not do so suggests the danger, or weakness, implicit in her loving patience. (Recall that according to Michael's allegorical reading of She, it is precisely Ayesha's willingness to wait that symbolizes the weakness of the Church.) As much as Ayesha might try to distinguish her waiting from that of the Jews, it finally allows her no more power on the world stageas a political or spiritual figurethan the Jews' does. Thus waiting, while seemingly prized for the romance and loyalty implicit in it, contains in Haggard's novel only an illusory potential for redemption or transformation. The ultimate absence of value in Ayesha's waiting is exhibited most starkly in the scene of her death. Not only does Ayesha's waiting for Leo prevent her from fulfilling her messianic potential, but her concern for him also finally kills her. It is only to assuage Leo's fear of the pillar of fire that Ayesha once again exposes herself to itif thou seest me stand in the flame and come forth unharmed, she asks Leo, wilt thou enter also? 53 This second exposure, for reasons not given in the text, finally destroys her. If Leo had not required Ayesha's demonstration to steel his courage, she presumably would have continued on in immortality and power. Ayesha's love and patience for Kallikrates do not endow her with any of her unusual powers and abilities; these she gains mostly from the hermit Noot. And ultimately her powers are not enoughHaggard suggests that perhaps no messiah's powers could beto overcome the deterministic forces of history that have produced nineteenth century political realities and a powerful English empire. To the extent that we can seek an explanation for Ayesha's demise within the bounds of Haggard's literary universerather than assuming that Haggard, as a savvy author, realized Ayesha would have to die before he could end his book for reasons of narrative economy, and obliged himself with the most convenient method he could think of to bring this aboutAyesha's downfall is justified in the text by her opposition to what Holly calls eternal Law. In her potential revolutionary power, Ayesha opposed herself against the eternal Law, and, strong though she was, by it was swept back to nothingness. 54 What exactly this eternal Law is, Holly does not specify. But in its operation in She, eternal Law seems to fulfill Haggard's concept of spiritual evolution: in destroying Ayesha, it forecloses on the possibility that the ancient past could bear on the political presenta move similar to the one at work in Holly's, and Haggard's, relegation of Egyptians, Greeks, and particularly Jews to an ancient past. The description of Ayesha's death pointedly reinforces an evolutionary paradigm. After being affected by the fire, she shrinks till she was no larger than a baboon and then transforms into a hideous little monkey frame. 55 These images almost model Ernst Haeckel's ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny conception of biological development, only operating in reverse: as Ayesha dies, she degenerates into a large ape, and then into a smaller monkey. She returns to a lower point on a biologicalas well as spiritual and historicalevolutionary chain. Holly, reflecting on this process, remarks, the frame lying before me was just what the frame of a woman would be if by any extraordinary means life could be preserved in her till she at length died at the age of two-and-twenty-centuries. 56 At the end of the novel, Ayesha, the 2200-year-old woman, is repositioned, back into her rightful place in history. The series of events that comprise history, the conclusion of She suggests, are ordered by a forcecalled eternal Lawmore powerful than any individual. That force inherently condones the political status quo because all of history has led to the present moment in an orderly and purposeful way; the way things are is the way things should be. In service to this conservatism, eternal Law similarly dictates that the pastembodied in the great ancient civilizations of the Egyptians, Greeks, and Jews, and even in a potential messiah like Ayeshastays buried. It cannot be denied that Haggard's novel derives much of its energy and impetus from unearthing the past, as can be observed in the archaeological objects and ancient texts with which the book opens, and in the knowledge about antiquity that Haggard flaunts throughout the text. Yet finally Haggard exhumes past societies, and Ayesha herself as an embodiment of the past, only to rebury them according to the dictates of eternal Law. As Katz suggests about Haggard's belief in a transcendental force, or intelligence, moving behind the scenes, the existence of this eternal Lawopposed to revolutions whether messianic or political, strictly regulating history, keeping the past safely pastconveniently sanctions the status quo that Haggard supported. It also, not as a primary goal but then again not quite as absent-mindedly as some late nineteenth-century writers, enacts both a methodology and a justification for ignoring the political possibilities opening up to Jews in the last decades of the nineteenth century, both in England and elsewhere. Perhaps a desire to obscure his own Jewish heritage, to bury his racial and blood ties to Jews in an ancient and long forgotten past, played a partconscious or unconsciousin the vigor with which Haggard, in She, insists on relegating the Jews, and the past, to history. Or perhaps it was solely in service to Haggard's conservative, imperialist agenda, that the Jews in She are rendered broken and gone, and that the potential for messianism, even when specifically not Jewish in character, is explored only to be finally denied.

ENG.G2.02.1,Dramatic Adaptations: Jewish Identity and Narrative Form in The Island Within,English,Argumentative Essay,"In a 1920 review in The Nation of several foreign plays adapted for the American stage, Ludwig Lewisohn calls into question the possibility of adaptation. Amid far-bought splendors and subtleties, he writes: the mind begins to feel a hunger for the near and known. One cannot live on tinned confections. And every ordinary foreign play assumes that character before it reaches us. Dialogue is the substance of drama and the dialogue of foreign plays undergoes two perilous processes before we hear it from the stage. It is betrayed not only by translation, but also by the actors whose souls and the very modulation of whose voices are attuned in a different key.1 For Lewisohn, the aesthetic problems of producing foreign plays in America are two-fold: not only are the words with which the plays are composed inevitably degraded in translationemptied of the vitality and the poetic force of the originalbut they are, Lewisohn suggests, fundamentally unperformable in the context in which they are produced. The American actors charged with voicing the dialogue of these plays lack the voices necessary for the job. As Americans, performing in American theaters, they are inappropriate instruments on which to play a foreign theme (indeed, his column begins with an unfavorable review of a production of Shaw's Heartbreak House, sharpening his critique from a linguistic to a nationalistic focus). American theater, then, is for Lewisohn the place for American narratives: the dialogue and drama of the near and known. Like the lesser things uptown, his review concludes, discussing the Jewish Art Theater's Yiddish production of The Merchant of Venice, it is the production of an adaptation, and adaptations are homeless, hopeless, wretched things without art or a future (623). That Lewisohn concludes his review with a discussion of a Yiddish production of The Merchant of Venice points to the imbrication of his literary-critical concerns and his treatments of interwar Jewish American identity. The Jewish Art Theater's production of Merchant is his sole example of an adaptation out of English, and, as such, represents not only the process of acculturation, but also the maintenance of cultural and linguistic difference in the American context. All the same, Lewisohn faults the production on artistic groundsit is, he writes, in prose throughout, and not in good prose, and its characters and romantic episodes are mired in a sordidness like that of foolish antics at a masquerade (623). The notable exception to this characterization is Rudolph Schildkraut's Shylock: hoarse and far from volublea fat, graceless, old man. But in that figure vibrates a terrifying force. He asks for no sympathy; he wrenches it from you; he scorns all softness and palliation, but when he falls a world crashes into the dust (623). That Lewisohn marks Schildkraut's Shylock as a figure of emotional authenticity suggests an affinity between his character's homelessness and the homelessness that Lewisohn sees as endemic to all productions wrenched into a foreign context and removed from their original national and linguistic concerns. Shylock's power is linked explicitly to the skill of the actor playing himhis ability to command a reaction from the audience; his access to the character's terrible force. But implicitly, as an avatar of Jewishness, and an avatar in particular of the lachrymose figure of the persecuted Jew whose moment of greatest artistic efficacy is that of his fall, Schildkraut's Shylock represents not only an actorly triumph, but also a figure in which the play's content, its medium, and its audience align. The Jewish Art Theater's Yiddish Shylock's artistic success cannot be, in Lewisohn's artistic schema, only coincidental with the character's Jewishness. But if there exists an artistically valuable likeness between the Jewish otherness of Shylock and the problematic alienation of the production in which he appears from its original linguistic and cultural form, this likeness is an exception to the shortcomings of the production as a whole. Mr. Schildkraut transcends the production; he does not save it (623). Indeed, if Schildkraut is able to transcend the mediocrity of the production in which he acts, it is only as an individual, resonant with the historical and ethnic contexts in which his artistry is situated, but unable to counteract the displacement of the production as a whole. In an article published in Harper's Monthly Magazine in May of the same year, Lewisohn connects the process of identity formation with that of artistic production in ways that strongly suggest his later construal of the problems of adaptation: The world wants [the Jew] to wear one set of physical and social clothes; his conscience often demands another. Every act of living for him is an act of deliberate and difficult choice. Thus, life for him has all the intricacy, the technic, the conscious adaptation of means to ends that belong to art.2 Lewisohn casts the process of negotiating Jewish identity in a middle-class American context as a complex performance: a project explicitly marked as artistic (with the overtones of artificiality implicit in this construction intact); a conscious construction rather than an organic or authentic identity. For Lewisohn, the problem of interwar assimilationist Jewish American identity is its deliberateness, and the unsettledness that this implies. Like the adaptation of a foreign drama, the adaptation of the American Jew to secular American life threatens to resolve itself in homelessness, hopelessness, and wretchedness, the lack of art and the lack of a future. What Lewisohn sees as the necessary artfulness of Jewish American self-presentation in the twenties and thirties is symptomatic of the willful alienation of American Jews from the Jewish narratives through which they might locate a stable and authentic identity. In The Island Within, Lewisohn presents an attempt to work out an authentic Jewish American identity in the context of narrative creation. In his meta-narrative speculation about the means and ideals of fiction, and his considerations and retellings of narratives of Jewish history, Lewisohn attempts to offer a construction of Jewish identity that moves beyond the perils of adaptation, and that is predicated on specifically Jewish narratives. Through the form of the family saga, in particular, Lewisohn inscribes a fiction of ethnic, social, and narrative continuity that explores the tensions between biological and cultural descent. The family, for Lewisohn, offers a structure of biological continuity along which the narratives of Jewish history that provide access to an authentic Jewishness can be transmitted. At the same time, as the subject of Lewisohn's narrative of vacillating Jewish affiliation, the family presents an imperfect location of Jewish continuity. The family saga of The Island Within, then, focusing on the males of the Levy family as they waver in their relationships with the Jewish and non-Jewish worlds, offers a model of Jewish historical narrative in which the personal is bound with the historical on the level of biological lineage and on the level of narrative heritage. Lewisohn's first consideration of storytelling as such, in the second section of book one, firmly establishes his concern with the efficacy of narrative as a vehicle for the transmission of moral content, and with the expectations of his readers. Following a polemical discussion of the lost American ideals of the right of revolution and the duty of civil disobedience, and the devolution of Americans into the duped and stupefied populaceno longer a people, which, dances around fundamentalist preachers and a Rumanian queen (45)3, Lewisohn directly addresses a reader that he sees as already potentially disaffected: 'But we have paid two-and-a-half dollars for a story, not for a treatise!' Have patience, reader; the story is coming (4). The reader that Lewisohn imagines is one who approaches reading primarily as entertainment, maintaining a boundary between the genre of the story and that of the treatise, and finding literary value to be a function primarily of aesthetics and formal experimentationa reader bitingly caricatured as a man lying in silk pajamas in an elegant bed consuming unsatisfying modernist work after unsatisfying modernist work. Against this construction of readership, Lewisohn poses a model in which life cries all its old cries, experiences all of its old agonies, blazes with all of its old and tragic splendor (5). In this construction, stories attain their bite not from the avant-garde, but from the eternalold cries, old agonies, old and tragic splendor. This mode, privileging a conception of narrative heritage, is also strongly linked with the tragic. Lewisohn here values not the triumphalist narratives of American imperialism represented in the figure of Theodore Roosevelt (whom he earlier describes as a weak man, shouting, like all weak and therefore cruel men, for blood and war and dominance and glitter, [who] became the idol of a nation [5]), but the narratives of struggle and martyrdom with which the story ultimately concludes. But if, for Lewisohn, moral narratives provide the reader with access to an old and tragic splendoran epic pastthey are also linked with conceptions of progress and, implicitly, futurity: But dwell with me for a moment on the question: what in fact is a story? [. . . .] Do we know more than the men who came before us? Is our vision more keen and purged? Are we beginning to see the causes of things? Then, in God's name, let us tell wiser, broader, deeper storiesstories with morals more significant and rich. Yes, morals. If a story does not teach by example it is no story; it has no truth. (56) The ability to tell stories with morals more significant and rich is predicated on a sense of growth, a transcendence of the past conceivably at odds with the historical specificity of the stories of the past themselves. It is the moral essence of a story in which, for Lewisohn, its truth as narrative inheres. Indeed, Lewisohn's plea, in God's name, for wiser, broader, deeper stories, signals the sense in which, for Lewisohn, narrative assumes a quasi-religious function. For Lewisohn, the advancement of literature is not a matter of formal, but of moral innovation. Ultimately reconcilable with the treatise, the story is potentially a means of moral edification and can serve, for secular bourgeois American Jews, a Toranic function. Significantly, though, Lewisohn begins his story of troubled Jewish continuity by rooting his narrative in a specifically American tradition, locating it within the discourse of America's founding and the tradition of democratic idealism. Lewisohn's treatise is an appeal to an idealistic communalist ethos over and against the individualistic imperialism of Theodore Rooseveltfor the text, read by the people, and against the idol, worshipped by the populace. The Island Within is a story of the search for an individual identity that allows for a full and principled participation in the national community and in the Jewish community. Ultimately, Lewisohn's engagement with general American themes, takes place through particularly Jewish narratives. For Lewisohn, the basis for American communalism can be found in ethnic identity. If ethnic identity provides a foundation for the American democratic project, then in The Island Within this identity is constructed most directly through the family, which serves as a mode of religious continuity, a conduit of narrative transmission, and a structure around which Lewisohn can construct the narrative of his family saga. The story of Arthur Levy occupies the majority of the novel's space; Levy representing, as the contemporary American male iteration of the Levy family, the novel's teleological endthe figure in whom the novel's concerns with continuity and ethnic authenticity are most clearly expressed, and with whom they might be resolved. Indeed, other branches of the family, remaining as secular or religious Jews in Europe, marrying in America, and in contact with Arthur only during particular periods of his life, ultimately play roles secondary to Arthur's struggle with his own identity. In this sense, they form the particular background against which this struggle occurs, and illustrate the various paths of identification that Arthur rejects or does not pursue. The novel, then, presents not so much the history of the descendents of Reb Mendel ben Reb Jizchock, the figure with whom it begins, as the biological and religious genealogy of Arthur Levy. Interestingly, the Levy family name is itself both a vehicle of continuity and a moment of rupture. In adopting the name that becomes Arthur Levy's heritage, Efriam Levy abandons his patronymic, assuming instead a generic identification as a descendent of the Levites. This shift, a response to liquor manufacturer Reb Bratzlawer's advice that You need a German name to do business in Germany, maintains some aspect of Efriam's Jewish heritage, while abjuring his specific lineage. Efraim's objection to adopting the name Mendel's sohn is a desire not to assume falsely the lineage of Moses Mendelsohn, exponent of the Jewish enlightenment (whose ideological legacy he adopts wholeheartedly) (37). This shift ironically evinces a tension at the heart of the novelthat between family heritage and ideological affiliation (in the terms outlined by Werner Sollors, a tension between descent and consent). The questions of naming, and of the intersection between the specific genealogical heritage of Arthur Levy and his heritage of ethnic and religious memory are pointedly expressed in the figure of the chest of papers that bookends Lewisohn's family saga. The chest, a relic from the west that had always been in the family, and the age of which is unknown, is a fillip for uniquely compelling narrativeseven to Efraim this part of the story never lost its thrilland a collection documenting the family's origins (12). And what was in the chest? Lewisohn writes: Illuminated katubahs, or marriage certificates, gold and blue and crimson, of grandfather and grandmother and great-grandfather and great-grandmother and, andBraine didn't know how many more. And what else, what else? Rifke asked? And a marvelous heavy old ring of gold with the image of a doe wrought upon it, and bundles upon bundles of parchment exquisitely written by hand in the square Hebrew letters and illustrated with drawings. One of these was the priceless manuscript Haggada, or Passover book, from which her father had read, and another very mysterious one was an account written long and long and long ago of Jews who died somewhere in the west a death of martyrdom to sanctify the ineffable Name. [. . .] And one more thing there was in the chest, so far as Braine knew, and that was the jishess-brif, the family-tree of her father's house proving that it was a noble housea house of learned and holy men, some poor, some rich, but all dedicated to study and good works. (1213) Not only a container of memories, the chest solicits active inquiries into its contents even in its absence (evidenced in Rifke's what else, what else?). It is, moreover, also the subject of stories in its own rightits splendor and its loss to Braine's branch of the family instigates its own transformation into legend. The chest, then, is a location of narrative continuity: the figure onto which the family's history, and their connection to a broader narrative of Jewish history are mapped. Here, the katubahs and the jishess-brif authenticate the family's connection to the Hagadda, and the martyrologydocuments of Jewish memory held in common by the Jewish people. At the same time, the materiality of the items in the chest and of the chest itself signifies their uniqueness. Though the stories contained within the chest remain to some extent in circulation, the exquisiteness and the pricelessness of the items themselvestheir physical persistence, symbolic of historical continuityis, for the family, effaced. The chest's absence at the beginning of the novel is a figure of a vanishing narrative. The return of the chest's martyrology at the novel's end is a figure of renewal occasioned by a narratological excavation. Indeed, though the jishess-brif that would provide Arthur Levy's family history at the end of the story remains lost, the reproduction of the martyrology provides Levy with a sense of ethnic and spiritual origins. While Levy didn't, of course, care about myth or ritual or dogma, the martyrology offers him an image of Jewish persistence in the face of persecution that prompts a concern not with recovery, but with futurity: He could read no more. And had he not read enough? . . . How still it was about him! Still as the beginning of things. The only pain in the stillness was the absence of his child's voice. He must try to save his son's heritage for him, his incomparable spiritual heritage. (343) Significantly, Levy gains access to the spiritual heritage that is maintained in the martyrology through his contact with Reb Moshe Hacohen, a figure with an access to Jewish cultural narratives that Levy lacks, and a surprising ability to recognize family heritage without the aid of documentation (on meeting Levy at the Beth Yehuda Hospital, Hacohen initiates their friendship by quickly recognizing him as mishpokhe). Indeed, though Hacohen is aware of the lineage of the martyrology, and though he introduces it to Levy by relating the history of its production and transmission, and of its connection to their family, he is able to abstract the narrative from its contexts and to present it Levy in a version that he can comprehend. Hacohen, in having the narrative translated from Hebrew to English and offering it to Levy, affects a successful adaptation of the text in a way that enables Levy's ideological transformation: his own transformation from an unstable relation to Jewishness rooted in what he sees as an inferiority complex endemic to acculturated Jews to a relation to Jewishness based in pride in his Jewish heritage that can lead to a concern for Jewish futurity. Hacohen, the catalyst of Levy's reconsideration of his Jewish identity, ultimately presents Levy not with the chest itself, but with transcendence of the physical image of the chest in favor the direct transmission of its story. The story around which Levy bases his reconstructed Jewish identity is one whose transmission is rooted in his personal past, but which presents him with a generalizable narrative of Jewish persecution. This story, moreover, is bound as well to the personal relationship between Hacohen and Levy, characterized by Hacohen as well in the context of narrative transmission: Another old saying: The Way is not communicated by any report or any book but from soul to soul (311). Lewisohn's novel concludes with a final act of storytelling by Hacohen. Here, Hacohen details the reactions of a Jew and a gentile to categorical and individual presentations of Jews. For the gentile, The Jew is a devil, but the Jews that he knows are saints. For the Jew, precisely the opposite is true. Moshe Hacohen's story is finally about not reconciliation, but perspective. Both the Jew and the gentile that he describes engage in an act of misprision, and Hacohen's narrative presents them as unified in their interpretive errors. The moral of Hacohen's story, in its relation to Levy as he prepares to embark for Romania, is that Levy should form realistic expectations of the Jews he will encounter. In this final narrative, Levy's subject position is made clear. As an American, and as a Jew who has recently adopted a Jewish consciousness, Levy remains situated between two subjectivities. What has changed, however, is his awareness of where he stands, in the story and in the world, and his ability to construct his own narrative alongside and in reaction to the narratives of Jewishness and Americanness.

ENG.G2.02.2,'City Troubles': Miss Lonelyhearts and the Publicized Privacy of Urban Space,English,Argumentative Essay,"Paris will burn easily Paris is fat Only an Eskimo could eat her Only a Turk could love her The Seine is her bidet She will not hold urine She squats upon the waters and they are oil A placid slop Only the sick can walk on it Fire alone can make it roar Not like a burning barn but muted Muted by a derby hat So also my sorrow City of my youth Is muted by a derby hat Nathanael West, ""Burn the Cities"" Much of the critical debate surrounding Miss Lonelyhearts has highlighted the work's fundamental ambivalence: its refusal to offer complete solutions to the social and individual ills that it identifies or unambiguously to embrace or reject the perspective of either its ostensible protagonist, Miss Lonelyhearts, or its ostensible antagonist, Shrike. For Leslie Fiedler, Miss Lonelyhearts is a focal point for the gothic horror present in everyday life and a gauge of the difficulties of a sincere response to modern suffering, a character, all nerves and no skin, the fool of pity, whom the quite ordinary horror of everyday life lacerates to the point of madness. [. . . . T]he comic butt who takes upon himself the sins of the world: the schlemiel as Everyman, the skeptical and unbelieved-in Christ of a faithless age (1278). For David Madden and Beverly Jones, Shrike, instead, represents the dominant voice of the novel, his ironizing perspective providing a counterpoint to the impotent and deluded sincerity of Miss Lonelyhearts. This view is qualified by Jonathan Greenberg, who, drawing on Lionel Trilling's conception of modernity as a period bound up with the demise of sincerity, examines West's treatment of feeling, ultimately arguing that the reemergence of sentiment (particularly in The Day of the Locusts) in the form of the grotesque [. . .] pardoxically affirms the importance of feeling that satire negates (591). In Greenberg's argument, Miss Lonleyhearts's presentation of the grotesques whose suffering remains undiminished even as it becomes the subject of satire, illustrates the novel's conflicted relationship to suffering and its detached representations. Indeed, the continued critical debate over the novel's potential endorsement of Shrike's or Lonelyhearts's perspective points to an unresolved tension within the novel itself: the oft noted tension between the novel's darkly comic, sardonic treatment of suffering, and its extensive presentation of the pathos of that suffering. This tension, to a large extent, is rooted in the novel's presentation of the newspaper column, itself strongly connected to the novel's urban setting. Sidney H. Bremer identifies the interwar period of economic boom and depression as one in which, for many American novelists, dreams and dreaming were in crisis (275). For Bremer, the city represents to these authors a location particularly unsuited to the fulfillment of dreams. For Bremer, the city, in Miss Lonelyhearts, is mirrored in the newspaper, which epitomizes, the disintegration of meaningful order, the breakdown of social communication, and the loss of personal identity among its New York readershipand, by extension, in the mass culture of urban America (282). Jonathan Veitch qualifies this view, seeing West's presentation of the newspaper in Miss Lonelyhearts as a means of representing of the voices of the city's residents, while critiquing the mode through which these voices are represented. Indeed, he writes, one might say that in Miss Lonelyhearts 'the people talk,' but they do so in a manner that forgoes the myth of pure presence; instead, West focuses on the site or location in which that talk is mediated. Perhaps it would be more accurate to say, he focuses on the function of mediation itself (Veitch 69). Veitch's observation of the novel's focus on the mode through which these voices are mediated is apt, and highlights the novel's central concern with the means and significance of representation. Veitch, in his discussion of Miss Lonelyhearts, argues that West sees the advice column as archetypal of the possibilities and limitations of public communication in the thirties. [F]or West, he writes, the advice column becomes the scene of a rhetorical struggle in which the ideology of therapeutic culture contends with the symbolic resistance of the column's readers, thereby problematizing the colonization of the subject at every turn. Veitch's key insight here is that the advice column offers a break in the hegemony of mass media: a place in which the voice of the otherwise presumably passive consumer is incorporated into the consumed text, and whose problems resist palliation, mitigating Baudrillard's criticism of mass-media as ineluctably one-sided (69). The critical discussion that largely frames the question of the novel's relationship to sincerity and irony in terms of the appropriateness of Shrike's or Lonelyhearts's responses to the suffering masses could be valuably qualified by a consideration of the novel's attention to public and private physical and discursive spaces, extending Veitch's consideration of the newspaper as a site in which the voices of the city are integrated into the text to examine more closely the nature of this public display of private emotions. At the heart of the tension that these critics have observed is an exploration, in the novel, of the intersection of public and private expressions of grief, frustration, sympathy, and affinity. Miss Lonelyhearts is presented in the novel as both a public and a private figure: pseudonymously identified but intimately known to the reader, a public advice columnist with a troubled private life, a man unable adequately to compartmentalize his work life and his home life. Indeed, it is when the separation between Lonelyhearts's textually mediated relationship with his readers and his unmediated personal life breaks down that he begins to be imperiled. This dynamic between the public and private life of Miss Lonelyhearts is mirrored in the novel's presentation of the public and private spaces of the city. In Miss Lonelyhearts, considerations of sincerity and irony are strongly imbricated with considerations of the public and the private. At the root of Miss Lonelyhearts's ambivalent position is the tension between the private grief to which he is called to respond, and the public forum in which his responses must appear. This position, I would suggest, is a function not only of the public frame of the newspaper, but also of the convergence of public and private spacesthe dynamic of viewing and being viewedinherent in the urban environment. Miss Lonelyhearts's excursions into the street, retreats into his apartment, and brief trip away from the city represent an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to find an appropriate discursive and physical space in which to process the troubled lives he confronts in his letters. City life, in Miss Lonelyhearts offers no space for sincerity in the public sphere. Marshall Berman concludes the preface to the 1988 edition of All That is Solid Melts into Air with an invitation to a uniquely public, communitarian conception of modernism: I hope the readers of this book will remember that the streets, our streets, are where modernism belongs. The open way leads to the public square (12). For Berman, modernism is a project undertaken on city streets: locations of transit that are publicly owned, and that open out onto broader spaces of (political) conglomeration. Modernism, in this account, is deeply connected with the unique social conditions of the urban environment, enabled by the city's profusion of spaces of public gathering: the streets that provide the setting for public engagement (or isolation) and the public squares that enable a physical instantiation of mass-consciousness (or the concomitant annihilation of individual, particular subjectivity). As Berman points out, the central drama of modernity, its simultaneous promises of unity and fragmentationa paradoxical unity, a unity of disunity (15)situates the modern subject at crosscurrents of alienation and inclusion. Berman defines modernism as a means of manipulating the forms of modern life to find one's place, and one's agency: any attempt by modern men and women to become subjects as well as objects of modernization, to get a grip on the modern world and make themselves at home in it (5). To make oneself at home in the modern world is to engage in an act of domestication. This process entails a reshaping, both of the self that is made to be at home, and of the world outside the self, which is transformed from a potentially alienating place to one that is inhabitable. In this view, modernism involves the creative re-fashioning of the materials of modern life to be compatible with idiosyncratic individual perception. Modernism, for Berman, is a way of personalizing the public materials of modern life. Berman's conception of modernism offers a way of viewing Miss Lonelyhearts as an attempt to locate and problematize the concept of attachment in the modernist public sphere, and the public space of the city. In Miss Lonelyhearts, the public spaces of the city offer locations constantly in conflict with spaces of privacy and personal ownershipspaces in which sincere personal connections can occur, but only if veiled by tables, darkness, or pseudonyms. Miss Lonelyhearts, a novel rooted in the very public form of the advice column, begins not with a public letter, but with something more private: a note from Shrike to Miss Lonelyhearts that is also a prayer, feigning the sentiments of the advice-columnist supplicant and mocking Miss Lonelyhearts's pretensions to Christ-hood. Oh good Miss L, Shrike writes, excuse my plea, / And hide me in your heart, / And defend me from mine enemies (1). Shrike's prayer, hand-written on a piece of cardboard, highlights a dynamic essential to the novel's consideration of the letter-to-the-advice-columnist formthe tension between public and private, personal sincerity and protective anonymity, intentional display and nervous concealment. Shrike's parodic plea for Miss Lonelyhearts to hide me in your heart, articulates a wish for sanctuary from exposure that underlies the public expressions of grief in the letters that Miss Lonelyhearts receives. The Miss Lonelyhearts column represents for its petitioners a mode through which their grief can be transformed from private to public and their identities can be recast to situate them as anonymous correspondents, members of a community of sufferers. The identification of Miss Lonelyhearts's correspondents as Broken-hearted, Sick-of-it-all, Desperate, Disillusioned-with-tubercular-husband (5), identifies them not only with their problems, but also with their responses to those problems: their desperation, their grief, their disillusionment. With the exception of Disillusioned-with-tubercular-husband, the causes of the petitioners' grief are not identified in the pseudonyms that they offerthese pseudonyms, rather, cast the readers' attention away from the sources of suffering, implicating them as sufferers more generally. Regardless of the idiosyncratic particulars of the causes of their grief, the grief itself, or at least their expression of this grief marks them as part of a publicly defined group: the group of Miss Lonelyhearts's ailing correspondents. The letter that Miss Lonelyhearts receives from Broad Shoulders, the longest presented in the book, offers a particularly rich example of the dynamic of idiosyncratic self-identification and identification with a group of co-sufferers that defines the genre of the Miss Lonelyhearts letter. Here, the letter, not yet processed, typeset, or given a response, retains an identity that is simultaneously idiosyncratic and general. This letter physically stands out from the other lettersits envelope is dirty and bulkybut, insofar as the suffering that it contains is pulled from a pool of common suffering, it may as well be any other letter, and its writer, Broad Shoulders, remains undifferentiated from all other writers to the columnist outside of the letter itself. The only physical description that Broad Shoulders offers of herself is, in fact, descriptive only of what she is not, and normativizing: dont think I am broad shouldered but that is the way I feel about life and me I meanBroad Shoulders takes care to explain that she is only metaphorically broad-shouldered, that her body conforms to normative definitions of womanhood, and that aside from having had more than her share of troubles, she is just like everyone else (43). Though the letter is rich with the particular details of Broad Shoulders's woe (dollar amounts of pensions, child support rendered and withheld, and income from her boarder; names of hospitals, cities, and streets; and ages of children) Broad Shoulders's purpose in writing the letter is to receive a formulaic kind of consolation: Being an admirer of your column because you give such good advice to people in trouble as that is what I am in also I would appreciate very much your advising me what to do after I tell you my troubles. (40) It is, of course, not surprising that a writer to a newspaper advice columnist would expect a predictable kind of good advice to people in trouble. Indeed, Miss Lonelyhearts's authority (Are-you-in-trouble?Do-you-need-advice?Write-to-Miss-Lonleyhearts-and-she-will-help-you [1]) is rooted in a promise of reliability and public accessibility. Broad Shoulders knows that the advice that she will receive is likely to be good because she has read other advice in the Miss Lonelyhearts column and thought it to be useful. But, importantly, Broad Shoulders's request for help is also a form of self-identification with the publicized other-people-in-trouble of Miss Lonelyhearts's column (that is what I am in also). Significantly, Broad Shoulders acknowledges that the help that she asks of Miss Lonelyhearts is to a large degree intangible, if not entirely unnoticeable: please put a few lines in your column when you refer to this letter so I will know you are helping me (43). Without an explicit acknowledgment that Miss Lonelyhearts is responding to her letter in particular, Broad Shoulders has no way of knowing if she is being helped, or if the advice that Miss Lonelyhearts offers, presumably as applicable to Broad Shoulders's situation as to anyone else's, can be claimed as her own. The help offered by the Miss Lonelyhearts column, then, is primarily the acknowledgement of suffering in the public medium of the newspaper column. Indeed, the help that Broad Shoulders yearns for, at least to the extent that Miss Lonelyhearts is able to provide it, does not effect the conditions of Broad Shoulders's life, but only those of the discourse in which that life is situated. If Broad Shoulders's letter represents an introduction of her problems into the public sphere, however, her particular problems relate to the nightmarish instability and inhospitability of her private, domestic space: [. . .] please forgive me for saying such nasty things as I had to give you an idea of what is going on in my home. Every woman is entitled to a home isnt she? (43, emph. added). Broad Shoulders's grievance is that the domestic space to which she is entitled has been violated by her husband's unpredictable and abusive behavior and by her boarder's unwelcome sexual advances. Her letter to Miss Lonelyhearts is an attempt to render that hellish private space public. Her compulsion to reveal what goes on in her home, incorporated into the public discursive space of the newspaper, is a way of metonymically incorporating the private degradations of her home life into the discursive world of the street. For Miss Lonelyhearts, though, the inability to produce a sincere response to the expressions of private grief occasions his own ultimately failed attempts to delimit a private domestic space separated from the world of his letters. Following his tryst with Fay Doyle, the first significant imbrication of his life with the lives of his petitioners, Miss Lonelyhearts retreats to his apartment, where he remains until Betty brings him out to the cabin in which she grew up. For Betty, the countryside represents an alternative to the troubles of New York: She told him about her childhood on a farm and of her love for animals, about country sounds and country smells and of how fresh and clean everything in the country is. She said that he ought to live there and that if he did he would find that all his troubles were city troubles. (32) But despite Betty's somewhat nostalgic faith in the curative powers of country life, Miss Lonelyhearts's and Betty's trip to the country foregrounds the extent to which life outside of the urban environment is, for them, unsustainable. The animals that they encounter are quaint during the day, but annoying at night (A screech owl made a horrible racket somewhere in the woods and when it quit, a loon began down on the pond. The crickets made almost as much noise as the loon [37]). The fires that they make are built with broken-down chairs and tables. Rather than construct a sustainable domestic space in the country, Miss Lonelyhearts and Betty's stay in Betty's childhood home is contingent on the destruction of the paraphernalia of domesticity. For Betty, the house in the country is a retreat because its smell is not a human smell (36), and indeed, the country reveals itself to be, for them, a location only suitable for visiting and not for human habitation. If Miss Lonelyhearts's troubles are city troubles, then he is also, unavoidably, a city person. It is in the context of a return from the countryside, from Betty's failed attempt to cure Miss Lonelyhearts of the melancholy that had caused his retreat into the private space of his apartment, that Lonelyhearts turns to the letters on his desk as a form of therapy. Miss Lonelyhearts returns from the country to a New York populated by crowds of people [who] moved in a dream-like violence. These crowds, with their broken hands and torn mouths, present themselves to Miss Lonelyhearts as potential receivers of the salvation he has to offer: he was overwhelmed by the desire to help them, and because this desire was sincere, he was happy despite the feeling of guilt which accompanied it (39). In the context of his despair over the generally miserable condition of urban life, he reads Broad Shoulders' letter, for the same reason that an animal tears at a wounded foot: to hurt the pain (39). In reading the letter to hurt the pain, Miss Lonelyhearts engages in a form of textual consumption that mirrors and inverts the consumption that he observes in the city. Where the staggering man and the ragged woman look to a puerile version of dreams as a means of escaping their misery, Miss Lonelyhearts immerses himself in his correspondents' misery as a palliative for his own despair at his inability sincerely to express his desire to help the ailing urbanites. In this sense, Miss Lonelyhearts's relationship to the letters that he receives is almost precisely the relationship of the letter writers to each other. By reading Broad Shoulders's letter, he reinforces his own suffering, aligning himself with his disillusioned correspondents. This alignment, of course, occurs not in the public discursive space of the newspaper, but in the private space of the newspaper office. Miss Lonelyhearts's consumption of the letter, then, is a moment not of engagement with the sadness of urban life, that he, described by West as a priest of our time who has had a religious experience, seeks to mitigate, but of disengagement with his own powerlessness to provide effective relief or meaningful advice (Novels and Other Writings 401). This powerlessness is parodied in Shrike's party-game: Everyman his Own Miss Lonelyhearts. Shrike describes the game as one in which each of you will do his best to answer one of these letters, then, from your answers, Miss Lonelyhearts will diagnose your moral ills. Afterwards he will lead you in the way of attainment (52). Shrike's parody, here, is directed at Miss Lonelyhearts in several ways. While the party guests are to play the role of Miss Lonelyhearts in regard to the letters, Miss Lonelyhearts is to retain his role regarding themthough Shrike has the party-goers diagnose the correspondents, their diagnoses are to provide fodder for the further diagnoses of their own moral ills. The game thus situates Miss Lonelyhearts as both the sham expert (as everyone, indeed, can be his own Miss Lonelyhearts) and as the subject in need of diagnoses. But if the parody of the game is explicitly directed at Lonelyhearts, the game itself highlights a central moral paradox of the Miss Lonelyhearts letters: though the letters are intended ultimately for public consumption in the newspaper column, their presence at the party reads as a violation of trust. Where Miss Lonelyhearts searches for a way to express a sincere response to the pathos that presents itself on his desk each day, for Shrike and the other party attendants, the Miss Lonelyhearts letters are fodder for play and enjoyment. Absent the mediation of newsprint, the letters retain their auras of original products of suffering individuals expressing a sincere plea for help. Before they are rendered into type, the letters are documents uneasily situated between the public and the private sphere: requests to a specific, if somewhat illusory figure who promises, if nothing else, a sympathetic ear. In making them the subject of a party game (reinscribing the sense in which the column itself is intended as a joke), Shrike enters these letters into a specifically non-sympathetic community: the community of ironists. This community, importantly, is closed: assembled in a private apartment, accessible only to invited guests. The introduction of the letters into this social environment makes them the subject not of public sympathy but of semi-public ridicule and semi-private excitement. The letters are forays into the public sphere addressed to a specific recipient. In shifting the frame of their reception, in marking them as artifacts of a community alien to that of the ironists, Shrike denies them their original significance. Nowhere are the effects of this more clear than in the very personal letter from Peter Doyle included in the set of letters read at the party. Shrike, in reading the letter from Doyle only after Miss Lonelyhearts has left, interrupts the chain of correspondence that Miss Lonelyhearts and Doyle had established, denying Lonelyhearts warning of Doyle's intentions and further imperiling him. Miss Lonelyhearts's relationship with the Doyles from the very beginning breaks the conventions of anonymity and public-ness that define the rest of the letters presented in the novel. Fay Doyle's letter signals her interest in Miss Lonelyhearts by breaking with the illusion of one-way communication and including her phone-number in her letter. By providing a way for Miss Lonelyhearts to contact her, indicating her knowledge that Miss Lonelyhearts is a man, and revealing that she has seen Miss Lonelyhearts before at the speakeasy, Fay shifts the location of the discourse from the public back to the private sphere, and implicitly shifts the mode of help offered by Miss Lonelyhearts from the advisory to the sexual, collapsing the distance between them, and implicating Miss Lonelyhearts in a two-way relationship. Peter Doyle, similarly, in his letter to Miss Lonelyhearts, delivered in person, requests that Miss Lonelyhearts reply to him not in his column, but personally, ostensibly so that his wife won't discover that he has written to him. Doyle's presence while Miss Lonelyhearts reads his letter reinforces the extent to which the letter represents a somewhat desperate articulation of Doyle's need to unburden himself. The location of Doyle's meeting with Miss Lonelyhearts is significant: they are together in Delehanty's the location of much of Lonelyhearts's other social interaction throughout the rest of the novel, and the most well populated non-work environment in the story. In meeting here, Doyle connects with Miss Lonelyhearts on a level unmistakably different from that of the newspaper. Their meeting ends with them holding hands silently under the tablecarving out a small space of private physical intimacy in public; physically instantiating the public/private space of the Miss Lonelyhearts column. Miss Lonelyhearts's interactions with the Doyles present the most involved interweaving of the lives of his readers with his own life, and the merger of these two aspects of his identity ultimately results in violence. It is only with the Doyles that Miss Lonelyhearts articulates his message, and it is in the context of their physical proximity to him that his message appears to him to be ridiculous. In offering advice to Fay and Peter Doyle, Miss Lonelyhearts attempts to transcend the constraints of his advice column and fails, first producing something akin to the column itself, and then, in his attempt to invoke God, emulating Shrike. Outside of the column, Miss Lonelyhearts finds that it is not his advice, but himself that Fay is attracted to, and in frustration, he beats her until she releases him. This moment of violence highlights the extent to which Miss Lonelyhearts can in some ways only exist as a public figure or a private figure, but never both simultaneously. Though he may enter into the apartments of people like the Doyles through the paper, and though he may bring the troubles of their apartments to the street in the same form, his own physical entrance into that world as an embodiment of his columnist persona problematic. Where the position of the columnist is distanced from that of the readers while maintaining an illusion of intimacy, the position of the private individual is actually intimate. Miss Lonelyhearts's violent physical reaction to Fay Doyle's advances stems from his inability to accept his role as actor, rather than mediator in the lives of the couple. Ultimately, Miss Lonelyhearts dies caught literally between public and private spaces, killed in his apartment hallway, halfway down the stairs, by a gun hidden in a newspaper. The scene of his death represents the final intersection ofand confusion ofhis public and private roles. Unaware of Doyle's intentions, still attempting to act out his position as savior figure, Lonelyhearts throws himself on the figure of the private violence underlying the public medium of the newspaper. In those moments in which Miss Lonelyhearts's relationship to his readers/ correspondents shifts from the public to the private spherefrom the discursive world of the city street to the discursive world of the apartment bedroomMiss Lonelyhearts shifts the focus of his correspondents away from the mode through which their discourse is mediated, stripping them of their pseudonymous anonymity, and exposing their problems, privately, to view. This shift in discursive location, mirroring the instability of public and private in the urban environment that West constructs, contains the potential for violent public reactions to private shame. Considering Miss Lonelyhearts in terms of its treatment of public and private space, as I have in this paper, allows us to reconsider the novel in terms of its relationship to interiority, and to the detached modernist subject. If the letters that Miss Lonelyhearts receives represent attempts to mitigate the detachment of modern urban lifein which subjects are constituted as alienated individuals in the vast crowds of the cityby publicizing the details of private grief while maintaining the protection of anonymity, they also represent an attempt to carve out a private space in the public sphere. In West's poem, Burn the Cities, Paris burns, Not like a barn but muted / Muted by a derby hat, in the same way that the speaker's sorrow / City of my youth / Is muted by a derby hat (459). Where the destruction of the country roars loudly, the signifier of the destruction of the city is dampened by the symbol of public urbanity: the hat worn in the street. For West, in Burn the Cities, the city is not only a place of fire and destruction (and, elsewhere in the poem, filth, art, order, and disorder) but it is also a place of containment and inwardness. It is in the city presented in this poem that the modernist subject resides, somewhere between conflagration and muted sorrow. In Miss Lonelyhearts, too, the city is a location of mutedness and conflagration: of private sorrow displayed anonymously on the public stage, erupting occasionally into public and private violence. The city troubles of the novella are the troubles of modernism: the troubles of navigating between poles of detachment and involvement, and public and private selves.

ENG.G2.03.1,Domesticity in Cold War Black Fiction on the Left,English,Argumentative Essay,"� Who knows the lives and minds of the people who live in the alley? asks the opening page of Willard Motley's 1947 novel, Knock on Any Door. Is Motley using the contemporary fixation on documenting the abberant lives of racial minorities in Chicago's South Side? Or is he making fun of this same trend, implying that nobody can ever know the lives of the poor? Or is he critiqueing readers of African American biography as ethnography, readers who engage in projects of both pathologizing and celebrating Blacks for nonnormative sexual practices? All three attitudes  critique, exploitation, and mocking irony  persist in the tone of Motley's portraits of racial and sexual minorities and their relationship to the city. Anne Petry's 1953 novel The Narrows also simultaneously exploits and critiques sensational narratives of the perverse sexual practices of the African American urban poor, focusing on an interracial affair between a Black bartender, Link Williams, and a married white Heiress, Camilo Treadway. Both Petry and Motley take the physical places of both normative and nonnormative sexuality very seriously, placing their characters in conflicts with their neighborhoods, domestic spaces, and even their bedroom furniture. In Chicago and New York, between 1920 and 1930, as waves of African American migrants moved to urban centers, these impoverished communities became a key area of societal investigation (by social workers, Bureaus of Social Hygeine, and urban planners).1 In both cities, vice districts of the outlaw sexualities migrated into African American neighborhoods and brought new communities into being around nonnormative gender, racial and sexual practices.2 Vice districts were areas where the usual codes of erotic object choice (gendered and racialized) broke down, making space for interracial couples, homosexuals, and subversions of societal decorum. Motley and Petry use these spaces as scenes of the danger and appeal of modernity, with its breakdown of normative domestic heterosexuality and its spatial impermanence. In this paper, I consider two African American authors of the post-war period, Willard Motley and Ann Petry, who refashion these narratives of the African American neighborhood to trouble the boundaries between racial and sexual transgressions and the normative space of the heterosexual home. Both Motley and Petry simultaneously exploit and critique the sexualization of geography that is a convention of slumming narratives. While Motley belongs more directly to a gay male tradition of nonnormative gender and racial portraits, Petry's The Narrows also destroys the reformist illusion that normative, heterosexual households are the way to uplift the race. Petry's reclaiming of the domestic space for homoerotic attachments between women runs alongside her critique of the heteropatriarchal assumptions that usually organize home. Calling attention to the ways that vice in embedded in the very marital trappings that reformers urge onto urban Blacks, Petry powerfully subverts the heterosexual/homosexual binary that structures the idea of certain races, or certain neighborhoods, as inherently perverse. Willard Motley's 1947 novel Knock on Any Door also provides a trenchant critique of heteropatriarchal models of home through descriptions of the married home as a sterile space of violent gender and racial policing. Like the earlier tradition of slumming narratives, the reader of Knock on Any Door is encouraged to form a kind of homoerotic attachment to Nick, the story's no good protagonist.3 As Kevin Mumford explains in Interzones, slumming narratives (such as Nigger Heaven, The Walls of Jericho, or White Women/Colored Men) are characterized by black/white homoeroticism and the sexualization of the African American neighborhood as a specific space or geography.4 Motley's vision of Chicago's street life involves a fantasy of multi-racial community that embraces interracial and homosexual attachments. Motley was unsurprisingly encouraged in his literary endeavors by Carl Van Vechten,5 the author of Nigger Heaven and a great influence in the continuation of homoerotic multiracial literature.6 Because of the novels' engagements with Popular Front aesthetics, as well their slightly queer sensibility in regards to both racial and sexual binaries, Knock on Any Door and The Narrows have been mostly overlooked within traditional versions of African American and Gay literary history. While neither novel provides unambiguous images of the racially and sexually perverse subject, both draw attention to the dangers of contemporary domestic ideologies and their conflations of gender, sexuality and race into knowable and manageable categories. Knock on Any Door's protagonist, the pretty boy gangster Nick Romano is an Italian-American, working class alter-boy turned police murderer. While his defense lawyer provides the classic Marxist analysis of how Nick's poverty caused his slide into no good street life, the novel provides other explanations for the kinds of relations between men that the street allows and the domestic space makes impossible. Motley portrays the Nick's home as a strictly patriarchal space that attempts to fix racial categories through imposing standards of masculine heterosexuality while refusing the material resources needed to maintain these standards. Nick's father is simultaneouly stripped of his ties to his ethnic community and his means of supporting his family when his Italian foods store falls victim to the depression: Then they were poor. 7 After this fall, nothing in the Romano household lines up with normative gender, sexual or racial normativity. Abbie Crunch, the female protagonist of The Narrows, opens the novel by preparing herself meticulously for going for groceries  straightening her gloves and hat before a full length mirror. Abbie's opening monologue also illustrates the symbolic meanings of the street as opposed to her house, Number Six Dumble Street. The street, where most of the novel takes place, runs alongside the River Wye. Abbie reflects, Fortunately the river hadn't changed, but remains, a sparkling blue river just at the foot of the street, a beautiful river (4). She continues, Even the street was beautiful. It sloped gently down toward the river. But the signs on the buildings dispelled the illusion of beauty. . . . Room for Rent, Lady Tenant Wanted, Poro Method Used, Get Your Kool-Aid Free, Tenant Provide Own Heat, Rooms Dollar and Half A Night. Rooms. Rooms. 8 Abbie's description of Dumble Street introduces the novel's symbolic contrasts between modernity and nature, as well as homelessness and home that dominate The Narrows. The signs tell the story of the change from Dumble street as an ethnic White immigrant neighborhood to almost wholly Black. It is not only that the signs, with their neon lights contrasting the natural light of the moon, represent the placelessness of the African American poor within bootstraps narratives about immigration, but the specific signs on Dumble street concretely show the transience of its population. Dumble Street's abundance of Rooms and more Rooms, seems connected to the way that moving to Dumble Street guarantees Petry's characters a life of sordid Police negligence or corruption. Both the changefulness of the neighborhood and its diversion from nature can be read as about sexual perversion. But Abbie's thouhgts of the river as providing the illusion of beauty points up the emptiness of the facades of normative gender and sexual relationships in The Narrows. Abbie is particularly offended by one particular sign and place on Dumble Street. She observes that the sign outside The Last Chance, the bar right across the street from Abbie Crunch's house, is a bright red neon, a horrible color in the sunlight. 9 The contrast between Petry's descriptions of the neon signs and the natural beauty of the river highlights that Dumble street is indeed the last chance for home most of The Narrows characters. Abbie reflects, The people who lived here near the waterfront fumbled and they mumbled and they stumbled and they tumbled, ah, yes, make up a word  dumbled. 10 Thus the language used to describe and name the street comes together with its inhabitants actions, which are anything but firm, stable and homely. In contrast to Dumble Street, the Treadway Mansion's stability (in being entailed through the generations of the family) and isolated privacy allows the Treadways to shield themselves from the lives of the people of Monmouth while exploiting their labor in making guns needed in the Cold War arms build-up.11 At this point in the novel, Abbie lays out a seemingly neat contrast between the unruly space of Dumble Street and her house as a domestic haven of decorum. Petry both uses and undermines this distinction. In The Narrows, Dumble Street's residents struggle to possess not only their houses, but each other. Petry makes the two into inseparable processes, pointing out the way that normative sexuality commodifies not only the domestic sphere but the gender and humanity of its characters. Link's literal homelessness comes together with his needing to escape into motion pictures that provide the fantasy of conquering the world. Petry shows how Black urban displacement and modernism come together with post-war narratives of masculinity in the first conversation between Link and Camilo Williams; ""Honey,"" he said, ""I'm the day man behind the bar in The Last Chance. And I'm perfectly content to be just that and nothing more. Any itch I ever had in my soul, any run-around I ever had in my heel, I lost when I grew up. You only get those world-conqueror ideas when you're eight years old. After that  uh-uh."" Why did you feel as though you could conquer the world? I don't know exactly. That was a long time ago and I was just a kid. All I remember is that I had seen a new world, found a new world, a new continent, and like all discoverers I decided to conquer it, make it mine. 12 Despite Link's claims that he has grown out of such mass-marketed narratives of masculinity, his actions belie his words. Not only does this scene take place in a car, a key symbol in The Narrows of both Link and Camilo's desire to escape the clutches of respectable, domestic heterosexuality, but Link also clearly views his white passenger as another such conquerable continent. Camilo Williams/Treadway (we only learn her real last name as Link does in the middle of the novel) also uses her car to escape from home and its implied class, racial and gender values. Camilo's gender-bending behavior as a driver, the way she claims to own the road like she owns the rest of the Monmouth world, marks her as an unhappily married woman. Later in the novel, Link stumbles out of The Last Chance bar, after refusing to be scared of Bill Hod and announcing that he is in love (thus breaking from the codes of Black masculinity which dominate The Last Chance. Link stands outside the bar laughing, because once again he felt as though he could conquer the world. 13 In his discussion of the modern technology of the movie theater, through the mutual masturbation scene from Native Son, Roderick Ferguson ties the automobile and the movie theater more directly together as symbols of modernity and the racial and sexual perversions it creates; Like the automobile, the movie theater helped American youth commit social transgressions. 14 Link and Camilo's mutual desire to escape their normative heterosexual homes is dangerously close to signaling a kind of homosexuality, the kind on display in Wright's imagination of the movie theater  where two black boys masturbate together in front of the image of the white female heroine, inaugerating them into a system of heterosexual masculinity where they are taught to both own their sexual partners and also that the most desirable partners are those they can not have, like white women.15 Link's rejection of Abbie's household, then, symbolizes both his perverse and modern desires, brought out in his first communicating with Camilo inside an automobile. The terms of power in Link and Camilo's relationship are set up in this initial encounter. They come together in their desire to escape sexuality restrictive homes, but once they look for a stable room to spend the night in, their racial and class power differentials begin to fester. Link can't get over Camilo's importing nice furniture, specifically a bed, into their hotel room. In lingering on the symbols of domestic sexuality (particularly the bed that Camilo buys for the hotel room) as manifestations of Camilo's power over Link, and setting this scene of travel as the couple's first and perhaps only opportunity for communication as equals, Petry ironically points up the effects of Fordist economic organization in terms of race and sexuality. Inside the car, or along a mechanized assembly line, people are interchangeable. But once you try to set up house, codes of race and sexuality reassert themselves. Thus, Petry calls attention to the racial and gendered power relations imbedded in home-making, imbalances which make heterosexuality about ownership in the Treadway mansion and the hotel in New York. Bedrooms are key sights for the downfall of Nick Romano as well. Nick, the novel's pretty boy gangster protagonist, refuses his family's attempts to make his life into an alter-boy becomes respectable husband narrative. Nick's aversion to the normative heterosexual bedroom is forecast early in the novel, in a scene of homosocial sexual discovery. As the group of boys with curious and excited eyes sneak into an alleyway to peer into the bedroom window of Old man Snyder and his wife, Nick didn't look. He stood huddled into a tight knot. He only looked at the shadows against the shade  big, convulsive, distorted. 16 Motley portrays the marriage bed as a space of surveillance and fear. Nick's refusal to watch the couple having sex, his running away from the window, reveals his breaking with the norms of his friends. Nick does not aspire to be married, symbolically protesting the normative domesticity of his parents plans for him, much as Link refuses the terms of masculinity that Abbie's house represents. Instead of joining in the growing white ethnic upper-working class domestication (funded by government programs that enabled working class families to buy houses in the suburbs), Nick joins a multiracial, homoerotic gang on West Madison. The streets provide Nick with a version of family not bound to a particular house, but instead a bonding between a homosocial/homoerotic male network whose bonds house and feed Nick in a myriad of locations  flophouses, the Nickel Plate, Pastime. Their outlaw mentality binds Nick to his friends on the street, alongside mutual obligations (monetary and emotional). They share a life of secrets and hiding from the surveillance of the law and their families. Nick explains, when he was with the fellows he forgot all about home; he was happy . . . The street pulled you back. It got in your blood. 17 In the novel's schematic separation of home life (images of walls, enclosure, isolation, enforced heterosexual masculinity and femininity, poverty and hunger) and street life (danger, movement, homoerotic male bonding), we can see a direct parallel with the perverse interracial sexual relationship in The Narrows  one that can never lead to marriage or home, but instead allows for escape. Discourses of home for African Americans in the 40s and 50s were heavily weighted with the weight of racial salvation through heteropatriarchal assimilation into national norms. Ferguson explains, As African American gender and sexual practices were made into social phenomena, it then followed that those practices could be reformed through state intervention. 18 Like Nick at the bedroom window, Motley is turned off by the idea of fixing up the heterosexual unit as a way to reform the entire race. Knock on Any Door focuses on the way that doing just that, knocking on any door of the urban poor, is a dead end in terms of trying to understand Nick, whose most vital relationships take place on the streets. This makes Nick's story even more appealing, as it cannot be captured in the mass produced normality of domestic heterosexuality. Nick's marriage leads not only to his wife's death (Emma kills herself lying in their marriage bed), but also to Nick's confession for murdering Riley as his guilt about Emma breaks his emotional resolve to hide the truth from the jury. Motley's portrait of Emma and Nick's wedding predicts the homoerotic attachment to movement and fear of heterosexual enclosure that will undoes both characters. In the wedding ceremony itself, streetcars going by repeatedly interrupt Nick's intent focus on the wedding ring in his pocket, Behind the heavy drapes a streetcar clanged by on 12th Street and Nick was so scared that he wished he was on it. 19 Emma and Nick's house, and in particular their bed, resembles death more than new life. Nick can treat Emma well until the heterosexual script takes over, He was nice to her as he could be all evening. But that night in bed he failed her again. 20 Motley traces these failures directly back to Nick's life on the street, as he confesses to Emma that I can't be a real husband to you. . . . (because) I was no good from the time I was sixteen. There were men and women. A lot of them. 21 Motley highlights how the husband is a character that disallows a sexual past with other men and women, the space of home within this model does not accommodate any sexual/gender/racial ambiguity. Like the river in Petry's contrast of natural beauty to modern disruption, the space of the woods gives Motley an alternative, natural space to contrast to both the domestic home and the public streets. The woods release Nick's wife, Emma, from the gender and sexually regulative space of her home. The woods provide a symbolic contrast in the novel for the death and foreclosure of possibilities represented in marital homes. In the woods, Emma and Leo pulled off all their clothes. With their bodies naked, with their belly buttons like the belly buttons on gingerbread men they went into the water. With the sun on your body, with the warm wind tickling your back and your small, narrow hips it was nice. But you didn't tell Mommy about it (224). Motley's use of free indirect discourse in this passage (a fitting contrast to the omniscient narrative perspective employed in the scenes of Nick's trial), makes the woods into a space of cross-gender play for not only Emma and Leo, but for readers as well. Throughout Emma's section, Motley connects readers to Emma's story by foregrounding the literariness of her life  books provide her scripts for heterosexuality. Motley uses this readerly identification to bring us closer to the experience of Emma's tragic transition from tomboy to heterosexual woman. Like the space of the street and bars in Nick's developing masculinity, the woods give Emma a sexual and gender freedom that allows her to live out perversions such as incest, even if only imaginatively. The woods is also where Emma and Nick spend their first, chaste night together, where Nick follows Emma deep into the woods.22 The woods were like home to Emma, providing a space where she can tell Nick her experiences of the broken urban home and her mother's drinking. The smell of beer that pervades their kitchen is a remnant of failed American dreams played out in the failure of the heterosexual family, even before the family fails the house fails: Inside their house the coldness smacked through worse than outdoors. Outdoors you were running and playing. In the house to keep warm you had to go to bed or sit with your chair almost on top of the stove. 23 Motley shows how the urban poor are not suffering from lacking morals as much as lacking funds to support stable sexual relationships. As the 1950s standard for masculinity became more linked with consumerism and financing a domestic unit, the poor were virtually disallowed from the normative terms of heterosexuality.24 The marriage bed is literally a space of death for women like Emma and her mother, who standards of gender and class tell them not to work but they also can't afford to be supported by their husbands. Like Willard Motley in Knock on Any Door, Petry's critique of heteropatriarchy highlights the space of the domestic home as a space of death. Abbie's standards of decorum within her home kill not only her connection to Dumble Street and any gender or sexual ambiguity that represents, but also indirectly kill her husband (The Major). In The Narrows, the editor of the local paper, Peter Bullock, is enslaved to his wife's capitalist-domestic ideology. Motley does not take us behind the scenes of the newspaper reports on Nick's trial, but the press men bet on Nick's trial and punishment. Like Bullock, their wealth is intimately tied to the destruction of the protagonist.25 In Romance and Rights: The Politics of Interracial Intimacy, 1945-1954, Alex Lubin explores America's post-war denial of the possibilities for African-Americans to control a private sphere. Rachel Peterson has recently expanded on this point, highlighting Petry's critique of the media as a falsified public sphere that served merely to create another privacy shield for whites who controlled its coverage of their crimes.26 Bullock's paper acts as just such a shield. Furthermore, his decision to publish stories that villify Link in the end comes from his need to pay the mortgage on the modern house that is a parody of Hearth and Home, where he burns specially treated wood for Decorative effect. 27 Not only is his domesticity depleting his life of home and warmth, but it also sets Link's murder into motion in order to serve these same empty domestic ideals. Through Bullock, Petry links these processes of domestic consumption to the commodification of the public sphere. The Treadway Butler, Malcolm Powther, also gets caught up in simulating home, only he makes a home-scene for his employers, Bunny and Camilo Treadway. Powther thinks that his attempts to stage the Treadway marriage as domestic bliss will save him from association with Link and the rest of Dumble Street. Powther sees himself as the savior of not only the aesthetics of the Treadway house, but the Treadway marriage and dynasty in the union of Bunny and Camilo. Powther reminded himself, as he always did whenever he felt a little low in his mind, that though he was constantly defeated at home, he was a conqueror, a victor at Treadway Hall, and this victory makes up for his wife infidelity by linking him to the equally cuckolded Bunny. Both Powther and Bunny are emasculated because they cannot own their wives, whose sexual excesses or perversions unravel any attempts to keep them at home. No amount of aesthetic work by Powther can introduce real feeling into the Treadway marraige, or his own. In a technique reminiscent of Motley's portrait of a wedding, Petry forcasts the failures of Camilo and Bunny Treadway's union through a picture taken by Jubine, the novel's communist photographer. Jubine's aesthetic is about the street, he gets the best photos because of an uncanny ability to be out in the way when things are happening  not at home, or working to finance a home. Peter Bullock tries to explain the power of Jubine's photography to his wife, He took the honey to Vogue, all light and shadow, the Treadway girl and that man she married, whoever he was, perfect down to the last cufflink . . . . But he brought me the shot with the peons crowding into the picture, one with no legs practically sitting in the bride's dress, squatting in the folds of the wedding gown. 28 Jubine's photographs highlight the connections between the disabled man (Cat Jimmie) and the Treadway fortune that pays for such a perfect down to the last cufflink wedding, as Bullock explains that Cat Jimmie is a WWI veteran. Throughout the novel, Cat Jimmie has rolled along Dumble street, trying to look up women's skirts. His injury leaves him no other sexual pleasure, distorting his intense masculine sexuality into a kind of predatory voyeurism. Jubine's photo of Cat Jimmie, squatting in the folds of the wedding gown, does more than connect his disability to the Treadway fortune. The image reveals the emptying out of sexual desire from the jewels and finery of the wedding gown's whiteness. It is also significant that Cat Jimmie literally chases Camilo into Link's arms, showing how the presence of nonnormative sexuality and even violence cannot be erased by the wedding's finery. In the figure of Cat Jimmie, Petry critiques the perversion of desire caused by war and capitalism, and links this to both the perverse and domestic desires of the relationship between Link and Camilo. Number Six Dumble street, despite Abbie's meticulous care, is also eventually undone by perversity. Abbie aims to give Link a more normative, white life, symbolized by buying him a house on the other side of town: She had picked out a house for him, a brick house, on the other side of town. The instant she saw the For Sale sign on it, she'd managed to marry Link to a nice girl, and get them moved into the house, all in her mind. 29 Petry calls attention to the way the house is For Sale, highlighting the classy and abstract quality of Abbie's hopes for Link's domesticity. In a similar way, Link's body and desires are irrelevant to the story Abbie wants to script him into. At this point in the novel, Abbie still believes that the equally mass-produced brick house and nice girl can capture all of Link's desires. The violence of Abbie's reaction to discovering Link and Camilo in bed is worth quoting extensively because it highlights the meanings she has invested in both her home and her bedroom: Someone was laughing, outside, on the street. Dumble Street. She slammed the front door, banging it shut. Where am I? She went back into her room, closed the door, still wanting to shout at the girl, even though she was gone, How dare you, dare you, in my house, tramp, in my house, yellow hair on my pillowcases, the bridal ones, the ones that I made with my own hands, as part of my trousseau, with lace edges, filet lace, that I crocheted, smiling, dreaming about my wedding day. 30 It is hard to tell whether Abbie is more outraged at Link and Camilo's transgressive affair, or by the fact that they have had sex in her house, on her bridal bed sheets. Abbie's attempts to insulate her house (and her marriage) from Dumble Street and the sexual perversion the street signals have failed in Link's choice of a partner, so much so that she does not even recognize her surroundings any more. Abbie wonders Where am I? 31 She can bang the door shut, but the laughter and excesses (sexual, alcoholic, and even musical) of Dumble Street have already defiled the sanctity of her lace pillow cases. In the above passage, Petry combines short, powerful sentence fragments within Abbie's memories of the Major and Bill Hod's voice to give the reader the sense that time is moving incredibly slowly yet Abbie's emotions and memories are rushing upon her to rapidly to capture in full sentences. Abbie's thoughts emphasize the breakdown of rationality in the face of all she has attempted to keep separate  the sexuality of the street and of Bill Hod and her memories of her marriage and her own heterosexuality. Abbie also remembers her husband's dying words The house..., and feels Link's bringing the harlot into the house is a violation of the Captain's memory. Abbie seems powerless is the face of overwhelming misunderstandings about men, and further debilitated by her attempts to make all men into one voice. This passage also highlights how much mental work and emotionally energy Abbie has expended making meanings of safety and respectability out of items of housekeeping like sheets and pillowcases. The repeated phrases of my house and I made point up Abbie's physical and psychic labor in imagining her domestic space. Abbie's associations with her house are first broken by Mamie Powther's entrance. The character of Mamie Powther personifies the sexuality that exceeds the space of both the home and the street, private and public spheres. Kimberly Drake, in her exploration of Mamie as a Blues Woman, forcefully argues that Mamie's sexual agency creates a space of life and change within Abbie's home. Drake points to Petry's contrasting the Treadway mansion as a model of domestic perfection but lacking in life of any kind, and Mamie's kitchen which makes the house (into) a haven of delicious food and playful affection. 32 Drake concludes that Mamie transcends the home/street (place/placeless) duality altogether by constructing her identity around her own sensual and emotional pleasure and moving freely between home and street. 33 Petry's narrative also moves freely amongst public and private spaces that her characters intend to keep separate, as the violence and loneliness of consumerist domesticity undoes the boundaries between class and racial groups. While Mamie's entrace signals a new incursion of Dumble Street into Number Six, the work Abbie has done previously shows the precariousness of the houses' division from the neighborhood. Petry also shows how Mamie also draws out the sexual desires of all the novel's characters, including Abbie's desires the have remained hidden underneath gloves and similar trappings of respectability. Abbie's observations of Mamie washing her clothing in the yard betray this possibility of queer desire, There was an almost hypnotic rhythm about her movements, Abbie found that she, too, couldn't look away. . . Wind whipped the clothes back and forth, lifting the hem of Mamie Powther's short cotton dress as though it peered underneath and liked what it saw and so returned again and again for another look. . . . I don't believe she's got a thing on under that dress. 34 As Abbie becomes mesmerized by Mamie Powther's movements and near nakedness, Petry shows how Mamie exceeds her domestic space while also exceeding the bounds of heterosexuality.35 The word too in this passage points out the almost universal invitation of Mamie's sexuality, even the wind itself is attracted to her. Petry sets this scene in the context of laundering clothes, using the contrast between Abbie and Mamie's housekeeping practices (she is trying to get Link away from the door and thus away from the wiles of Mamie's washing dance) to highlight connections between aesthetics of home-making and sexuality. Abbie's homemaking is all about policing the sexual boundaries of the house, represented later in the novel by her reflections that she was trying to find Link a good girl, (one of) the ones who went to church, the ones who wanted husbands and homes and children. 36 Mamie Powther's short cotton dress is another aesthetic choice that values pleasure and comfort over concealment of desires within the confines of narratives about ownership that make husbands, homes and children into useful items for the practice of signifying respectability. Unlike Powther, who sees Mamie as a conquest that he can never fully own and thus desires all the more, Mamie is unconcerned with ownership and normative relations to her home, husband or children. Like Emma in the woods, Mamie is representing something natural and productive in this scene, set against Abbie's attempts to limit sexuality within her home. While Mamie can be thought of as a similar symbolic device to Emma in Knock on Any Door, she also shares with Nick (and with Link) an inability to pretend to be anything other than what she is. This comes out most clearly in her choice of bedroom furniture, which Abbie judges as appalling, vulgar, and out of place in Number Six Dumble Street. 37 Mamie's pink bed, with cupids and grapes adorning the headboard, symbolically stand against both Abbie's hand sewn lace bridal sheets and also Camilo's transplanted Treadway bed in the illicit couple's hotel room. Mamie's sexuality symbolizes comfort, self-affirmation, and openness to shifting power relations between (and amongst) men and women. Just as Weak Knees, the chef at The Last Chance, argues that in Russia nobody would get up in arms about Paul Robeson marrying a white woman, Mamie enacts a sexuality that doesn't respect marriage or perversion as narratives. Her bedroom fits this aesthetic of pleasure. Through Mamie's deliberate aesthetic choices and her almost universal sexual attractiveness, Petry critiques the idea that reformers should (or could) uncover the vice hidden in certain racialized neighb"
ENG.G2.04.1,Augusta Webster Paper,English,Argumentative Essay,"Augusta Webster, a poet perhaps best known for writing dramatic monologues that take on a woman's voice, appears to enter less familiar territory when she decides to depict A Painter (1866). The poem presents itself as the musings-out-loud of a struggling male artist whose family and financial straits require him to spend an undue amount of time producing what he calls hackwork (17). Webster's painter, it seems, spends as much energy creating trifles to sell as he does lamenting the evils of a society that would force him to prostitute his talent in such a manner. The only light that manages to seep its way into the painter's ailing psyche emanates from his wife, Ruth, a woman whose degree of love and devotion manages to keep the speaker to the level of [his] hopes (23). Where exactly those hopes level off, however, is an issue that the poem takes up relentlessly. Angela Leighton claims that the speaker of A Painter comes across as a sympathetic realist, a man who could've succeeded but for the financial constraints that society imposes upon him: Webster turns the focus outwards, and looks to the material obstacles in her truly 'unknown' painter's life. She thus gives a vivid and moving description of the lesser art he practices and the real hardships he has to bear (183). Leighton specifically identifies these obstacles as evidence of the economic pressure at work in a post-industrial, post-Marxist England, a world in which the economic substructure of the market dictates the artist's consciousness itself (184). While these observations are doubtless valid, Leighton spends little time discussing how the painter's evocation of Rutha figure very much present in the poem, despite her vocal absencebears upon the larger social critique that they suggest. Leighton specifically argues that the painter is not an arch-Romantic, driven by high ideals&but a humbler sort, whose domestic responsibilities weigh heavily on him (184). Again, this statement is ostensibly true: the painter doubts his work will ever be known. He certainly does not expect to become rich by his art. However, at the moments in which he explicitly discusses his wife, Webster's painter is, in fact, exceedingly romantic: he claims Ruth as his inspiration, his rock, the happy prophet who radiates bliss simply because she knows she is Home (21). As the painter sinks deeper into his own melancholy, his description of Ruth becomes all the more idealized. Despite these apparently humble professions of a devoted husband, though, a closer look at the painter's rhetoric reveals that the romanticization of Ruth enables him to use her as a device by which he might evoke the compassion of his auditor and Webster's reader. Ruth and the children she shares with the speaker provide him with a sympathetic outlet: we are able to imagine the painter working earnestly to protect the domestic tableau he creates by so ardently invoking them. But, if the painter claims Ruth as his muse, it is only so that he can further blame her (and the marriage she represents) for his artistic downfall. The speaker's romanticism, the humbleness of which Leighton writes, begins to fall away once we realize that the painter shoves the responsibility for his failure onto the woman he purports to adore. Thus, while he certainly gestures toward societal and economic constraints as reasons for his own floundering career, the painter makes a direct connection between those constraints and the silent wife he intermittently glorifies. The painter's conflict resides within his mind, inside his own personal decision to marry, as much as it does within the economic and social forces that remain beyond his control. By touting Ruth's spirit and thereby positioning himself as a reverential husband, the painter is able to partially diffuse or to deny outright the underlying implication that he'd rather not be a husband at all. His regret at having married Ruth, and the lion's share of blame he places on her for the failure of his artistic career, always rest comfortably below the surface; he never elucidates his accusation and, in any case, the conventions of the dramatic monologue do not allow Ruth a response. We can therefore only truly read Ruth as a redemptive, gratified wife if we agree to take the painter's statements on his own questionable terms. Webster's poem ultimately offers a comment on the validity of its speaker's societal critique by ironizing the painter's transparent idealism of Ruth. If the painter is sympathetic, as Leighton claims, he arouses sympathy at the expense of his wife's voice; the economic inequality he overtly impugns becomes a mere backdrop in front of which he can more safely claim Ruth as the primary detriment to his professional life. Ruth seemingly constitutes the painter's reason for existence; he says she is his one believer, an angelic presence without whom he could not paint a sunbeam (21-22). The poem thus on one level encourages us to commiserate with a poor couple that an elitist society has wronged. However, this unqualified admiration for Ruth quickly morphs into a meditation over the effect she has on her husband's artistic career: A sunless way without her, yet perhaps It is a true sad word. I might have been Without her what she'd have me be. No, no A handier painter possibly, more apt& A more successful man, but not the man My earnest Ruth believes in. Darling, you Who, under all your pretty fitful ways, Your coaxings and your poutings, have the strength Of the noblest kind of women, helping strength For any man with worth enough to use it You keep me to the level of my hopes& It was a good day for me when you came Into my fretted life, and I thank God It was no evil one for you (22-23). The speaker appears to put his wife before himself, to believe that the most important role for him to play is the man his earnest Ruth believes in. While this passage demonstrates the painter's apparent admiration for his wife, though, it also exhibits his tendency to put words into her mouth. The confident assertion that it was a good day for Ruth when she married a man who presents himself as a dispirited pauper begs to be questioned: if Ruth could respond to such a comment, do we believe she would agree? Without her assent, we can certainly never be sure. The claims that Ruth would have [him] be a successful bachelor who'd never made the mistake of marrying seems wishful thinking at best. Even if the painter's accolades are sincere, they still point to his belief that the noblest kind of woman is one who acts merely as a ballast for her husband's sense of self-worth. Luckily for the painter, the monologue structure forbids Ruth from contradicting him; her principal action consists of running in and out of the painter's working space as she attempts to tend to both him and to the children. The speaker's romantic idealization of his wife thus relies fundamentally upon a concurrent refusal to engage her. Further, the univocal structure of the dramatic monologue provides the painter with ample room in which to misread his wife's intentions. In a misinterpretation of what could just as easily be defiant moodiness, he takes Ruth's coaxings and poutings, to be manifestations of her loyalty. It is up to the reader, then, to discern a disjunction between pouting and the contentedness that the painter imagines that he apprehends. In addition, the insistent assertions that you are happier even in our want and you are happy, love, because you know/You are my happiness draw attention to the painter's reluctance to ask Ruth a question whose answer might well prove negative: Are you happy? The painter's inkling that he could've been a more successful man had his attachment to Ruth not hindered him never wanes: he repeatedly presents a direct chain of causality between his marriage and his lackluster career. In four lines that constitute little less than a direct thesis statement, he explicitly claims that A man with wife and children, and no more To give them than his hackwork brings him in, Must be a hack and let his masterpiece Go to the devil (18). His argument thus follows that 1) If one hadn't married, one would have more money; 2) If one had more money, one could study more and cultivate the beau monde; 3) If one could afford to study more, one would doubtless produce a masterpiece that would make one famous; and 4) One's marriage thus prevents one from an otherwise inevitable celebrity. That the painter constructs his remark in vaguer terms (that is, A man, rather than myself) serves several functions. First, it affords his contentionthat a poor artist's marriage precludes his successful professional lifea universal resonance; it is not only this man, but all married men who must exchange a masterpiece for a wife and children. Second, though, the very act of ventriloquizing such a universal truth positions the painter as a man with a considerable degree of self-confidence. Webster's speaker feels he knows enough about the way of the world to generalize about it, and his lack of success allows him to speak from a point-of-view that seems less arrogant for its own deficiency. Finally, the painter's apparently unshakable belief that he would create a masterpiece (were it not for the hackwork that his family's subsistence demands) affects a noticeable counterpoint to the humility his that monologue attempts to evoke. Later on, the painter's vocal enactment of the precise criticisms that the May-fair crowds will doubtless make of his workhere's a harebrained fellow comes to us/ I am a painter Ino need to study(19) presents a similar display of hubris. Rather than waiting to see what becomes of his work, he quickly predicts public sentiment. It is hardly surprising, then, that the painter's version of public discourse conveniently suits his case; to take his assumptions on faith (as the speaker asks us to) would be to implicitly agree with him that his marriage and the penury it caused impeded his need to study. The act of beckoning toward Raphael and Michael Angelo and such to be his true judges, therefore, both saves the painter from reproof (the masters are, after all, in no condition to talk back) and situates him amongst art's undisputed virtuosi. That the painter should be sure his critics would bid him wait bears significantly upon the weight of his argument. The word wait constitutes a mantra for the conjured critics, appearing as it does eleven times within only twenty-one lines. (See, for example, And then another says Yes he should wait,/And another Wait, and Wait, and once more Wait. (19)). The meaning of this repeated imperative seems clear enough: the painter must wait through the arduous study of an apprenticeship to hone his talent rather than sell his pictures outright. However, the injunction to wait takes on a different shade of meaning once Ruth's entrance threatens to interrupt the speaker's poignant soliloquy. As a physical presence in the room, Ruth embodies that for which the painter was required to quit his waiting altogether. While the poem locates Ruth as a woman whose poverty forces her to wait ceaselessly upon her husband and children (her servile waiting leaves her little time, for example, to sit down and wait for the painter to stop talking), it also suggests that she (or more properly, the marriage that she represents) hinders the painter from waiting to study before he sells his work. Whatever grand social commentary that Leighton sees unfolding in Webster's poem begins to blur as the speaker's complaint takes on an increasingly personal, self-centered register. The waiting of which the painter speaks when he mutters that our young men will not wait is thus entirely up for grabs. The critics' prescribed waiting refers just as much to marriage and childbearing as it does to artistic discipline: the speaker indeed insinuates that both activities have become inextricably and fatally intertwined. The relation of repeated words to key themes in the poem that the wait example indicates holds true also with the word name. The painter equates having a name (such as Michael Angelo or Rafael) with being a successful artist at the same time that he laments his own unfamiliar name: Ah Ruth! If I could only win a name! / And then, love, then! (18; 21). The previous statement is typically ambiguous; it most obviously implies a causal relationship, an if/then scenario between the painter's acquisition of a name and his professional achievement. Judging by the relation that the speaker drew earlier between his family and his ability to wait, however, the lines might easily be read If I could only win a name; then love. Then. An additional implication would thus follow that love (i.e. a married relationship with a woman) should come second, only after the painter achieves his proper naming. Such a compartmentalization threatens to leave Ruth in the lurch, considering that her husband's monologue necessarily prevents her from replying to an imagined success in which she and her children remain secondary concerns. At the very least, the painter's admission that art comes before marriage problematizes the earlier, romantic language through which he placed Ruth on a figurative pedestal. It is up to the poem itselfthat part of it which is able to stand back and cast an ironizing eye on the painter at the same time that it delivers his oratoryto gesture toward Ruth's agency. Given a text in which a name so pointedly confers power upon its possessor, Webster's decision to provide Ruth (and her daughter Blanche) with names suggests that the women in the poem possess the very endowment that the painter so insistently admits that he lacks. Within the same hierarchy of naming that he delineates in order to plead a case against his wife, the painter can't help revealing that Ruth and Blanche actually stand above him. Even the title of the poemA Painterallows the speaker nothing more than an indefinite article upon which to pin his identity; the defining element of his status as an artist is the vagueness that Webster ascribes to it, the humiliating designation of the speaker as he who is publicly unknown. All of the anti-Romantic social illumination that Leighton locates in Webster's poem depends upon the silencing of a woman who might well speak had her husband's monologue afforded her the time or the opportunity to do so. Rather than risk depicting Ruth on her own terms, the speaker instead paints her in colors that suit his own psychic process. The responsibility of marriage, and the economic systems (post-industrialist, post-Marxist or otherwise) that force married men to provide for their families before themselves become easy scapegoats by which Webster's painter is able to evade personal responsibility for his own failure. That the speaker cloaks this silencing in romantic rhetoric does not erase its occurrence; rather it makes the description of Ruth as a humble servant all the more untenable. By positioning his wife as a silent object of worship, the painter links her closely to the patterned dabletsthose insipid female portraits the public calls poem-likethat he must turn out to earn his living. Small wonder that his most successful artistic efforts depict, doubtless with unwitting realism, a girl dying, crying, marrying (17).

ENG.G3.04.1,Creative Multivalence: Social Engagement in Gwendolyn Brooks's 'Maud Martha',English,Argumentative Essay,"In her essay Nuance and the Novella, one of the first (and few) substantive readings of Maud Martha, Barbara Christian considers the work as in-between, looking back toward the social protest novels of the 30s and 40s (such as Native Son), and prefiguring some of the themes and modes that were to develop in the novels by Black women writers in the 70s, and she offers a reading of how Brookss use of nuance, as Christian interprets it, allows her to achieve her political and literary goals. I find the question of nuance a troubled one, however: criticism on the novel is split between discussions of its understatement, fragmented nature, limited viewpoint and subject matter1, and arguments for reading these as symptoms of a suppressed rage.2 Interestingly, there are many passages in the novel which seem to suggest irony, ambivalence, or a sort of layering3 of innocent sincerity with valenced protest  in which Im not convinced were supposed to read Maud Marthas silence, restraint, or good nature simply as such in the first place, symptomatically or otherwise. Hortense Spillers is the only other critic so far to venture into exploring this ambiguity, and although she does not pursue it in-depth, nor provide many examples, she does remark that [t]he often sardonic quality of the writing and its persistently ironical force save the narrative from pathos (Spillers 234). At the same time, while reading Gwendolyn Brookss letters in the archives and marginalia in her first autobiography, I was struck by the multivalent, and/or dubiously reliable, nature of her statements about her own life and writing. To begin with, she has said, Maud Martha is a lovely little novel about a lovely little person, wrestling with the threads of her milieu. Of course this lovely little person was the essence of myself, or aspects of myself tied with as neat a ribbon as my innocence could manage. The novel is very funny, very often! -- and not at all disappointing [...] (Self-interview 114). In this fascinating characterization of her novel, Brooks actually echoes the language of its early reviewers, who gave it the kind of ladylike treatment that assured its dismissal, and invariably chose to describe the novel in words that reflected what they considered the novels appropriate feminine values (Washington 453). That the lovely little novel actually takes on racism, the color hierarchy, disillusionment with marriage, war, and lynching, and the inherent paradox of calling ones novel not at all disappointing add complexity to the statement, and give the reader to believe that Brookss words, in her novel as well as elsewhere, are perhaps not meant to be read straight, even when they are felt in earnest. In this essay, I will first explore this strategic multivalence as it appears in the novel, considering that of Brookss own commentary alongside it where possible. Then, in a sustained reading of the rat and mouse scenes, I will undertake a comparative analysis of the mechanisms of liberation and hero-formation that operate in Maud Martha alongside those of Native Son. Finally, I will argue that the sophisticated consciousness with which Brooks endows her protagonist, and the nimbly complex signification through which this consciousness is expressed, point to a new, non-naturalistic form of social engagement which Brooks innovates in Maud Martha. The first instance in which this layered sort of narrative struck me was in Maud Marthas thoughts, upon attempting to resist Pauls will to choose an unbearably cheap apartment for them: Was her attitude unco-operative? Should she be wanting to sacrifice more, for the sake of her man? A procession of pioneer women strode down her imagination; strong women, bold; praiseworthy, faithful, stout-minded; with a stout light beating in the eyes. Women who could stand low temperatures. Women who would toil eminently, to improve the lot of their men. Women who cooked. She thought of herself, dying for her man. It was a beautiful thought. (58-9) There are many different threads of meaning interwoven here. To begin with, the initial two questions do sound potentially sardonic, particularly since we have just been told a few lines prior that Maud Martha had resolved to hold out firmly against stove-heated flats. [...] And no basements. You got T.B. in basements (58). This context seems to suggest that these first two questions are aimed rather at the reader, in a challenging tone, and to discourage their reading as earnest questions directed inwardly  and yet, this latter reading is not altogether precluded. As the narrative rolls on, it is possible to imagine that Maud Martha becomes overwhelmed with the images of female self-sacrifice she has seen extolled, and begins to yield herself to them; and yet, this reading does not sit comfortably for at least two reasons. First, the word choice of pioneer women refers to a primarily white imperialism, a dedication to the expansion of a white patriarchy, among whose ranks Im not sure Maud Martha would readily count herself, as Valerie Frazier claims she does in that moment (136). Second, the first word that might really indicate Maud Marthas allegiance is beautiful: It was a beautiful thought (59). Especially given the novels investment in emphasizing the oppressive nature of contemporary beauty standards,4 this begs the question: beautiful to whom? The critical message underlying innocent interactions, minimalistically portrayed, becomes more pronounced in the young couple at home : they spend an evening out at a musicale, during the whole of which Paul acts much like a small child: he sleeps through the show and then annoys Maud Martha with clowning all the way home (66). The chapter shows us multiple examples of Pauls tiresomeness, his intellectual inaptitude next to Maud Martha, yet all of this goes without explicit comment, save for one clue: while Paul, having failed at his sexual advances, settles down to read a paperback titled Sex in the Married Life, Maud Martha reads W. Somerset Maughams Of Human Bondage. In context, the implication of the title itself is nearly unavoidable in Maud Marthas situation; Maughams grim portrayal of attempts at romantic love and the intellectual disparity between the couples choices of reading add further possible shades of meaning. If this reading of the chapter is correct, it is the first and most explicit statement the reader gets from Brooks regarding Maud Marthas awareness of her unsatisfactory marital situation. At the same time, it is an important turn, for fiction of its time, that here the suffering protagonist is not left alone or in ignorance, but is allowed the company of a novel that might help to develop her understanding of her circumstances. This understanding, as I will argue further on, will become the key to Maud Marthas survival, and the key to the new kind of novel Brooks was after. Meanwhile, Pauls lack of curiosity in the arts reappear in were the only colored people here, although this time he does agree to accompany Maud Martha to The World Playhouse, a movie theater downtown generally patronized by whites, and the couple both suffer their cool reception there. But during the magic of the film itself, Paul presse[s] her hand and says to Maud Martha that they should come back, and attend plays as well (77-78). In an ambiguously presented response, She pressed back, smiling beautifully to herself in the darkness. Though she knew that once the spell was over it would be a year, two years, more, before he would return to the World Playhouse. And he might never go to a real play. But she was learning to love moments. To love moments for themselves (78). Against the dark background of the chapter  the intellectual inequality between Maud Martha and Paul, the racism of their environment  its difficult to read these ameliorative last two lines completely in earnest. Although one could argue that this sentiment might match the way Brooks would come to regard marriage a quarter-century hence,5 the reader almost certainly doesnt share this generous view of Paul as a husband at this point in the novel, and Maud Marthas valiant efforts to be contented nevertheless strike one as somewhat pitiable. This effect does not necessarily entail any lack of sincerity on Maud Marthas part  that question is left open; regardless, it illustrate the fact that a scene may evoke pity, anger, sadness, etc. simply by showing the situation of a character, even (and perhaps especially) without the characters directly voicing this response for the reader. In this way, Brooks carves out a sense of protest that departs that of naturalism: both the lachrymal prose of earlier versions, such as that of Stephen Cranes Maggie, and the raw drama of Native Son. While depicting everyday hardships, and while employing understatement, Brooks can evoke an emotional response in the reader. In this model, Maud Marthas uncomplaining nature is a key factor, and therefore it must be preserved even while she serves as the vehicle of criticism. Accordingly, Maud Marthas extremely magnanimous responses to the questionable behavior of others is even more striking in a birth, which Brooks has said, is a fairly good mirror of the birth of my first child (Report From Part One 192). To a neighbor just arriving after little Paulette is born, Maud Martha says, exultantly, Did you hear the news? I just had a baby, and I feel strong enough to go out and shovel coal! Having a baby is nothing, Mrs. Barksdale. Nothing at all. Aw, yeah? Mrs. Barksdale smacked her gum admiringly. Well, from what I heard back there a while ago, didnt seem like it was nothing. Girl, I didnt know anybody could scream that loud. Maud Martha tittered. Oh, she felt fine. She wondered why Mrs. Barksdale hadnt come in while the screaming was going on; she had missed it all. People. Werent they sweet. She had never said more than Hello, Mrs. Barksdale and Hello, Mrs. Cray to these women before. But as soon as something happened to her, in they trooped. People were sweet. (98-99) In this passage, it seems that the innocent, sweet framing of Maud Marthas response allows her to communicate to the reader two less-than-rosy observations without seeming critical: that Mrs. Barksdale, who has just answered Maud Marthas triumphant account of her strength by contradicting it, did not try to help her during her labor, and that her neighbors sudden appearance might possibly have as much to do with nosiness as with altruism. But by conveying this information in the manner Brooks chose, she allows us to be annoyed at Mrs. Barksdale and to appreciate what might yet be an earnest sunniness in Maud Marthas character, without forcing one to contradict the other. Before leaving a birth, Id like to pause to consider a fascinatingly multivalent statement of Brookss own, regarding her desire to have children. Much of her reason for this, she says, was because I respected and marveled at and admired my body  I wanted my body to do everything its composition suggested it was supposed to do. I did not want my body to fail. I wanted my body, as well as my mind and spirit, to succeed, to reach an appropriate glory (204). In the midst of such positive and intrinsic valuation of her body, Brooks middle line, I did not want my body to fail, is quite unexpected. How not to have children would be to fail is not altogether clear  nor is it clear precisely whom it would fail, or according to what standard. If Brooks marvels at her body (as it is) and simultaneously anxious that it might fail at some sort of test, I am unable to trace exactly where and how that shift occurs  or how the two sentiments play out simultaneously. Nonetheless, it seems that competing views and feelings can coexist in the same moment, that individual physical vitality and social anxiety can be experienced at once, in this perspective that provided the model for a birth in Maud Martha. One of the most-discussed chapters in the novel is Maud Martha spares the mouse , which has been cast as a direct response to Biggers battle with the rat at the opening of Native Son.6 This essay will join in that discussion  but first, Id like to visit brotherly love : the chicken scene that, some eighty pages later, doubles and then departs from the compassion of the mouse scene. In doing so I hope to prime my reader for the ambivalence that the this scene casts back onto the earlier one. In brotherly love , Maud Martha is having to clean a chicken for dinner, and is thoroughly disgusted by her task. After a stomach-turning description of the ordeal, Maud Martha begins to reflect in wonder that people are capable of performing this grizzly disembowelment of the corpse of a chicken (152): But if the chicken were a man!  cold man with no head or feet and with all the little feath  er, hairs to be pulled out, and the intestines loosened and beginning to ooze out, and the gizzard yet to be grabbed and the stench beginning to rise! And yet the chicken was a sort of person, a respectable individual, with its own kind of dignity. The difference was in the knowing. What was unreal to you, you could deal with violently. If chickens were ever to be safe, people would have to live with them, and know them [...]. (153) As Frazier points out, Maud Martha anthropomorphizes the chicken much as she had the mouse (139), and, particularly in her ruminations about the antithesis between violence and awareness of anothers reality, for the chicken [w]e can substitute the disenfranchised woman (or even minority group), thus establishing that only when men can empathize with the plight of women will they discontinue the destruction of womens existential selves as perpetuated through the domestication of females (139). Indeed, although this reading might also be possible, I believe the passage in context suggests African Americans in the 1950s as the primary subject of the metaphor  especially when one considers Native Son. In any case, Brooks reinforces the compassionate piece of this chapter in her later comments on it in Report from Part One Marginalia: brotherly love is based on my old feelings regarding dressing a chicken, and on my continuing feelings that chickens are people, as are dogs, cats, rats, ants, birds, snakes, roaches, bears, fish, trees, weeds, flowers. People, that is, in the sense that we conceive people to be: things of identity and response (193). These sentiments are certainly noble and in concurrence with those of the earlier mouse scene. Then what can we make of what immediately follows the passage quoted above? The very next sentence reads, [w]hen the animal was ready for the oven Maud Martha smacked her lips at the thought of her meal (153). Suddenly, the person so sensitively considered had reverted to the animal, and the sort of knowing just advocated seems to have gone out the window. While the meaning of this is not clear, any number of interpretations suggest themselves: that this line is meant humorously; that its meant to humanize Maud Martha; that its a celebration of vitality; or that its a representation of the appetite for (or, at least, habit of) enjoying the fruits of predation against which the compassionate must struggle. Perhaps, in addition, it is an instance of contradiction for its own sake; as Spillers suggests of the novel more generally, the voice of the interior monologue mobilizes a plenitude of terms that evoke the fundamental ambivalence at the core of consciousness itself (245). Particularly since Brookss own commentary on this chapter seems to leave the last line out of consideration, this may well be an example of a split or dual perspective. Then again, perhaps Brooks simply meant to show that Maud Martha is not bound even by her own goodness. If Maud Martha is clearly aware of ugliness and oppression, but she chooses to defy with grace, to live as best she can (Lattin and Lattin 140), perhaps this last line tells us that she, as well as Brooks, are going to carry on regardless. What we have established by now, at the very least, is that Brooks has widely demonstrated a tendency to insinuate multiple meanings at once, and it is with this point in mind that I would like to reconsider Maud Martha spares the mouse as a response to the rat scene in Native Son. In her short note on the subject, Malin Lavon Walther interprets Brookss chapter as a positive rendering of domesticity [that] contrasts starkly with that of Wright (144). Moreover, Walther concludes, Departing from Wrights naturalistic cycle of destruction, Brooks affirms a nurturing and life-centered world view in this chapter and specifically associates it with creativity, broadly defined. Letting the mouse go is presented as a greater aesthetic and ethical act than killing it. [...] through the character of Maud Martha, Brooks negotiates hegemonic aesthetic standards of physical and literary or artistic beauty and creates an alternative aesthetic space in the domestic. (144). I would like to expand this valuable reading to engage more explicitly the way Brooks implicates the responsibility of the author to her or his protagonist as parallel to that of the protagonist to her or his surroundings. To develop the latter element in this equation, that of the manner in which the protagonist engages the world, we must return to an earlier metaphor: that of the rat or mouse to the African American subject white racism, as discussed above. Bernard Bell concurs and adds that the deadly confrontation is a metaphor for Biggers relationship to white society in much the same manner that Wrights vision of the Afro-American is a metaphor for American and modern man (157). Furthermore, for the rat and Bigger, fear evokes increasing aggression, and only murderous violence overcomes the fear (Bell 157). While the adrenaline-intensive account of the battle does not include much portrayal of Biggers thoughts or feelings, we are told, The rats belly pulsed with fear. Bigger advanced a step and the rat emitted a long thin song of defiance, its black beady eyes glittering, its tiny forefeet pawing the air restlessly (6). The mutual fear and aggression of which Bell speaks certainly do pervade Wrights account. Yet, in a version no less suggestive of social parallels, Brooks tells us of the mouse, Its bright black eyes contained no appeal  the little creature seemed to understand that there was no hope of mercy from the eternal enemy, no hope of reprieve or postponement  but a fine small dignity (69-70). Finally, in considering the mouses perspective, imagining the mouses family, and empathizing with it, Maud Martha could not bear the little look (70). Although Brooks undeniably does make the animal more appealing by casting it as a mouse instead of an aggressive rat over a foot long (indeed, Brooks hints at this just a few pages earlier, when Maud Martha thinks, in her aversion to roaches, She had rather see a rat  well, she had rather see a mouse (63)), she does not necessarily moderate the portrayal of its basic opposition to the eternal enemy. What she does do is allow it to seem to understand its situation, thereby preserving its fine small dignity, just as she proposes that Maud Marthas understanding of it might open up the option of responding with compassion instead of violence. In the case of both options, however, the protagonists responses to the intruder in their apartments bring them a measure of satisfaction, self-definition, and creation (or its prefiguring, in Biggers case). Biggers first smile in the novel appears when he sees that he has killed the rat (6), and suggests Wrights account of creation, when Bigger is eating breakfast with his family just after having accidentally killed, and then beheaded and incinerated, Mary Dalton: The thought of what he had done, the awful horror of it, the daring associated with such actions, formed for him for the first time in his fear-ridden life a barrier of protection between him and a world he feared. He had murdered and had created a new life for himself (Wright 105). If Bigger create[s] a new life for himself by doing something even more fearsome than the world he fears, Maud Martha does accomplishes the same (self-)creation through defying, counteracting, the fearsomeness of the world, defining herself as an exception to, rather than an excess of, that fearsomeness: Suddenly, she was conscious of a new cleanness in her. A wide air walked in her. A life had blundered its way into her power and it had been hers to preserve or destroy. She had not destroyed. In the center of that simple restraint was  creation. She had created a piece of life. It was wonderful (70-1). Maud Martha feels a giddy new sense of responsibility for  even credit for  the life of the mouse, just as Biggers elation (107) comes largely from his rapidly decreasing sense of responsibility for, or ties to, the lives around him. Moreover, this new sense of life is reinforced in both protagonists by their own conscious affirmation of their act and its implications for their respective self-definitions. For Maud Martha, the climax of the scene is her realization: Why, she thought, as her height doubled, why, Im good! I am good. She ironed her aprons. Her back was straight. Her eyes were mild, and soft with a godlike lovingkindness(Brooks 71). On the other hand, in a parallel passage, There was in [Bigger] a kind of terrified pride in feeling and thinking that some day he would be able to say publicly that he had done it (Wright 106). Whether becoming a powerful murderer or a good, godlike woman, both Bigger and Maud Martha feel transformed by their actions. In Brookss case, perhaps especially since her novel is roughly autobiographical, I think we can see her self-conscious implication of the creative role of the novelist in her discussion of the creation that her protagonist chooses. If, as Patricia and Vernon Lattin posit, Brooks suggests a positive way of life that can help one maintain ones self respect and creativity in the face of the racism and death which surround one. One can create in spite of the deadening realities of life (142, italics mine), I would argue that this exhortation might apply to the novelist herself as well as her protagonist and readership. Perhaps, for Brooks, the life that had blundered its way into her power had been that of her protagonist, hers to preserve or destroy (70-1); perhaps she sees her treatment of her protagonist as a moral and an artistic choice at the same time.7 As Maud Martha sees that she need not blindly succumb to circumstances but that she can in her own fashion create value and meaning (Lattin and Lattin 143), perhaps Brooks makes this argument for herself as a novelist at the same time, as resistance to the naturalistic cycle of destruction evinced in Native Son (Walther 144). At the time he wrote Native Son, Wright was heavily invested in a naturalism largely inspired by the Chicago School of sociology (Bell 151). After Biggers murder of Mary Dalton, he tells us, His crime seemed natural; he felt that all of this life had been leading to something like this (106). Bell observes that those [novels] influenced by the example of Native Son are informed by the belief that the character and history of man can be completely explained by biological and socioeconomic facts. The Wright paradigm of naturalism stresses the violence and pathological personalities that result from racial oppression and economic exploitation (167). Wrights goals in pursuing the types of characterizations he employs in Native Son may be said to involve alerting the white establishment to the chaos that certainly would ensue from the racism they were perpetuating; the inevitability of these dire consequences, in this view, helped to drive the need to emphasize sociological inevitability, rather than individual agency or exceptionalism, in his rendering of the novel. Yet, Bell points out, Wright sacrifices verisimilitude and the intellectual integrity of his protagonist in his effort to universalize the psychological and sociological message of the book (158). In order to conform to this message, and the naturalism the views people as animals in the natural world, responding to environmental forces and internal stresses and drives, none of which they can control or understand (Holman et al. 309), we are shown a protagonist who is controlled by social and psychological forces (Bell 157), and we understand more than Bigger does (Bell 158). The protagonists capacity for understanding, however, is the key to survival in the case of Maud Martha, and what gives her character its depth.8 The emphasis of the novel on Maud Marthas ruminations and imagination is important, as Spillers argues in this sterling passage, drawing from Maud Martha and New York : that the imagined and the real abrade unrelentingly here is intentional since we gauge Maud Marthas internal resources in even bolder relief against the brute facts. We could go so far as to say that the poets insistence on the narrative strategies of the piece and its rhetorical energies that plumb the interior world of the character spares Maud Martha the peculiar burdens of the naturalistic agent. In other words, if Maud Martha were read through eyes not the characters own, as would an omniscient narration, bent on imposing a content from the outside, already made to order, then we would not only lose Maud Marthas complexity, but might also conclude that victimage determines her. (241-2). It seems, then, that Maud Marthas understanding of her situation does a triple work: it offers her the option of distinguishing herself from, rather than being determined by, her circumstances; it frees her thereby from naturalism; and it thus allows us as readers to understand Maud Martha as a full individual9 distinct from her oppression. Moreover, Maud Marthas understanding, her ability to contemplate intellectually and empathetically the individuals and society around her, allow her some measure of mental freedom  or at least independence; some measure of self-determination despite it all. In stark contrast, a naturalistic precursor to understanding, consciousness, is precisely what threatens Bigger: The full consciousness of the shame and misery of the way they are forces to live threatens to engulf the protagonist in fear and despair. He knew that the moment he allowed what his life meant to enter fully into his consciousness, says the limited omniscient narrator, he would either kill himself or someone else (p. 14)10 (Bell 157). So where consciousness of ones circumstances incites fearful desperation, understanding of the same frees one from such a reaction, at least to some extent. For Brooks, it seems, understanding and mental fortitude are an essential part of what make empathy functional and effective: here I am reminded of the phrases educational sympathy and sane gentleness which Brooks penned in a thank-you card to her editor and friend, Dudley Randall, in 1974. These formulations of hers, particularly educational sympathy, seem to evoke a sympathy that uplifts through a combination of instruction, reflection, and emotional support  and that, fundamentally, understanding is what can set constructive emotional reactions in motion. D. H. Melhem, Brookss student and critic, maintains that the novel reveals an archetypal, postwar, bourgeois concern with home and family, and an aversion to politics (87). Although this characterization is helpful for understanding the literary milieu in which the novel was written, and although its reference to class does register as significant, Im not sure that the political engagement is avoided in Maud Martha as much as it is presented in intricately woven layers of meaning throughout the novel. Politics are not, in fact, absent even from the surface  multiple encounters with racist whites and Black people who discriminate against the darker-skinned appear throughout, and the reference to lynching (179) in the last chapter is nothing to be taken lightly. Nevertheless, Brooks focuses on Maud Marthas inner life, as this is an aspect of existence  and even of revolution  that she takes seriously: in her interview with Gloria T. Hull, she spoke of times when women are really rousing themselves and doing some fiery things, and even more than that, thinking fiery things (Update 101, italics mine). If the modern elevates the individual and the inward over the social and the outward (Holman et al. 298), Brooks did write primarily from the perspective of the former two, but was interested in the interplay between all of the above. Maud Martha is not at all disappointing, Brooks says in the 1984 self-interview referenced at the beginning of this essay, even though my heroine was never raped, did not become a lady of the evening, did not entire the world of welfare mothers ([...]), did not murder the woman who stepped on her toe in the bus (Self-interview 114, italics in original). Making tongue-in-cheek reference to contemporary expectations of representations of the Black Woman, Brooks defends the space she has carved for Maud Martha in her own right. Just as Maud Martha has developed her own standards, her own concept of the valuable (Christian 140), so does Brooks maintain the value of her novel, which enshrines, in an unheroic ordinary black girl from Chicago, a value that is almost always celebrated in the heroic, the extraordinary, the male (Christian 140): the power of self-definition and, thereby, world-definition. In doing so, Brooks avoids the sense of alienation, loss, and despair (Holman et al. 298) usually associated with the modernism in whose poetic style and emphasis on interiority her novel participates, instead choosing to defy with grace the many depressing elements around her (Lattin and Lattin 140), while nonetheless protesting them through her layered prose. Due to his sense of political urgency, Wright presumably felt that he could not afford to present his readership with a novel whose messages were ambiguous; yet, in her departure from naturalism and her emphatic investment in the significance of her protagonists self-understanding, Brooks found a way to make ambiguity work for her, even while registering various forms of social protest. Her dear friend, Haki Madhubuti, wrote for Brookss funeral, youve always been your own clock and as the seasons disappear and rise you know exactly what time it is, beating the beat in storms not of your own making. In the same way, the protagonist of her autobiographical novel defied her oppressive circumstances without finally allowing herself to be defined by them.

ENG.G0.06.1,My Life Is Not a Movie Starring Michelle Pfeiffer or Hilary Swank,English,Creative Writing,"� What am I supposed to do wit' chu? Perched behind her shoddy metal desk, the large Black woman eyed me up and down. Ignoring the thirty-eight pairs of eyes now glued on me, I contemplated turning around and running out of the classroom. Well  um  I'm actually a teaching intern with the Chicago Public Schools, and I'm just here to observe you, and then  well  teach the class, I responded, pretending that her question had been completely cordial and appropriate. And you're my mentor teacher, I thought. Awesome. Apparently satisfied with my explanation, Ms. Taylor pointed to a discolored yellow chair next to her desk and told me to have a seat. I sat down and tried to ignore the collective thought bubble that had materialized over the students: Who is this white girl, and what is she doing in our classroom? * * * This past September, when my friends asked me about the six weeks I had spent teaching summer school in the Chicago Public Schools (CPS), I knew that, in our academic, socially-aware culture, I was supposed to talk about what a wonderful, incredibly rewarding experience it had been. On that first day back in June, however, I encountered nothing wonderful nor rewarding to speak of. To put it bluntly, I had been scared shitless. Not scared of the students themselves, but scared that they wouldn't take me seriously. Scared that I wouldn't be able to get through to them. Scared that I would fail. After spending two semesters in the University of Michigan's School of Education, I had certainly been in front of a classroom of students before  but never like this. Never had I been faced with the task of teaching a class of thirty-eight students who ranged from grades nine through twelve  all of whom had failed English for one or both semesters of the previous school year. And never, never in all my middle-class suburban experience, had I been exposed to a group of students who lacked even the most miniscule amount of assumed respect for their teacher. Deep breaths, I told myself. You'll get through this. The Eleanor Roosevelt quote my mom always told me surfaced. You must do the thing you think you cannot do. Summer school at John Hope College Prep High School1 was set up in a way that made it difficult for students to enjoy themselves and learn anything. The students were forced to sit in one classroom for four hours straight save for one ten-minute break. In the stifling heat of the Chicago summer, the air conditioning flickered on and off based on the mood of the construction workers at the school. And Ms. Taylor, my mentor teacher, certainly did nothing to make the students' time worthwhile. She began each day by writing an agenda (a list of assignments) on the board. By itself, this was not an unusual practice. However, most teachers would generally take the time to go over such an agenda with their students  guiding them through the day's activities, showing the students how their daily work related to overarching classroom goals, and answering questions. Ms. Taylor, on the other hand, felt that her daily agendas were self-explanatory, and so she would remain seated at her desk as the students entered the classroom. If (when) the students did not immediately begin working on the list of assignments, her favored method of classroom management involved yelling (from her desk, of course) motivating phrases like, EXCUSE ME! and YOU BETTER GET THAT WORK DONE! When the students chose to ignore Ms. Taylor's yelling altogether, the vice principal of the school would treat the students to a forty-minute lecture that would ensure their good behavior until roughly ten minutes after the vice principal had exited the room. At that point, Ms. Taylor would resort back to yelling her signature phrases and reminding the students of the vice principal's meaningless threats to have them thrown out of summer school and held back a year. It would be easier to place all blame on the students for their behavior if the work they were being asked to complete were actually interesting or enriching. Unfortunately, the work Ms. Taylor demanded of the students consisted of nothing more than piles and piles of unrelated, elementary-level worksheets. After observing the high school students complete a worksheet on street signs one day (yes, you read that correctly  street signs), I began to plan what I thought would be a masterful lesson. I reasoned that the students misbehaved because they were bored. Who wouldn't near the point of death-by-boredom after four hours of inane worksheets? In my lesson, I would incorporate discussion, community-building exercises, literature, and other academically stimulating activities. How could it fail? My carefully planned-out lesson in hand, I stand in front of the class the following Monday. I decide to begin class with a simple activity in which each student will introduce him or herself and then tell the class something he or she enjoys doing outside of school. This sort of activity, I figure, will allow me to get to know the students a little bit, begin to learn their names, and build community in the classroom. The students eye me warily as I begin to explain the activity and then promptly decide that listening to me or participating in the activity is out of the question. I call on one student to introduce himself and begin the activity, but he cannot be heard over the roar of the classroom, and the students don't bat an eye at my request to quiet down. My mind floods with panic as I try to decide whether or not to proceed with the activity. Shit! I'll look like a fool if I give up after one student. Maybe they'll quiet down if I keep going. I attempted to continue with my plan, but the classroom was so loud that I couldn't hear each student's introduction unless I approached him or her individually. When I made it halfway through the class, I knew I looked like a complete idiot, but there was no turning back at that point. Right on time, my supervising teacher from my internship program2 arrived to observe my teaching. My lesson soon dissolved into a pathetic display of Ms. Taylor yelling at the students for misbehaving while I stood lamely by the whiteboard, staring at my shoes. My supervising teacher, LaTina, mercifully led me, after a few minutes of this humiliation, out of the room to discuss my lesson. My eyes filled to the brim with hot tears of shame, and, upon being asked how I felt the lesson had gone, I broke down crying. If my life were one of those inner-city-school-meets-white-suburban-teacher movies, this would be the point in the movie when I would make a breakthrough with my students and, following the requisite heartwarming movie montage, become the best teacher ever, send all my students to college, and even save a few lives in the meantime. However, my life did not follow this cookie-cutter plot structure this past summer, and I learned that the silver screen had failed in capturing what it truly means to be an effective teacher in an inner-city school. I would be lying if I claimed to have had a breakthrough moment with my students, but, if nothing else, I was persistent. After that first awful day of teaching, the vice principal gave me the chance to spend my six weeks in another classroom. But, as my gut instinct told me to do at the time, I made the conscious decision to stay in my classroom for the remainder of the summer. My pride as a teacher definitely played a role in this decision, but the main reason I stayed had to do with my desire to prove to my students that (one) they could not scare me off that easily and (two) that I would not give up on them. And with my persistence (and a few minor threats from the vice principal), my students gradually began to receive my lessons better. By the time three of the six weeks had gone by, I was teaching full-time. At this point, I had come to accept that my mentor was not a person from whom I was going to learn much (except what not to do, that is). Not when her idea of helping me involved declaring to the students, I don't care if she [i.e., me] looks like she's twelve  you still have to listen to her! Instead of following her method of simply keeping the students busy, I designed a short unit that would focus heavily on the students' writing skills  skills that the students would need in order to successfully obtain a job or attend college. The assignment I gave my students asked them to write about challenges they had faced in their own lives  and if my students were good at anything, they were good at making their private lives public in their writing. Through journal entries and personal narratives, I learned that my students were dealing with heavier situations than I could have imagined. Some of my students wrote about the pain of having a parent who was addicted to illegal drugs; others recognized the powerful impact the loss of a family member had had on their lives; others reflected on their own experiences in jail or juvenile detention; and still others wrote about the experience of becoming a single teenage parent. But along with these heartbreaking stories, I also read about students who loved to sing, to dance, to draw, to play sports, to spend time with family and friends, and to attend church. I read about students who were nervous about playing drums in church, and who were trying to keep their grades up so they could play for their school's basketball team. My students' writing made it painfully clear that they were simply normal kids who had been forced to grow up in very difficult situations. But before this essay starts to sound like a carbon copy of Freedom Writers 3, I must be honest. Despite the wonderful anecdotes my students were sharing with me, each day in that classroom was utterly exhausting. I thought my carefully scaffolded lessons and increasingly positive relationships with my students would eliminate my classroom-management problems, but, unfortunately, I was wrong. The same students who told me that they had liked having a teacher who actually cared continued to talk while I was talking, continued to ignore the assignments I had asked them to complete, and continued to disrespect me when they didn't like what I had to say. Despite the good I felt I was doing (and I'm embarrassed to admit this), I was counting down the days until I could get out of there  counting down the days until my lexicon would consist of more than the phrases stop talking, sit down, be quiet, pay attention, listen up, and do your assignment. Indeed, the frustration I felt trying to manage that classroom became unbearable at times. There were many more days after my first lesson that brought me to tears. In fact, on one of my last days in the classroom (to complete a somewhat unfortunate rhetorical circle), a particularly humiliating interaction with a disrespectful student prompted me leave Ms. Taylor to manage the classroom while I took a moment to cry in the privacy of the bathroom. Reflecting back on my experience teaching summer school in CPS, I have bittersweet feelings. On the one hand, I could not have paid to obtain such an incredible learning experience, and I believe, despite all the challenges I faced, that I had a positive influence on at least a few of my students. On the other hand, however, I am reluctant to return to CPS. Maybe this reluctance makes me a selfish person. After all, if nothing else, my experience working with Ms. Taylor has proven to me just how badly urban schools need quality teachers. Be that as it may, I believe that students in urban schools (given all the environmental forces such students are up against), need stability too. I realize, at this point in my life, that I don't know myself well enough yet to know whether or not I could withstand such a difficult teaching situation for an extended period of time. I plan to teach in a suburban area after graduation, but my heart and my vote (in terms of educational policy, that is) will always be with my students in Chicago.

ENG.G0.26.1,Autoethnography,English,Creative Writing,"My eyes shifted between a copy of Austen's Pride and Prejudice, the worn assignment sheet, and the ocean of white on the computer screen in front of me. Hopeless. Why did I take 10th grade honors English when my brain obviously hibernates during the summer months? The words thesis statement loomed forebodingly in bold type. I opened Internet Explorer for a Google search. A few clicks later I found, thesis: a position that is maintained by argument. Alright, that's not an entirely new concept. I read the assignment sheet for the millionth time. My eyes lingered on, consider the following examples. Would using one of the given examples for my paper be encouraged or considered cheating? I leaned back in my swivel chair and sighed, wishing the instructions explicitly told me what my teacher wanted. Honors English already felt overwhelming and I hadn't even started school yet. The papers I wrote before 10th grade were mostly reports, or essays that were meant to answer specific questions. On multiple occasions I had to do a career study, which entailed researching a profession and regurgitating the facts in my own words. The rubric had a checklist that included specific content requirements, as well as things like paper length, grammatical accuracy, proper use of MLA, and of course, a reminder to put your name and date in the header. In 9th grade English, the goal was to recite the teacher's thoughts about The Importance of Being Earnest by discussing the theme of honesty, or something equally idiotic, while adhering to the five paragraph essay format. These early high school papers were completely uninteresting; there was no need for imaginative thought, only thorough archival notes. However, when I received my summer reading packet for honors English, the freedom of the paper assignments surprised me. It was a new challenge to have to come up with my own paper topic, and state it as a thesis. With one week left of summer, I couldn't put off writing my Pride and Prejudice paper any longer. After looking at cliff notes for inspiration, I decided that my argument was going to be that Mr. Darcy's mansion, Pemberley, is symbolic of his true character. I only quoted one passage, and wrote the whole paragraph out after my introduction, which used up a sizable portion of the two page length requirement. The body of my paper was similar to a close reading, though I never knew that term in high school. My writing process was plagued by doubt, and the pressure to meet the new higher standards of honors English caused a lot of anxiety. The end result was a wholly unremarkable paper in most respects. It was not the best or worst thing I'd ever written, and it was only one of several English essays I wrote that summer. What makes the Pemberley essay so memorable is that it marked my first attempt at writing the type of paper that is expected at the university level. I had to formulate a thesis and support it with textual evidence without a checklist style rubric to guide me. I also couldn't regurgitate my teacher's ideas; I hadn't even met her yet. For the first time I didn't know what the teacher wanted, so I had to rely on my own creativity. While my writing still lacked a great deal of sophistication, my words were more my own than they had ever been. Four years later, I found myself flipping through the same copy of Pride and Prejudice. This time I was beginning to write a midterm paper for an introductory literature class at The University of Michigan. The assignment description was long, full of thought provoking quotes and questions. It pointed to different options to consider while still leaving room for interpretation and originality. After reading my professor's provocative prompts, I immediately latched onto the idea of using Elizabeth Bennett in Pride and Prejudice to discuss the conflict between the desire for autonomy and the pressure to adhere to social norms. A hypothetical outline started taking shape in my head. Surprised by my own inspiration, I tore through my folder to find the handout from Dr. John Gregory's popular conduct book for women. Before I knew it, my fingers were taking over the keyboard and quoting Dr. Gregory to begin my introduction. Other ideas kept pouring out until a very pregnant paragraph dominated the computer screen. When I went back to reread, I found wonderful sentences that joined forces to create an introduction that was mostly incoherent. If only a perfect introduction could be created that quickly! I let myself be frustrated for a brief moment before going in for another attempt. Three pages, and a couple days later, I still wasn't satisfied with my thesis. The idea was there, but its presentation needed serious revision. I sought my professor during office hours for help. She suggested that I use two sentences to convey my thesis, the first to set up the opposition to my argument, and the second to reject that idea in favor of my own. The concept of framing my thesis with this two pronged approach was foreign to me, but it worked beautifully. I addressed my concerns about passive voice and effective transitions in our meeting, but the only major issue my professor found with my paper was that I had not yet include the required close reading. I left office hours with fresh determination. For the next few days I agonized over where I could inject a close reading into my paper without disrupting the momentum. No matter what I tried, an effective solution eluded me. The night before it was due, I emailed the semi-polished paper to a friend for feedback. I considered my paper mostly done, though it still lacked the close reading and a conclusion. Forty-five minutes later I received my paper back, covered with red corrections; it was a merciless massacre. Shocked, I began to scrutinize his criticisms, many of which only succeeded in desecrating the voice of my paper. I angrily clicked reject change on more than half of the red insertions or deletions, and began passionately defending my writing to my friend via instant messenger. When my roommate started laughing at my rage, I realized how personal my paper had become. If the close reading doesn't work, why should I compromise an excellent paper to satisfy my professor? The obvious answer would be, to get a good grade, but my pride won out. I turned in my paper without a close reading, and without most of the corrections my well intentioned friend had made for me. A week later, my professor handed back our papers. I held my breath as I flipped to the back page to see my grade. When I saw the letter A, I let out a semi audible squeal. My professor wrote in her comments that she could not penalize this exceptional paper, as my rebellion against the close reading was in the spirit of my thesis itself. I had never thought of Elizabeth Bennett's struggle for autonomy as analogous to my own, but it was a very clever justification. I left class convinced that I was holding the best writing of my academic career. Looking back a year later, I wonder if the Pride and Prejudice paper actually marks my best scholastic writing, or if I'm biased because of my deep level of personal investment in the paper. Perhaps both are true and it's that enthusiasm that makes the paper so captivating. Ultimately, what really makes the paper remarkable is that I absolutely refused to compromise any part of my writing, even at the risk of receiving a lower grade. It was a bold choice, certainly not one I would have made in high school. While writing the 10th grade honors English paper, I was not the only one desperately wishing the teacher had given us a more directive assignment. Bloom captures the collective mindset accurately, 'Just tell me what you want,' our students ask- 'and I'll give it to you in order to get a good grade' (46). High school students are used to receiving specific essay instructions and they grow dependent on them. They know their grade usually relies on presenting the teacher with specific ideas in a specific format. Some classes, such as my honors English class, encourage more independent thought, but too few high school teachers challenge their students in that way. When beginning any writing assignment, there will always be that first step in which the student must discern what the instructor is asking for, but that does not mean there is always a singular path to achieving it. According to Bloom, only the bold, the hyperconfident, or na�ve have the courage to speak for themselves instead of becoming their teachers' ventriloquists (46). While this is likely to be true for high school students, I question the validity of Bloom's statement in the university setting. One of the largest differentiations between high school and college writing seems to be the weight placed on independent thought. For example, my freshman English professor reserved A grades for students who presented original and unique arguments in their papers. Topics discussed in class were fair game, but not eligible for top grades, no matter how well written. The policy pushed freshman to think critically and demonstrated that it was no longer acceptable to simply be the teachers' ventriloquists. Most students were eager to accept this challenge, and easily understood the advantage of creating a paper that stood out from their classmates. Bloom fails to give university students credit for their intellectual ingenuity. Both of my Pride and Prejudice papers mark important mile stones in the process of developing a unique voice in my writing. Honors English challenged me to discover a voice that did not imitate my teacher's. It forced me to search beyond regurgitating ideas, though I was only partially successful since cliff notes ended up being the springboard for my argument. In my university Lit class, innovative ideas surfaced quickly, but I struggled with the conflict between adhering to the assignment and writing an uncompromising paper that satisfied my own objective. My choice to risk getting a lower grade demonstrated a deep personal connection to my writing that I had never experienced before. It also exuded an extremely high level of courage, even bold hyperconfidence as Bloom would say. While I hope that in the future I do not find myself in the position to disregard the assignment parameters set by my professors, my goal is to continue making my academic writing my own. I want to push myself to make new and bold choices in my writing that work to advance the never-ending process of developing my individual voice.

ENG.G0.38.3,Return to Suomi,English,Creative Writing,"The must of the old farmhouse seared my nostrils with recollections of a visit from long ago. I remembered this place, although more than a decade has passed since I was here last. Memories flashed in my mind of a time when my grandmother was still alive. I only met her once in my lifeyet I still remember the only words she ever spoke to me. I was sitting on the lap of this unfamiliar old woman that I knew I was supposed to love, even if I was barely nine years old and utterly terrified of her. My mom stood next to me and translated the foreign but familiar words that spewed from this stranger's mouth. The conversation was awkward and strained. My grandmother yearned to communicate with her youngest grandchildren whom she'd only met in pictures and stories. My little sister, with her big brown eyes, had a look of desperation and anxiety on her face, and I sensed that we shared the same feeling. We wanted to feel warmth for Mumu, but there wasn't tenderness for a stranger we hardly knew. She stroked my hair and patted my arm, then turned to my mother and muttered some indecipherable language. Mumu looked into my eyes as she held me tight on her lap. With all seriousnessfor she knew it might be her only opportunity to reassure my sister and me of thisshe said it. I love you. Said Mumu. I love you too, I replied. But the words came out of my mouth sounding more foreign than Finnish. I barely recognized it as speech. I said this out of habit, much like I would unwittingly reply to a thank you with an automatic you're welcome. Mumu died three years later, before I ever had a chance to tell her how I felt in earnest. I made my decision to go to Finland in late April of this past year and a month later I found myself on a plane headed across the Atlantic Ocean. I remembered bits and pieces of my prior visit to Finland from when I was eight years old, like playing in the incredible snow drifts near the farmhouse in Iisalmi and creeping through the abandoned barn that once housed cattle but where now only the eerie odor of barnyard animals remained. Last time I'd been there it was dark winter, but this time it was bright summer. Driving down the highway from the airport to my uncle's house seemed familiar. As a young girl, I can still remember looking up and out the window and seeing the hanging cliffs, remnants of the last ice age, on either side of the road and feeling like I was still in Michigan. Yet now, as a young woman I peered out the car at these ancient walls once again and feelings of the arctic overwhelmed me. The dark and bare cliffs, although no more than thirty feet tall, exuded strength, sagacity, and age. White birch trees dotted the flat terrain, while occasional daring pines desperately clung to life on the cliffs. Later that day my aunt took me to the Finnish Lotta museum. Named after the woman who started the organizations, the Lottas were female nurses who served in the First and Second World Wars and cared for the wounded Finnish soldiers on the battlefield and in the safe confines of the forest. As we walked through the museum, my aunt asked me questions about the Lottas, seeking to pick my brain of any prior knowledge stored in the recesses of my mind. I had nothing to say to her. I was ashamed to admit that I did not know anything about the history of Finland. She looked disappointed, but her frown soon changed to a grin when we entered the theatre to watch a documentary on the Lottas. But as we sat alone in the darkened room, she turned to me and the look of dissatisfaction returned. I think it is terrible that Arja did not teach you anything about the history of your country. She did a very bad thing not to teach you girls Finnish. It's selfish, what she did. Her words stung me. I never thought of my mom as being selfish for not teaching me her language. Upon hearing my aunt's comments, my cheeks grew red and I became very angry yet also sad. I didn't feel Finnish anymore. I felt like a phony. The next day my uncle took me for a car ride through Helsinki. We drove through the entirety of the city in about an hour. Seeing Helsinki from within the confines of a car was surreal. I wanted to breath the Baltic air, smell the scents of the city, hear the sounds of feet pounding the cobblestone roads, and listen to the trams on the lines. But instead, I sat inside the heated car with Bryan Adams in the background, listening to my uncle explain the significance of each place we drove past in his broken English. I stared at the history from behind the glass. We did not get out of the car until he dropped me off to meet my cousins. On my third day in Finland, my youngest cousin, who is twenty-two, and her friends came to my uncle's house for a night of sauna and drinking. Noora drove up with three of her friends from high school. They brought ciders with them and jovially spoke to one another. It seemed like they were probably reminiscing about old times shared together before they found their separate paths to adulthood. They sat around the kitchen table gesticulating wildly while abrupt bouts of loud laughter filled the air. I sat at the corner seat of the table, smiling uneasily, fidgeting with my drink, staring into my cup. I laughed nervously in accordance with their hearty chuckles, although the sounds I made seemed quite misplaced among their confident banter. After they left to go to the sauna, I went back to the computer and wrote e-mails back home; trying hard to hold back the tears that I knew were coming. Flashbacks of my first and last visit with Mumu whirled in my headthe awkwardness of not saying a thing, the isolation of not understanding anything around me, and the sadness of longing to know my family but always feeling like an outsider. The feelings of rejection persisted throughout my stay in Finland, including during the trip north that I made with my uncle to my mom's birthplace of Iisalmi. The drive to Iisalmi took two days, as we made a stop in a tiny former railroad town called Haapamaki. We stayed at my cousin Markuu's house with his family. His house was ancient and warm, and it was obvious he and his wife had put a lot of work into remodeling it. The first hour there was petrifying. Once again, I sat on the corner couch and said little to nothing. I'd never met my cousin Markuu before, and to be quite honest, and I didn't know he even existed until we arrived at his inviting house. This was my second time in three days meeting an unknown cousin, an experience which can be quite unpleasant with a language barrier. But Markuu made a sincere effort to welcome me, and took me on a tour of his little town. I sensed isolation and sadness in Haapamakia small old rail town in the middle of Finlandas we drove around in his decade old station wagon. We saw the town theater that was also used as a dance hall on weekdays, the sole schoolhouse that educated kindergartners to adolescents, the single restaurant, and the town square where a bear had caused quite a stir the week before by leaving the forest and parading about the parking lot. He drove me to a secluded area of the town and that is where I saw the humor in where he lived. There was an entire dwarf village constructed out in the country in this unsuspecting town. Some crazy old man with too much time on his hands had built an entire town suited for hobbits. The dichotomy was confusingin an old rail ghost town was a vibrant little hobbit village in the midst of its forest. Even though he had seen it probably hundreds of times, we still laughed over the sheer lunacy of this man's life's work. Later that night as I lay in bed trying to fall asleep, I thought of why my sister and I hadn't been to Finland more often. What was it that my mom was hiding us from? Why did she choose to isolate us from her family? The sheer distance made rare visits understandable, but the fact that she never showed us any pictures or told us any stories about the people from her homeland struck me as odd. I began to side with my aunt in thinking that my mother was incredibly selfish. That night, sleeping in my bed at my cousin's warm house, I became so angry that night at her for cutting us off from our relatives and making it nearly impossible for us to meaningfully communicate with them. I would always be the odd man out in this family. I would never be a part of the talks over dinner, the reminiscing, and the jokes. I was the American cousin whom everyone heard of but never had met. The next morning a note was left on the table that read Thank you for your visiting here in Haapamaki. It was really nice to meet you both. Have a good time in Iisalmi and wellcome [sic] next time! The usual Finnish breakfast consisting of un-sliced mild farmer's cheese, dark rye bread, tomatoes, pickles, ham, butter, and khaviaor coffeewas left out for us. My uncle Esa and I continued on our way to Iisalmi shortly thereafter. The drive to Iisalmi seemed like an endless stream of small lakes, towering pines, patches of birch trees, and flat terrain. I knew we were close to my mom's home when we hadn't seen civilization for about an hour. It was peculiar to see the home my mom grew up in. It was such a small house, I couldn't fathom that it had housed ten people at one time. Behind the modest two-story house were two tall pine trees that symmetrically framed the house. Alongside the left of the house was a long one-story barn that now contained motorcycles and cars that my cousin usedancient tools of a farmer now replaced by the conveniences of modern society. Taking the in scenery was breathtaking yet disturbingthere was no trace of civilization for milesno people, no houses, no cars, and no buildings as far as the eye could see. Opposite the barn was my grandmother's modest home. It was built for her in the late 1970s after my mom's older brother inherited the farm from his father. Until her death in 1997, my grandmother lived in the tiny house filled with decades old crocheted blankets and embroidered pillows. This is where I would be staying the evening. Late that night, alone in my dead grandmother's home while everyone else stayed at the main house, I stayed awake well into the morning. The midnight sun was only a month away from its peak, so at two in the morning the sun was just above the horizon. I stared out the window toward the lake that bordered the farmhouse. Looking around the room, I saw all of the signs of my grandmother even though my uncle and his wife had been living in her house for nearly five years. There were paintings on the walls of my cousins, uncles, and aunts. Crosses dotted the walls alongside figures of Christ. Old black and white pictures from a century ago lined the shelf above the headboard, and even when I shut my eyes tightly I could still feel the eyes of my cousins and God burning into me, demanding an answer for my decade long absence. I was scared out of my wits that night in the Arctic Circle. The darkness never came nor did respite from the thoughts of my dead grandmother and my own mother's past that tormented me. I slept only an hour or two because every time I opened my eyes I thought I caught a glimpse of a shadow or a figure in the corner of the room. I felt my grandmother's spirit all around meinfusing me with the spirit of Finland, telling me that life was going to be okay, and that I belonged here even if I might not feel it in this moment. Looking out the window, I was only comforted by miles of uninhabited plains and an immortal sunset. I awoke in the morning with no ghost floating above me. My uncle Esa and I left that day since I was scheduled to return to the United States later that week. I was sad to leave the history of the farm, yet also relieved to be leaving the desolation and sadness of this rural life in a place where the veil of night never fully enveloped the summer sky. I returned home with a desire to learn more about Finland and its culture. Most importantly, I became determined to learn the language and nearly five months later I am just beginning to teach myself Finnish. When my mom found out about my plans to study abroad in Turku (the oldest city in Finland located on the west coast near the Baltic Sea), she sent me a little surprise gift: the first book I ever read in Finnish. The frail little book, covered in bite marks and childish scribbles, was filled with simple renderings of barnyard animals, each with a title underneath the picture. Upon opening the book I discovered a small note scrawled on pink paper that read, Start small and eventually everything else will fall into place. At that moment, I finally let out all the frustrations of my visit to Finland and of my inability to understand my heritage. I wept for a few minutes, and then slowly fell asleep, only to wake up the next morning with no better understanding of my roots.

ENG.G0.57.1,"Hire Me, You Know You Want To",English,Creative Writing,"Career Fair 2006, the first step to success. What the career center handbook does not mention is the weeks, even yearlong preparation work before the big day. The engineering honor societies would normally post all the company information online two weeks before the actual career fair in early September each year, to aid engineering students through what most upperclassmen refer to as living hell because of its machine-like elimination process and cruelty. Desperation and depression syndromes are not uncommon among engineering students in the months following because of the impact career fair leaves behind. A friend has once painstakingly described his career fair experience to be a beggar in a suit, and you see these beggars everywhere: dressed in suits from outlet stores; hunched back with heavy backpacks full of engineering books; and beaten harshly by the reality while their eyes scream desperation. However, for freshman, career fair is practically a shopping spree. One month into college, their resumes are blank while they struggle to calculate an expected GPA. After they face the reality of the market and decide that they are not in any hurry or any competent position in finding an internship or a full-time job, they scurry through suits and ties and high heels while maintain their eye contact perpetually at table level, only to momentarily stop in front of their desired station and collect freebies: from mechanical pencil to stuffed animals to electronic laser tags. Later, they would triumphantly show their despaired upperclassmen their bagful of finds and maybe even spare a toy or two. Little do they know that only a year from now, they would be the ones shinning away from the pepperoni pizza smelled freshman in fear of crumpling and staining their well-ironed shirts. 8:30am, catch the recruiters while their morning coffees are still fresh. Dressed in the more traditional black suit and black leather pumps, I am doing a last minute check in the basement bathroom mirror before I walk up to the Pierpont Duderstat connector on north campus, already crammed with engineering students, waiting patiently inline along the walls to talk to the recruiters. A good candidate knows the importance of keeping composure and presenting themselves even when no one is watching. 1 The recruiters at the engineering career fair are flown in from all over the United States, hired by more than two hundred companies ranging from small consulting firms to big corporations, to recruit the best of the best, namely Michigan graduates. The competition is still fierce, especially between students of the same major. My friends constantly show their frustration by telling me that they cant believe the guy sitting quietly besides them in their engineering course interviewed for the same company as them and got an offer while they were turned down. Although that being the downside of career fair, it has always been interesting going to class on the day of, and seeing everyone dressed in their best outfit, mostly new clothes since we are used to jeans and Michigan sweatshirts. Even the guy with funky T-shirt of a baby head had changed into a conservative white dress shirt and a pair of black pants over black shoes. Never ever wear white socks with black shoes and black pants, because they are like flashlights that turn on and off when you are walking. A career center advisor once warned us during a workshop called Making a Good Impression. To stop all the female audience from nudging their male friends and snickering, the advisor said: Ladies, you dont want to wear too much jewelry. Stick to the basic: no dangling earrings, over-sized necklaces and definitely no rings unless you are engaged or married. I say this not only because its very distracting for the recruiters, but also because once I had a girl who wore some really spiky rings on her right hand. Unfortunately she was a bone crasher when it comes to hand shake, and she actually injured the recruiter while shaking hands. I head some grunts and laughs, but also saw some people taking notes religiously. As far as I know, job hunting becomes an obsession as we approach senior year. Even the computer science geek who used to hide in computer labs and program all night long is now eager to talk to Google and Microsoft representatives. Never chew gum. It makes you produce too much saliva, and you may accidentally spit on the recruiter. Instead, eat mints. Pop a tic-tac in your mouth and chew on it to make the fresh feeling come out quicker. The little secret is that no matter how early in the morning you have to talk to a recruiter, always practice talking before hand either by reading a newspaper, chatting with a friend or even singing to yourself in the shower. This tip may seem trivial right now, but it would prevent you from stumbling over your words, which is very likely to happen when you are nervous and anxious to get a job. However eager you are, remember your goal at the career fair is to get an interviewing opportunity, never to get a job offer. As mechanical as all these tips may sound, this was how I was taught. I remember clearly the first time I felt the pressure to find a job. The job itself may not be that important, but its the start of a chain reaction: your first internship would help you land an even better internship for next summer, and with two internships on hand, you are in good shape in finding the full-time job youve always dreamt about when you graduate. Its a body stretch before you start climbing the corporate ladder, intimidating but real life. Starting from freshman year, its all about resume building, work experience. Everything we do seem to end up being that one extra line on our resumes, so that it makes you look worthy to the recruiter you finally get a chance to talk to at the career fair. So tell me about yourself. Its not unusual for recruiters to ask interviewing questions during career fair after their find you as a very prominent potential candidate. To reach this step, all you need is a strong resume and a good first expression. The trick here is to be prepared. Elevator talk, an introduction ranging from 10 seconds to 30 seconds about you, mainly used to sell yourself to the executive you meet presumptively in the elevator. Also prepare a longer version of elevator talk in case the imaginary elevator breaks down. Be sure to practice the speech in front of your mirror at home, watch for eye contacts, mouth movements, hand gestures, standing positions and distance. Remember: a) Before you move eagerly to your top priority companies stands, practice the speech at your low priority company stands to make sure that you are no longer nervous and are comfortable talking in perhaps the most uncomfortable outfit you own. b) Have your resume ready in your hand, dont be fishing for it in your book bag on the spot, no one appreciates an unprepared job hunter and a crumpled piece of paper. After shaking hand with the recruiter with your right hand and your resume in your left hand, you ask politely: Would you like to take a look at my resume? Smile. You then use your right hand to offer him/her your resume with the bottom facing him/her. Be confident even if your GPA is on the low side, because its definitely not the only factor that comes into play when its job hunting. When I was volunteering as a resume sorter at my past employers stand during career fair, I knew there were as many high GPA resumes in the No box as the number of low GPA resumes in the Yes box; both boxes hidden in the secret corners behind the tables and posters. GPA is definitely not the sole indicator of how much you worth in the professional world, in which the concept is a combination of things. You assemble your strengths and even your weaknesses together to present them as a whole, on a sheet of paper, to sell yourself. I was appalled when one of the recruiters hastily handed me my good friends resume and told me to toss it in the No box. Not only is his GPA near perfect but also he has devoted most of his time to volunteering. I couldnt think of anything thats unattractive about him, maybe his Singaporean accent and short and skinny figure? I couldnt help but wonder what had made the recruiter decide that he is not worthy. From afar, behind the shoulders of students and recruiters, he was waving and smiling at me, and then giving me a thumbs up. I smiled back while I stapled his resume with the evaluation sheet and tossed them away with the rest of the unlucky resumes. This kind of things happen all the time, its a survival of the fittest. No one is there is there to take your hand while you walk those hallways like a resume distributing machine; no one is there to wipe your tears when a company turns you down; and no one is there to give you a pat on the shoulder when you have to talk to a cold faced recruiter enthusiastically. To look at the bigger picture, everyone in the engineering school worth approximately the same when we graduate from Michigan with a Bachelors degree, although it doesnt feel the same now since we are still in the same pond. In the end, it all comes down to how well you know yourself, because that determines how well you present yourself. A technical communication professor once told me that he had a student coming to him for help months after graduation because he still couldnt get a job offer. The professor couldnt understand why because the student had a perfect 4.0. He had one look at the students resume and he saw the problem: the students resume was almost blank. He didnt put in any of the research, work experience, and volunteering he had done because he didnt think they were important enough to mention, and so he stayed humble and jobless. Since the beginning of freshman year, Ive been collecting tips from my own experience, career workshops and even managers themselves on talking to recruiters and doing interviews. After a while, it became a cycle of wanting your resume to look good, so that you are qualified for more things to put on your resume, this in turn makes it look even better, and so on. Like rolling a snowball, its always hard to squeeze out that small icy sphere in the beginning, but once you have a medium sized ball, its easy to just roll it in the snow and make it even bigger. This is a path most people would end up choosing in life regardless of all the colorful dreams they have had when they just entered college. In the end, we are all dressed up in the same clothes while trying to sell ourselves to the same companies, but with different speeches and resumes. Its an art, and mastering this art is an unspoken must-learn survival kit before graduation. Job hunting has nothing to do with the real you; successful job hunters are all the same: they are all well dressed, well mannered young professionals who are open-minded extraverts, good at communication, flexible, and positive. They are the live versions of career center handbook, and they are the ones with all the job offers. The cynical guy who once gave me the sarcastic comment of beggar in a suit now has offers from five engineering consulting firms, and three world famous corporations. One company even offered to pay his tuition, but he is a totally different person when he is out of the interviewing room, sad and depressed, anti-social and sullen faced because the process stresses him out so much. By junior year, Ive perfected my routine to the point that I can recite my resume and my work experience like my birthday. After all that behavioral interview, case studies, social setting interviews and phone interviews, I know exactly what the recruiters look for and I recognize the spark in their eyes when they find what they are looking for. This doesnt mean Ive never failed. Of course I have, and thats how I learned and excelled. Normally you can judge can interviewers skillfulness by how much emotion he/she shows during an interview. Young interviewers tend to show a lot of personal preferences and emotions, whereas older managers know how to keep the same calm friendly face throughout, not showing even a trace of like or disapprove. During one of my first interviews, I encountered what is often referred to as the silent treatment, where the interviewer waits patiently and silently after you have already finished answering their question. The goal is to see how well you cope with tension and stress. Most inexperienced students would panic and try to add things they did not intent to say initially and thus put themselves at the risk of performing badly. My interviewer asked me to tell him about my last work experience (which is an extremely common question during interviews). I said: I did cash flow, accounting, and customer service. ,Pause, panic, &and then other than that, I didnt really do much& Half way through my sentence I sensed the subtle twisting of eyebrows on my interviewers face, so I panicked even more and tried to make up for my mistake by saying: What I meant was that the job itself didnt require much anyways (which basically suggested that either it wasnt an important position, or that it was and I didnt take it seriously). The subtle hint became an obvious troubled stare, and I knew I screwed up. I learned fairly quickly, and then using what I learned from my last failure to really polish and refine my style so that I can do it even better then next time. The next time I was given the silent treatment, I looked at the interviewer straight in the eye, smiled and told him: So thats what I did for my last job. I enjoyed it very much, but I think Im ready to move on. The interviewer is only human. Sometimes they may be more nervous than you are. I would say this is the key to confidence. Knowing that the interviewer or recruiter you talk to is just another co-worker youve worked with in the past; another GSI youve had in your class; another person youve wheeled pass in Wal-Mart is the key to confidence and being comfortable. Its an art, I say, to be able to convince someone you are the right candidate without actually selling yourself. You do that by pretending to talk to your interviewer in a casual setting, such as in a restaurant or a classroom. You get them engaged by showing your knowledge and interest in their companies, and then you dive into your own qualities. You should also know your own values and dont try to appear higher by acting over-confident and dont try to appear too eager by acting too humble. Finding the right balance can help you to leverage what you have with what you lack, to cover up your weaknesses with your strengths. I like walking down the hallway in high heels, intentionally making rhythmic thumps with my steps. It boosts my confidence for I know Im already making a statement. Not afraid of facing all the turning heads, Im making long eye contacts while keeping my head high and a confident smile on my face. Just like that, I learned to talk to recruiters and do interviews. Ive also settled myself with two internships so far, and well on my way up the corporate ladder. I am a machine, a well-dressed robot that knows all the dos-and-donts, who can camouflage as the type of person most companies want to hire, because Im just too afraid to walk down the road less traveled by, so I picked the one chosen by most of my precedents.

ENG.G0.30.1,SIgnificance of Menstruation in Joyce's Ulysses,English,Critique/Evaluation,"Throughout James Joyce's Ulysses, the protagonist, Leopold Bloom confronts and questions depictions of the idealized female form. For example, in one episode he investigates whether or not the statues of nude goddesses at Dublin's National Gallery have all the same orifices that he does. This episode, referenced repeatedly throughout the text, is just one of many attempts to complicate idealization and a culture that neglects to address the totality of the body through frank explorations of bodily realities. One such bodily reality, menstruation, offers a particular form of commentary because of its intimate ties to femininity. The depictions of menstruation throughout the novel are wildly different, from the stifled portrayal of Gerty Macdowell in Nausica, to Gerty's sensational act of exposing her bloody clout in the hallucinatory Circe, to Molly Bloom's frank, realistic frustration in Penelope. But in their own way, all portrayals ironize traditional constructions of femininity, and ask a reader to critically consider a culture that promotes gendered behavior but dismisses bodily realities of sexual difference. Before we can assess the significance of Gerty's shocking reappearance in Circe, we must first investigate the ways in which Gerty's narrative treatment in Nausica necessitates this type of subversive addendum. In other words, what violence justifies and provokes such sensational resistance? An analysis of the prose style provides insight. Unlike Joyce's intimate portrayals of Leopold Bloom and Molly Bloom as narrated in the first-person, Gerty is narrated in the third person  a style that emphasizes, as opposed to minimizes, distance between reader and character. The third-person narration may also reflect juvenile, self-narrated fantasies of self-importance, suggesting that this is the language of dishonest engagements as opposed to frank confrontations with reality. In this same vein, the prose style also actively suppresses or stifles anything popularly deemed ugly, vulgar or emotionally wild. This suspicious stylistic practice is introduced from the outset of the chapter. The second sentence of the opening paragraph reads, Far away in the west the sun was setting and the last glow of all too fleeting day lingered lovingly on sea and strand, on the proud promontory of dear old Howth&(284). The sentimental phrase all too fleeting day, simply negates the realities of Bloom's torturous day thus far in a wash of inappropriate clich�. The narrative style's immediate suppression of pain and struggle sets the tone for the chapter. Similarly, though the line, From everything in the least indelicate her finebred nature instinctively recoiled (299) refers to Gerty, this sentence can also be read as a lens through which to interpret the narrative style. For example, a reader can't help but note the abundance of euphemisms  the outhouse is that place (291), menstruation is that thing (296), and even an article as benign as a toddler's unsoiled diaper is referred to as his unmentionables (285). Indeed, when the content of the narrative even borders on vulgarity, the prose reasserts its control and overcompensates stylistically with euphemism after euphemism. More disturbingly, the prose style also stifles ugly emotional realities. For example, Gerty's painful account of her father's alcoholism is diffused by prose language that inappropriately sentimentalizes Gerty's situation. For example, the text explains But the vile decoction which has ruined so many heaths and homes had cast its shadow over her childhood days. Nay, she had even witness in the home circle deeds of violence caused by intemperance and has seen her own father, a prey to the fumes of intoxication, forget himself completely&(290). The content of this narrative is truly painful, but the manner in which it is presented doesn't adequately recognize or address that pain; words like nay and vile decoction are too precious and distractingly exotic to truly capture the ugliness of the situation. By this point in the novel, a careful reader should realize that this chapter's half-hearted engagement with emotion and the body is suspicious. This prose style is unlike the truthful prose of Bloom, our unconquered hero, (217). A reader must ask: why is Gerty narrated in this manner, to what end? Many argue that the narrative style of Nausica can be read as Joyce's portrait of a young Dublin woman's self-narration after deeply internalizing popular culture's representations of femininity; Gerty has been so inundated by cultural fodder that she is only equipped to tell herself her own story using these materials. Indeed, Gerty's intimate thoughts are disturbingly intertwined with the gendered machinery of consumer culture; if the preceding chapter, Cyclops, links maleness and subsequent male aggression with ideologies of nationalism, Nausica links the enactment of femininity with sentimental novels like The Lamplighter and advertisements for beauty products. For example, Gerty's physical description is interwoven with the list of beauty products she uses. The text reads, Gerty's [eyes] were of the bluest Irish blue, set off by lustrous lashes and dark expressive brows. Time was when those brows were not so silkily seductive. It was Madame Vera, directress of the Woman Beautiful page of the Princess Novellete, who had first advised her to try eyebrow line&so becoming in leaders of fashion&Then there was blushing scientifically cured and how to be tall increase your height and you have a beautiful face, but your nose?(286). In this passage the overly sentimental prose voice gives way to the language of advertisements, not only suggesting that texts like the Princess Novellete profoundly effects the ways Gerty experiences her own body, but that they are, in fact, one in the same. Gerty has so internalized the language and ideology of these magazines that they are inseparable from her experience of herself. Yet while it is plausible that the prose style of Nausica reflects Gerty's profound internalization of cultural materials and subsequent construction of her self-narrative with this equipment, there are moments in the chapter that feel like Gerty isn't corroborating with her own narration but is instead being forcibly narrated by the greater cultural script. Evidence of this can be explored in the script's absence  moments where the narrative slips up, and allows unscripted prose to intrude. Fissures between subject and narrator can be witnessed in Gerty's unsentimental anger with her companions. For example, Edy Boardman is described as an Irritable little gnat(295), a confounded little cat(297), and as a little kinnatt (297), language and sentiments that violate the greater social code of feminine appropriateness. Gerty also internally notes that Cissy Caffery whistled to show what a great person she was(301). This clunky, jealous remark lacks the obscuring sentimentality of the opening paragraph, suggesting a snapshot into Gerty's mental world that is adulterated by an external narrative voice. Additionally, the phrase &and who that knows the fluttering hopes and fears of sweet seventeen (though Gerty would never see seventeen again), can find it in his head to blame her&(288), is particularly suspect. The retrospective quality of the parenthetical aside seems uncharacteristic of Gerty's inner-monologue and instead suggests the presence of an external, narrating force. Another fissure can be detected in the use of compound words like girlwoman and dreamhusband  conspicuously innovative language that may reflect Gerty's unexplored emotional urgency and creativeness. The suspicion that Gerty possesses qualities that the narrative prose can only hint at, and the ambiguity as to if Gerty is narrating (leading) or being narrated (led), can be read as a commentary on the non-stop machine of modernity that subsumes the lives of Dublin' inhabitants; a controlling, confining force that molds narrative facts to fit an acceptable form. It is just this type of phenomenon that requires subversion later, in Circe. Yet whether or not Gerty is entirely complicit with her own stifling narration, this much is clear: for Joyce, a realist, Gerty's disembodiment and idealization must be problematized by the intrusion of base, bodily realities, like menstruation. As expected, Gerty's treatment of menstruation is in keeping with her adherence to socially appropriate norms: an account of her menstruation is so buried in the text that readers are likely to miss it. Furthermore, Gerty dumbly calls her menstruation that thing, reflecting a deep disengagement that is further juxtaposed by Bloom's frankness on the subject at the chapter's close. So while Gerty is obsessed with the pop cultural machinery of femininity, she cannot even adequately name the biological reality that makes her a female. Gerty's treatment of her own menstruation in this chapter therefore offers further commentary on the ways that appropriate females, like Gerty, aren't equipped with the tools to truthfully confront their own bodies. Further compounding this criticism is Gerty's textual ties to the Virgin Mary, the archetype of idealized, pure females. The Virgin Mary is introduced in the first paragraph of the chapter and thus, from the outset, offers a frame through which to consider Gerty's insistent purity. As the chapter continues, sounds from the nearby temperance retreat are interspersed with Gerty's narrative, contributing to the tensions between religion, salvation and sex that dominate this chapter. These religious interpolations are further explored and more highly charged in the paragraph where Gerty starts to menstruate. This paragraph opens with Canon O'Hanlon censing the sacrament and closes with the assurance that Bloom is literally worshipping at her [Gerty's] shrine (296). The juxtaposition of Gerty's menstrual blood against this religious imagery asks readers to consider the link between the church, purified body and blood, and the actual, physical bodies and blood of parishioners. Readers ask asked to probe the hypocrisy of an institution that elevates blood and body in their symbolic form, but has bred a culture that teaches women to be so shameful of their blood and bodies that they confess their menstruation to priests as if it were a sin, as Gerty did. In Nausica, Joyce gives us a portrait of a woman who is shaped by the gender expectations of the Church and the non-stop machinery of modern consumer culture. These confining forces, reflected in the confining prose, contribute to a system that won't acknowledge Gerty's pain, won't allow her tools to truthfully handle her body, and allows her to be visually consumed and subsequently dismissed by Bloom. However, Gerty's reappearance in Circe momentarily subverts these forces, and, importantly, her menstrual blood is her weapon. In doing so, Joyce allows Gerty to use menstruation, the biological reality which is most quintessentially feminine, to resist and ironize the violence done to her by virtue of her gender. In Circe, Gerty performs a heightened, perverted version of herself and a stripped-down, absurdist version of the events and themes of Nausica. Gerty's first line in Circe is a misquotation of the groom's script for a Catholic marriage ceremony; she says With all my worldly goods I thee and thou. (361). Her bungling of a religious, male script is a further perversion of her tie to the Virgin Mary and a further indictment of the way that Gerty constructs her narrative using borrowed, inappropriate texts and language. However, most jolting is the fact that Gerty does not hold a ring, but her own menstrual blood to perform the marriage ceremony. The absurdity of the scene and its conflation of the many themes of Nausica resist easy understanding and consumption, and in doing so Gerty has resisted our easy understanding and consumption. The sly peek-a-boo essence of her interaction with Bloom is also imitated and subverted in Circe. For example, in the same coy way that she exposed herself to Bloom in Nausica, she now shows coyly her bloodied clout(361), forcing him to confront biological realities of what lays behind her feminine identity and subsequent easy consumption. This perverted, sensationalized retelling of Nausica forces both Bloom and a reader to confront what has been stifled or only subtly explored in Gerty's Nausica. Furthermore, in Nausica, Gerty's code of appropriateness only allowed her to partially and untruthfully engage with her own body; though she was willing to explore those parts of herself that made her attractive to the social, male gaze, she was unequipped to acknowledge parts of her body that are socially deemed ugly or inappropriate, like menstruation. But in Circe, Gerty's compartmentalized version of her body breaks down. For example, Gerty tells Bloom in reference to her menstruation, You did that&When you saw all the secrets of my bottom drawer. (361). Her words imply a cause and effect relationship; as if her sexual episode with Bloom forced her to recognize the whole of her body, not just superficial elements that make her attractive to Bloom. This inability to omit the ugly realities of the body when confronting the sexualized body is essential to Joyce's crusade against unrealistic, untruthful and harming idealizations of women. Complicating Gerty's act of subversion in Circe is its situation as a hallucination; though readers are allowed to witness this act, the Gerty Macdowell of Nausica never actually confronts Bloom. However, the fact that Gerty's act of resistance exists in the imaginary realm only further emphasizes Gerty's actual confinement. Molly's account of menstruation in Penelope acts as foil to Gerty's stifled portrayal in Nausica, and over-the-top portrayal in Circe, but simultaneously operates in much the same way and toward the same end as these other depictions; just as Gerty's menstruation in Nausica punctuated and punctured her insistence on a sentimental unreality, Molly's menstruation in Penelope operates as a punctuation of her candid remarks by further emphasizing the reality of her body and real bodily desires. This realism, epitomized in phrases like I bet the cat itself is better off that us have we too much blood up in us and its pouring out of me like the sea (633), forces readers to confront their own comfort level with discussions of the body. Molly never waves her bloody clout in the face of many men who fantasize about her, but her frankness about her menstruation is just as shocking and complicating; Joyce therefore sensationalizes menstruation by merely normalizing it and situating it as the ordinary occurrence that it is. The above is mirrored in Molly's narrative prose. Unlike Gerty's third person narrative that is suspiciously encroached upon by external forces, Molly's fluid, slippery prose cannot even be bounded by punctuation and standardized grammar. This is not to suggest that Molly doesn't suffer from confining, gendered expectations  in fact, Molly, like Gerty, mentions beauty products like antifat pills and skin lotion (618) in conjunction with a consideration of her body  only that this is Joyce's textual depiction of a space that allows honest engagement with the body. As a bodily reality, Molly's account of menstruation operates in the same way as portrayals of other bodily realities throughout the novel: it ironizes and punctures that which is too inflated or ideal. For example, at one point Bloom recounts a memory of him and Molly at the opera. He explains that, She looked fine&Told her what Spinoza says in that book of poor papa's. Hypnotized, listening. Eyes like that.(233). However, we learn from Molly that the posturing of her body was motivated by the onset of menstruation. She explains, I smiled the best I could all in a swamp leaning forward as if I was interested(633). This portrait not only qualifies the feminine ideal by introducing the realities of menstruation, but also qualifies idealized memories and interpersonal relationships. However, like Gerty's resistance in Circe, Molly's puncturing of Bloom's self-heroic memory is complicated because Molly does not actually express the above to Bloom. Yet, this is an important moment nonetheless; the dramatic irony produced by the two very different accounts of the same episode is essential to the ultimate aims a novel that explores the tragi-comedy of the human condition. Significantly, this irony is brought on by the bodily realities that are so often ignored. In normalizing menstruation, Joyce also rightfully portrays it as a life experience with a temporal quality. Both Bloom and Molly use menstruation to access the past. For example, as Molly starts to menstruate, her mind wanders to previous episodes of menstruation. Similarly, when Bloom considers the possibility of Gerty menstruating, his mind momentarily latches on to his past, intimate experiences with menstruation, commenting that Sometimes Milly and Molly together.(301). Bloom's knowledge about Milly and Molly's menstrual cycles only results from the type of intimacy that Ulysses ultimately celebrates; this phrase reveals that the intimacy that keeps Molly and Bloom together is grounded in an awareness and familiarity with each other's bodies, menstruation and all. This sentiment is echoed in one of Bloom's poems to Molly, as recounted by Molly in Penelope. It reads, Precious one everything connected with your Glorious Body everything underlined that comes from it is a thing of beauty and joy for ever(634). This sentiment is crucial to understanding Joyce's portrait of true intimacy. As opposed to sentimental love that operates within the parameters of greater social acceptability, for Joyce, true intimacy is an acceptance and celebration of everything underlined connected to the body, even that which is deemed ugly or vulgar. Further evidence of the aforementioned is Joyce's own erotic love letters to his wife, Nora, which similarly celebrate the real-ness of bodies being intimate. So bodily realities not only serve to puncture and problematize inflations or idealizations, but once recognized and accepted, also offer the avenues to true intimacy. In Circe, Joyce sensationalizes menstruation by his extreme depiction and in Penelope he sensationalizes menstruation by revealing its ordinariness. Both portrayals problematize a reader's understanding of gender and allow a space to consider femininity, violence, and intimacy.

ENG.G0.41.2,"Seasons, Ages, Cycles: All As You Like It",English,Critique/Evaluation,"An easy place to begin an analysis of this production of As You Like It could be a discussion of its conceptual, technical, even aesthetic disharmonies relative to the play's original text. However, in the spirit of conducting analysis rather than writing review, a better starting point might be to question the possible motivations underlying directorial choices, specifically how the director might have sought to link such choices with several key thematic tones arising from the original text. In this sense, answers to these questions can be found by closely examining two major elements of the production's setting: historical orientation and set design. With these elements specifically, the production embodies the thematic parallelism of seasonal, generational, even historical cycles found abundantly in the text. Beginning with a discussion of the textual basis of the play's themes, it suffices to say that the overarching impression of intergenerational conflict is inaugurated almost immediately. In the immediate action of the play, the older generation's fear of being supplanted by the younger is reflected by Oliver's schemes against Orlando and Duke Frederick's banishment of Rosaline. Consequently, the younger generation's desire to overturn the order established by the dominant elder generation is represented by Orlando's dissatisfaction with his Oliver's tyranny and Celia's decision to leave the city with Rosalind. Also, it is represented on both symbolic and literal levels as Orlando heaves Charles, Frederick's older and champion wrestler, to his defeat during a match. However, there is another dimension to this theme added by the realities that Duke Senior is older than his usurping brother Frederick, and the servant Adam is older than his oppressive master Oliver. To fit this disparity into proper context, it helps to consider Orlando's words to Adam O good old man, how well in thee appears/The constant service of the antique world,/ [&] Thou art not for the fashion of these times, (2.3.56-58). At this point in the analysis, a historical model such as Hesiod's can be applied in which the span of human existence is broken into ages beginning with glorious golden age and degenerating to oppressive iron perpetual present of the age. In this context, Orlando's lines create comparisons between the not-so-coincidentally-named Adam, his biblical namesake, and the just, benevolent figures of a more glorious past. Similarly, the deceased Sir Rowland de Boys and the exiled Duke Senior fit quite clearly with this impression of suppressed or lost glory. One more thematic lens must be used to properly see how all these themes align: the cyclic nature of the seasons. The present of the play is situated within winter, presumably near the end, as evidenced by Duke Senior's words Here feel we not the penalty of Adam,/The seasons' difference; as the icy fang and churlish winter's wind,/Which when it bites and blows upon my body [&], (2.1.5-8), as well as the Pages' song And therefore, take the present time, With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,/For Love is crowned with the prime,/In the spring time, [etc.], (5.3.28-31). Not only to these passages situate the play within a transition from winter to spring, but the Pages' song specifically seems to inject the play with a rather optimistic note. Applying Northrup Frye's model of Shakespearean comedy, the connotations of spring such as youth, rebirth, vitality, and liberality would correspond to youthful lovers like Orlando and Rosalind who oppose characters like Frederick and thus, the established order of winter, death, stasis, and conservatism. In this sense, the Pages' song can be read as an affirmation that spring will overtake winter, and even further, that the younger generation will supplant the older. Similarly, the play's final act substantiates this interpretation, ultimately ending with the restoration of Duke Senior to power, Adam to relative health, and the glory of the golden age to the kingdom. To connect these themes with aspects of the production, it makes sense to begin simply with superficial directorial choices like set design, costuming, colors, and other such features. By comparing sets like Frederick's palace to that of the Forest of Arden, it becomes clear that the production attempts to assert a visual contrast between the locations. The palace is furnished austerely with dark, heavily finished wood panels, bleachers, and an imposing portrait of Frederick rendered without color (hidden behind this is a colorful portrait of Duke Senior). Though the austerities of color and decor might not consciously evoke themes of seasons, ages of man, and intergenerational conflict, they do register implicitly, legitimizing Frederick as a tyrannical figure. Conversely, the Forest of Arden is lavishly rendered in vivid colors and populated with flora and fauna. In this way, the visual aspects of the forest become associated with the characters dwelling within it. Again, overarching thematic impressions do not arise from the sets themselves but rather, the sets provide an additional avenue by which characters' actions, words, and consequently, aspects of theme can be expressed. Such visual elements of setting really begin to give rise to theme during characters' interactions, at which points they highlight relevant aspects of speech and action. As the intergenerational conflict plays out, the associations of visual austerity with Frederick and chromatic abundance with the young lovers become clear and embody the thematic impressions of the text. The warm colors of the forest along with speech like the Pages' song, lead to associations between the youthful characters and spring time. Again, this contrasts with the visual austerity of the city which becomes associated with Frederick and winter. The respective portraits of Frederick and Duke Senior provide another example of how visual elements lead to theme. In the context of the production's historical orientation in the 1950's, it is hard to resist a figurative comparison of the colorless portrait of Frederick to a black-and-white television. Similarly, Duke Senior's portrait would signify color television. Historically, as the color television replaces the black-and-white, these images create the impression that Duke Senior (and the characters aligned with him) will replace Frederick. Again, linking this to Hesiod and Frye, the restoration of Duke Senior's power thematically represents the transition from winter to spring, conservativism to liberalism, and the iron age back to the golden age. Finally, the choice to set the play in the 1950's is probably the most significant way the director brought the plays' themes, specifically that of intergenerational conflict, to the forefront. This period in the United States historically is associated with the emergence of what might be operationally referred to as the post-World War Two patriarchy. In this period, social conservativism dominated in a way similar to that of Frederick's rule. Again, applying Frye's comedic model, this conservatism would correspond to the winter season and adulthood. However, by setting the play in this era, it is beholden to a historical trajectory in which the social revolution of the 1960's overturns the established order. Just so, this is the case with the characters dwelling in the Forest of Arden who regain control of the kingdom. Admittedly, it is difficult to make conclusive inferences as to which aspects of the production correspond allegorically to aspects of the historical period, especially considering the fact that Frederick abdicates his rule while in the various counterculture movements of the 1960's more or less seized control. However, period details of the production such as music and costume suggest that both decades were represented. Some of the more austere elements of set design and costuming, specifically those without color or associated with the city, corresponded to the 1950's. Motifs of this decade begin to break down in the forest when color is introduced in ways evocative of 1960's phenomenon such as the proliferation of color television or the mass experimentation with hallucinogenic drugs. In this way, it makes sense to view the inclusion of motifs of both decades in these respective locations and scenes as a way of portraying the transition from one decade to the next. Even Jacques' recitation of his all the world's a stage monologue as a beat poem, the most unambiguously 1950's moment in the Forest of Arden, is still a point of transition as the Beats historically helped pave the way for the dissidents of the 1960's. For these reasons, the pervasive impressions of transition from one decade to the next, conservativism to liberalism, the older generation to the next, and the winter to the spring are ultimately reinforced. Through its choices regarding set design and historical orientation, the production of As You Like It highlights the play's textual themes of seasonal, generational, and historical cycles. By visually contrasting locations, the production reinforces the oppositions represented and dramatized by the characters interacting within them. Color choices strengthen associations between characters and their symbolic representations like seasons, generations, and ages. By incorporating 1950's and 1960's motifs, the intergenerational conflicts of that era thematically parallel such conflicts within the play. By using period-specific details, the production blends these two decades and achieves an impression of transition from one to the next. Ultimately, the production links text to performance and late 16th century England to mid 20th century America, dramatizing the universality of cycles, seasons, degeneration, and restoration.

ENG.G0.48.1,Creative Exercise in Style and Content,English,Critique/Evaluation,"Confronted with the task of comparing two modernist texts for the purpose of seeking a deeper understanding of both novels, I chose How I Found America by Anzia Yezierska and 1919 by John Dos Pasos, hoping that their marked divergence of styles would make for a compelling pair. Their authors write so differently, in fact, I wondered what each of the texts would look like written in the style of the other. Could their plots be translated without contradicting the narratives style? Would common themes emerge or be obscured? Having written Daughters last Character Story in Yezierskas style and Dreams and Dollars in Dos Pasos style, my retrospective observations about the texts and my own act of writing has taught me that the each authors style serves their literary agendas. Yezierskas emotional, deeply internal narration contributes to her characters passions and tenacity to succeed, while Dos Pasos unsentimental, external narration estranges both the reader from the characters and the characters from one another, almost predicting their descent. First, I wrote a part of Daughters last Character Story beginning on page 323 in the style of Yezierska. I selected Daughter because, like Yezierskas characters, shes a young woman in an unfamiliar country, and I was struck by that similarity. Furthermore, I was curious to see if I could render Daughters decision to kill herself and her ultimate death in Yezierskas optimistic tone. ""My heart is broken! Every hope I had is lost and I have nobody in this whole wide world!"" Daughter cried as she lay in bed. Suddenly, through the open window blew the intoxicating scent of the cyclamens, those bright harbingers of love that Daughter had seen that day on the mountain in Rome and she thought of (5) Dick Savage. Dick Savage! How her very small, dark world had opened up the day she met him! The way he spoke French and Italian so fluently, it was as if he were God sent to speak endless tongues on her behalf, to guide her in this strange city. A wave of nausea ravished her and she closed her eyes, sucked down (10)again into that eternal spinning darkness. Why did she always have to feel things so intensely? Dick had held her to his breast, and her heart had beat so quick like the wings of birds as if to drive him back and escape, but she felt herself sink into lust for his kiss. And now their child, burning with the furious intensity of new life and their love, grew within her and Dick did not want it! (15) Daughter moaned and beat her fists against her own weak body. ""Why did I give in?"" she wailed, ""Why did I sacrifice what worldly good this mind could have done for something so base?"" She had wanted to become like Dick, to do something that would help the new world after the war. Again she lifted her head to up and saw the bright sky outside her window. To be a poet like (20) him! To live anywhere, even on the cheapest sort of bread, filling the aching hunger in their souls with the beauty of their words! But how could she tame the passion that choked her without Dick? She needed someone to pull her up from her wretched condition. Someone to support her and help care for their child if she wanted to spend her days at the desk with a (25) pen and not at the washtub with a scrub board, doing laundry to earn her keep. ""Unbearable!"" Daughter shrieked. ""I didnt travel to this country in this time of opportunity, everyone united under the auspices of a new world, to work with my hands!"" Suddenly, there was a knock at her door, and Dick had burst in and taken (30) her in his arms. Could it be? Had her sun and life truly returned? ""Nono! You said you didnt want me!"" Daughter gasped, disturbed by his sudden ardor. ""No, my love,"" Dick said, clasping one of her hands in his and placing his other on her stomach, ""It is I who should be abandoned. I who failed to see the value of that shining future in you!"" One thing that became immediately apparent as I rewrote Daughters story was the impossibility of conveying the actual events of the story. Yezierska stays so closely inside her characters minds and tracks their emotional movements so minutely that even though I only wrote one moment from Daughters story, her psychological flights sustained a plausible narrative without me ever making her leave the bed in her room. Conversely, I suddenly understood why Dos Pasos is able to cover so much plot timebecause the inner feelings of his characters are largely absent. Indeed, the only clues Dos Pasos gives about Daughters feelings are brief and facile. When she finds out shes pregnant, she feels nothing more than scared and her decision to kill herself comes as a complete whim in the bathroom while she lunches with Barrow (Dos Pasos 324, 27). Faced with imaging how Daughter might feel in these instances, it was surprisingly easy to extrapolate her emotions in lines 11-14, especially given the themes that occur so often in Yezierskas work as a basis to build upon, such as a preference for the new and the passionate, and a complex relationship with men and how they can help or hinder women achieve intellectual goals. Nevertheless, I found that these themes didnt seem terribly in conflict with what Daughter might be feeling in Dos Pasos mind. Just as Rebecca is flattered by Moes romantic attention but ultimately disgusted by his lust for material wealth in Dreams and Dollars, (223) Daughter tells Dick making love is magnificent& Oh, I wish I was dead (297) in one single line, expressing a profound ambivalence about losing her virginity. Since most of Dos Pasos female characters come off two-dimensional and fairly powerless, intensifying Daughters feelings through Yezierskas tone made me wonder if her wishing for death wasnt just a way of giving up but an expression of a deeper agency. Other common themes became apparent, such as Yezierskas idealism about America and her lofty treatment of intellectual pursuits. Although lines 26-28 sound strongly of Yezierska, Daughter too has a strong desire to improve conditions in wartime Europe when she tells her family others had given their lives to save the world& and& she& certainly could give up six months to relief work (227). When I read how Daughter believed Dick would be a famous writer (324) it reminded me immediately of Rebeccas admiration for Felix because his poetry filled the room& [with] wonder and beauty (Yezierska 225). Neither Rebecca nor Daughter like poetry for specific reasons other than its being a path to something higher, more ethereal. Most of all, using such explosive, internal language to explore Daughters feelings made them more transparent and insistent in a way that is absent in Dos Pasos. Daughter tells Mr. Barrow she cant get along with the old cats in the N.E.R., but she never explains why or defines what shed rather be doing. For this reason, it made the most sense to me to end Daughters story optimistically. No one ever contemplates suicide or dies in any of the Yezierskas stories we read for class. Even when Shennah Pessah from Wings is crushed by her loneliness (Yezierska 4) she feels the sun on her cheeks and [drinks] in the miracle of the sunlit wall. Nor could I imagine Daughter leading Mr. Barrow on romantically or dancing tightly with a Frenchman shed just met in a bar in Yezierskas literary world (Dos Pasos 324, 3). The fact that Yezierskas style trumped the content of Dos Pasos plot to the point that I felt the ending to Daughters story must be changed points to the enormous power of Yezierskas form and how it serves to benefit her content. Furthermore, it reveals a similar power in Dos Pasos stylethat his characters lack of upfront emotions is part of the reason why their passions and idealism seem to fade away so easily. Next, I wrote the story Dreams and Dollars in the style of Dos Pasos. Knowing from my first exercise how profoundly Yezierskas style dictated the content of Dos Pasos story as I rewrote it, I selected Dreams and Dollars because it presents a situation in which a characters values are put to the test. When Rebecca leaves the squalor of New York tenement living and discovers her sister Minnies lavish life and Moe, a man who will financially support her if Rebecca chooses, she is forced to choose between the moral value of an austere lifestyle, close to her Russian Jewish roots, or a comfortable lifestyle with a higher degree of American assimilation. Would Dos Pasos tendency to distance his characters from their own thoughts and feelings incline Rebecca to fall victim to Minnies decadence? When she got to Los Angeles, Rebecca was very impressed by the richlooking residential houses. She found her sister Minnies house and knocked on the door. Minnie answered. She seemed heavier than Rebecca remembered. ""Its been ten years,"" she cried, taking Rebecca in her arms. Come meet my (5) husband, Abe. Abe was the rich banker Minnie had moved away from New York to marry. ""Finally Ill have some peace,"" he said jovially, ""Minnies been lonely for you ever since I brought her here. Do stay and keep her company; in the meantime, you must meet Moe."" ""Looking like that?"" Minnie broke in, ""Everyone will know she came straight from Delancey street."" Rebecca noticed (10) her sisters hands were covered in diamond rings and she tried to forget her own threadbare jumper. Moe arrived with a box of candy for Rebecca that was more delicious than any she had ever eaten. Dinner was even more lavish, and after she had stuffed herself Moe took her outside and showed her a gleaming red limousine. ""Swellest car on the market. I got it the minute your sister said you (15) were coming."" Rebecca flushed. She knew he was after her and wondered what harm it would do to let him love her a little, but Felix was the only one for her. Moe mustve seen her looking off and he asked, ""What can I do to please you? Let me try a little."" Rebecca thought and said, ""I love music! If only I could afford the opera."" Moe laughed and the slight condescension in his voice (20) made Rebecca scowl. ""The music I like best is composed by the cash register. Just jingling coins in my hands makes me feel more grand than any opera Ive ever heard."" He went on talking about his money and Rebecca thought he was a great dullard. When she walked back in the house her Minnie and Abe were putting out brandies and ashtrays for a card party. Rebecca didnt much care (25) for cards and she though smoking was a dirty habit but Minnie insisted she play. Moe drew a chair close to his and beckoned with a hand. ""Sit near me, Little Queen, Ill teach you the rules."" Minnie and Abes friends came, stuffy people in silk evening dresses and smoking jackets. The kind of money they tossed on the table would have bought Rebecca groceries for weeks. Moe kept (30) pointing at the little red hearts and numbers on his cards but she couldnt make any sense out of it because the smoke in the air made her head feel like a balloon. She asked for a drink of water and Moe brought her a glass of wine that burned her throat. ""I cant do this,"" she said and stood. ""But youre my charm! Ive just won another hundred,"" Moe said, grasping her hand. ""Its not just the (35) money,"" Minnie broke in, ""When I play I get so excited I forget about everything. Theres no pastno futureonly the nowthe life of the game. Please stay."" Minnies eyes were wide and Rebecca felt badly leaving her there. Her only sister. She sat again and really listened when Moe told her what a good hand looked like. When her glass got low someone filled it and she drank until (40) her head throbbed but in a pleasantwarm way like her own heartbeat. Moe had an arm around her shoulders and when he whispered in her ear he would kiss it and chuckle like he had done it by mistake. His breath smelled sour and dark and Rebecca felt herself slump against him, glad that she didnt have to hold herself up any longer. Just as it was impossible for me to rewrite more than just a moment from Daughters story in Yezierskas style because of her deeply internal narration, I was able to compress most of Yezierskas 13-page story in about a page due to the near complete absence of psychological movement. In fact, I felt more like I was summarizing a plot than telling a storysomething that likely indicates my own personal preference for character monologue in my own creative writing. On the other hand, escaping Yezierskas claustrophobic closeness and volatile shifts in emotion felt liberating. I intentionally left the sentiment in line 4 that Minnie seems heavier ambiguous, just as Daughter describes Mr. Barrow with The gap was very wide between his front teeth when he smiled (Dos Pasos 326). Daughter doesnt implicitly state that she likes or dislikes this gap, but we can tell from the way she ultimately treats Mr. Barrow badly that she hold this trait against him. While Dos Pasos runs the risk of being only scenic and not specific in terms of what the characters feel, his objectivity does open up a range of emotions for his characters and also gives the reader more of a chance to form their own opinions instead of being bound so closely, as in Yezierskas case. Nevertheless, as soon as I began to extract myself from Yezierskas characters minds they became more two-dimensional. Although I chose to keep Moes dialogue about the music of cash registers in lines 20-22, I removed his internalization about Rebecca, A sudden pity gripped him. He longed to brighten the lonely look of this little greenhorn, put roses into her pale thin cheeks and Rebeccas internalization about Moe, The light that burned& in the eyes of poets& burned also in the eyes of the traders of her race (Yezierska 224). Knowing that Moe pities Rebeccas hardships and sincerely wishes to show her the pleasures of wealth makes his interest in her seem more than sexual, but a philanthropic and even selfless. Likewise, when Rebecca concedes that Moes passion about making money is the same as a poets passion for writing, she validates him as person with dreams and not just a slave to the dollar. When I removed these things, I realized Moe had the capacity to become a much more sinister character, only concerned with possessing Rebecca sexually. Mr. Barrow undergoes a similar transformation when he tells Daughter, Youre the only girl Ive ever known who seemed really a beautiful pagan at heart and begs her to be with him (Dos Pasos 330). Up until this point, hes taken Daughter out to dinners, had many benign conversations with her, and she even describes him as understanding an kind (326). When he brings up the concept of paganism, however, and kisses Daughter wetly in the ear (330) his former niceties are overshadowed with what seems like a very sexual overture, reducing him to nothing more than an old pervert. Thus, Dos Pasos tendency to simplify his characters makes them less reliable and more prone to disappointing reader expectations on the whole. For all their passion and optimism they are almost set up to fail, and this realization compelled me to let Rebecca flounder in Los Angeles moral degradation. Another reason I selected Dreams and Dollars is the story features a party, an opportunity for Rebeccas state-of-consciousness to be altered in such a way that signals her falling away from the narrative. In lines 43 and 44, I tried to mimic Dos Pasos This time she didnt feel so bad& The spinning sun blinded her as they dropped (Dos Pasos 332, 3). Daughters almost peacefully accepts her own death and the cessation of her sight as shes blinded marks an end to her consciousness, her role as a focalizer in the narration. Recreating this exit, I realized its grace and aptness in a story where characters only ever seem vaguely aware of their role in the world. The violence of the plane crash is never referred to, only a fall made endless by the ceasing of narrative before the point of impact. If I had asked the question in my thesis as to the connection between style and content for Yezierska and Dos Pasos and attempted to answer it using only a close-reading of the texts, I wouldnt have stumbled across revelations nearly as provocative and illuminating as having done this exercise in creative writing. Slipping into the shoes of the writers performed miracles in terms of understanding the literary choices they made and why they might have made them, and pitting these two texts together in this way was a powerful demonstration of the interdependence of form and content in literature. Most surprising to me was despite Yezierska and Dos Pasos entirely different styles and agendas, optimism and pessimism, both texts still shared themes common to modernism. Even in the act of writing I was aware that Id opened up many more valuable avenues for comparison than the limitations of time and this paper allow, but I hope that even this preliminary exploration proves exciting, and that this topic becomes a regular option (even requirement, I daresay) for students in future courses.

ENG.G2.05.1,St. Alban and English Exemplarity,English,Critique/Evaluation,"�For more than 1600 years a Church has stood on the site of St. Albans Abbey, which was once recognised as the premier Abbey of England . . . . but the interest of St. Albans does not consist in its buildings alone. Time was, for instance, when the nation cared nothing for the education of the people, but here in St. Albansat least from the time of Edward the Confessoran educational ladder was in existence by means of which children of the humblest origin might rise, and some of them did rise, to the highest position in Church and State. . . . . Again, from a military point of view, St. Albans from prehistoric times down at least to the Wars of the Roses, seems always to have been considered a place of supreme importance. Examples can be found here of ancient British, Roman, and Mediaeval fortifications. There are recorded visits of almost every English Sovereign from William the Conqueror to Queen Elizabeth. A visit to St. Albans should do something to arouse renewed interest in the Church and State to which we are proud to belong. There are not many towns in the land whose records tell more about the story of the English people. In this passage from a twentieth century guidebook, the abbey of St. Albans is figured as a long-standing bastion of education that has persisted through and has been built up by various empires on English soil. Certainly, we can read the mention of the various sovereigns visits to the Abbey as a pressuring appeal to tourists: Hey, if Queen Elizabeth could make it to the abbey, shouldnt you? But what interests me in this excerpt is the way in which Church, State, St. Albans, and the people are all portioned out as either opposing or allied elements in the history of England. The populace is fully distinct from the nation, [which] cared nothing for the education of the people, but St. Albans has countered such national negligence by educating children even of the humblest origin and pushing them up the social ladder tothe highest position in Church and State. The guidebook looks to St. Albans as the glue that has held the nation togetherin both the past and the present. Such phrases as For more than 1600 years a Church has stood and St. Albans . . . seems always to have been considered a place of supreme importance suggest a historical continuity in the material existence and public perception of the abbey itself. And in the present, a mere visit to the abbey will arouse the peoples renewed interest in the Church and State; the abbey will consolidate all these disparate (and sometimes opposed) elements of England. Ultimately, the site tell[s] more about the story of the English peopleboth past and presentthan any other locale. But because the rhetoric of this passage serves to promote tourism rather than interrogate St. Albans role as a national symbol, some interesting issues and tensions go unacknowledged. If the people have always perceived St. Albans as unifying force in the nation, why do they need to renew their interest by visiting? Does this call for renewal suggest a discontinuity in St. Albans history of representing the Church and State, or is this renewal a sort of performance, a reaffirmation of the sites continued importance for the people and nation? Does the move to assert the primacy of the regionThere are not many [other] towns in the landsupport or destabilize the notion of a larger Church and State unified by St. Albans? And is the church important for its materialityits physical existenceor for the textuality it has engendered, therecords that tell the story of the English people? A variety of texts from different periods have discussed and represented St. Albans Abbey or St. Alban himself, and interestingly enough, these very issueshistorical continuity, performance, regionalism, nationalism, textuality, materiality, etc.tend to reoccur as pivotal sites of critical inquiry. Martyrologies and hagiographic texts, for example, often look to the abbey or its namesake to claim the constancy of the Christian Church and the nation on English soil, despite imperial threats to their perseverance. Thus, several hundred years before the 1936 tour guide, such texts as the South English Legendary (SEL), Lydgates Saint Albon and Saint Amphibalus, and Foxes Acts and Monuments present Alban as Englands first Christian martyr, whose refusal to recant his faith in the face of persecutors results in his martyrdom. Alban thus becomes an exemplar of a devout Christian for the people who learn of his life. But one of the primary questions in each of these texts is, which people is he an exemplar for? Individual practitioners of a Christian faith? A particular region of England? The entire nation of England? A universal, atemporal Christendom? Some sort of true Christendom? Each of these texts negotiates different levels of inclusion regarding the people who are to imitate Alban, so Albans representations are often multivalent and ambiguous. Critics approaching Foxes martyrology are clearly aware of this fact. Thomas Betteridge comments on the constant tension in Foxe between a universal, ahistorical act of martyrdom and the particular, historical record of persecution (148). In Elect Church or Elect Nation?, Glyn Parry notes the ambiguity in Foxes approach to the martyrs of England: He saw England, or at least the gathered flock of the faithful in England, in the context of the universal true church (169). So, the question remains: do the people who read Alban within these texts constitute a nation, a gathered flock, a subset of universal Christians, or all or none of the above? In this paper I will explore these questions by interrogating how people are represented as reading Alban or else are instructed to do so. In other words, I want to look to particular moments of two different sorts: (1) when the people are enacting a particular sort of reading of Albans martyrdom within a text; and (2) when the author makes an explicit reference to read Alban in a certain way. Furthermore, as we saw in the guidebook above, one possible strategy for connecting the people to the nation and Christianity is to have them read the abbey itselfits material existence and its records. Hence, I will also consider the various representations of the abbey in the SEL, Lydgates Albon, and Foxes Acts. While these texts share a common concernthe affirmation of the continuity of a nation of Christians and a more universal Christian community despite imperial and pagan threats and persecutionthey differ markedly in their strategic use and non-use of the people and the abbey to represent and construct such continuity. The possibility of a continuous Christianity appears as a point of debate not only in literary-critical analyses of Alban texts but also in architectural and archaeological studies of the town and abbey of St. Albans. The essays in the recent collection Alban and St Albans: Roman and Medieval Architecture, Art and Archaeology make it clear that the archaeological evidence does not conclusively prove the existence of a single Christian church and community at St. Albans for at least 1600 years, as the tour guide has suggested. In The Origins of St Albans Abbey, Martin Biddle and Birthe Kjolbye-Biddle allow for the possibility of the eventual discovery of a Christian site in continuous use since the 4th century A.D. and a basilica built over Albans grave at some date before the visit of Germanus in 429 (73). But there is no concrete evidence of this continuous Christian site as yet. Instead, what we find around the site of St. Albans is the progressive building and topographic expansion of different churches, chapels, the nave, etc. by Anglo-Saxon, Norman, and later British people, all above the site of a Romano-British cemetery from ca. 400 (45). Thus, the abbey is a sort-of conglomerate of the work of various cultures on the same sitea palimpsest with layers of the Christian work of various cultures on a possibly pagan-influenced (Breton) foundation. Interestingly, questions of materiality and textuality emerge in these essayists discussion of the use of evidence on the Alban site. In Why Verulamium?, Rosalind Niblett looks for evidence of Christianity in the region of St. Albans (under the Roman name Verulamium) to explain the sharp decline in the Oysterfield/Folly Lane cult center nearby, which employed the pagan practices of local hero worship. She finds that there are no portable items with Christian symbols to prove the existence of a Christian community here but notes that three buildings in the region shows signs of conversion from a temple to a church (6). Thus, the churches themselves become the material proof of Christian continuity and triumph over competing religious practice in the fifth to eighth centuries.1 Martin Henig echoes this lack of Christian evidence at the site of Verulamium and contends that artifacts like a Christian signet ring have been discovered, but at a considerable distance from the region (Religion and Art in St Albans City 26-7). He finds this lack of material evidence embarrassing due to the general presumption of continuity on the site. Ultimately, he seems to locate this presumption of continuity in the reader-response to hagiographic texts, which we must approach as a matter of faith and fine judgement. Perhaps not too surprisingly, these scholars of architecture and archaeology look to such material evidence as artifacts and the vestiges of physical structures to prove the idea of historical continuity. Hagiography is thus rendered as a textually constructed (and dismissable) representation of historical continuity, though one can argue that the architectural argument is also a constructed idea based on a belief in material, rather than verbal, evidence. But how exactly does the SELa hagiographic collection of saints lives from the thirteenth and fourteenth centuriesconstruct continuity in the case of Albans life? What sorts of textual strategies are employed to suggest continuity and what, exactly, is supposed to be continuous? As I mentioned at the outset, to approach such questions I will look to representations of the people and the abbey to emphasize the various possible levels of inclusion for those who are to read and imitate Alban. But considering the opposition of architectural/material versus literary/textual set out by the essayists above, we should also contemplate the potential role of materiality in the textual representations of the people and the abbey. In its first two lines, the Alban section of the SEL ties Albon immediately to England, fronting the nation before the martyrdom itself: Seint Albon the holyman her of Engelonde / Imartred he was for Godes loue . . . (1-2, p. 238). Reiterating Albons function as a figure for both the nation and a larger Christianity, the poet even encapsulates the two into the rhyme of a couplet: A Iustice that with hom was to Engelonde com / To martri alle Cristenemen and destruie Cristendom (9-10). Thus, Christianity is harmonized, even equated, with the nation itself, a move that in some ways resembles the overt tying of English Church and State in the tourist info book from the 1930s. Of course, in the case of the SEL the integrity of Christianity and the nation is threatened by a Justice who speaks French; this man is represented as an invader into England whose first words are Bel ami (29). He would most likely be read in the Middle Ages as a Norman persecutor on English soil. On one hand, then, Englishness is defined in opposition to the Norman practice and culture of a medieval present (i.e., from a medieval audiences perspective). But Englishness is also defined against the hethene practice associated most ominously with the luther prince[s] Dioclisian and Maximian (3, 5-6). The text does not emphasize that these are Roman emperors from the past. This elision, coupled with the presence of a Norman Judge, blurs the line between past and present: while this portion of the narrative is in the past tense, the historical Roman figures are placed into the same time and place as a daunting figure from the post-invasion present. Continuity here is thus established through a mixing of similar persecuting figures from different times into the same imagined time and space, rather than a clear portioning out and paralleling of past and present persecutions. Nevertheless, while the poet suggests to medieval readers the link between Englishness and a larger Christianity against foreign invaders of different (but ultimately the same) sorts, he allows only a little space for the people represented in the text to enact a reading of Alban. A crowd of people witness Albans miracles, including his splitting of the water and the appearance of a spring on dry rock. But the only attention given to their reading of his miracles is one mans giving up his sword to praise Alban and ask for Gods mercy. As Alban is killed, the people fade out of the narrative. However, in the closing lines the poet brings the tale into the present tense to mention Albans legacy: there is nou a chirche arered beside the town of Wincester, near the spot of Albans death (l. 95). The reader is instructed to note the greatness of the Abbey and to ask Jesus and Saint Albon for a joy that euere ssel ilaste; but this dangling clause may also modify the Abbey itself, suggesting its own endurance. Much like the tourist piece, this text encourages the reader to interpret the persistence of Alban though his cathedral as a symbol of the endurance of an English and Christian nation. Thus, at the poems end the SEL Alban poet represents the continuity of Christianity on English soil in the material persistence of the Abbey itself rather than the physical presence of Albans followers. This is of course a textual representation of materiality, but not a textuality divorced from material concerns as suggested by the architectural critics above. Hence, the poetics of the conclusion serve as a sort of textual-materialitya more subtle reinforcement of the continuity of the English nation via St. Albans. As set up by the initial rhyming of Engelonde com and Cristendom at the poems beginning, some of the final lines of the poemwhich describe the everlasting abbey rhyme the following: understonde, fonde, Engelonde, and understonde. By writing England into the rhyme scheme of the poem, which progresses continuously in couplets, the poet builds a poetic architecture that hints at Englands role in a perpetually harmonious structure. Furthermore, each of these rhymes (and most throughout the poem) are native, Germanic words. This fact is particularly interesting since rhyming couplets were themselves a borrowing from Norman and Continental poetic practices.2 It is as if the poet has nativized and nationalized this poetic form, writing out the Norman qualities to re-emphasize Alban as a symbol for the continuity of an English nation despite the conquest. The poem thus exhibits a textual-materiality: by building Christianity and England into the poetic form, we can observe (as readers) and hear (as listeners) these as fundamental elements of an unvarying, overall structure.3 While this structural continuity reinforces the perpetuity of the abbey, the English nation, and Christianity, we should also note that the people who read Alban in the SEL are primarily outside the text rather than represented within it. That is, it is mainly the texts audience who should take in the harmonious poetic effects and recognize the perpetuity of the Christian nation through the abbey of Alban. Nevertheless, when we move to Lydgates Alban, we find that the representations of the people and the abbey, and even the conception of continuity, are markedly different. Out of the three texts I will analyze in this paper, Lydgate provides the most elaborated version of Saint Albons life. Saint Albon and Saint Amphibalus attempts to tie English national identity to the Christianization of peoples on the isles. Lydgate pushes this connection primarily through the character of Albon, who, after abandoning his allegiances to Roman deities, becomes the first Christian martyr on the island. Albon is portrayed as a mostly stable figure4 geographically tied to the land and God; al hol he keeps his ground and place (2.1081) and remains Groundid in God (2.1725) when his faith is tested. Even in his miracles he is intimately linked to the English land itself, praying to God to cure the excesses of natureflood or droughtand restore the land. Albon becomes an edifice for the endurance of Christianity since its arrival in Romanized Britain, and Lydgate more overtly addresses Albons post-mortem edification as he succinctly describes King Offas subsequent building of St. Albans monastery (1.642+). But unlike the SEL poet, Lydgate foregrounds various peoples response to Albans martyrdom on English soil and contains the discussion of the abbey in a short passage. Since Lydgate emphasizes the people in this text, I will first analyze their role in establishing continuity and then move on to discuss the impact of the passage about Offa and the abbey. In Lydgates Albon, the critical feature of his construction of a continuous English Christianity is his narrative attempt to consolidate Britains Roman/pagan past and national Christian present. Like the SEL, the audience is called upon to recognize this consolidation in their reading of Albans life and martyrdom. But instead of locating the people primarily in this audience, Lydgate incorporates numerous instances in which the people in the text observe and enact various readings of Albons suffering, miracles, and martyrdom. This inclusion of the people adds another dimension to our study: how do the performative qualities of the peoples reactions to and imitations of Alban help constitute a specific conception of nationhood? To better understand the term performative and its connections to the idea of nationhood, we should consider the work of Homi Bhabha. In DissemiNation, Bhabha distinguishes the pedagogical articulation of nationhood, which represents the people as an a priori historical presence, from the performative, in which the people are constructed as repeating or iterating actions that may subvert, reauthorize, or supplement some concept of the nation (147). Whereas the pedagogical model would hold that historical continuity is the result of a necessary, sequential progression of events, the performative might hold that continuity is the set of all iterated cultural practices that people happen to enact because of social conditions and/or individual agency. Thus, the performative construction of nation allows a space for those who are marginalized to reconstruct the nation as a non-homogenizing, more porous entity. If we try to examine the construction of nationhood in these terms in Saint Albon and Saint Amphilbalus, we discover that the text is somewhat conflicted about its pedagogical and performative approaches to the nation. Book 1 begins with a mostly uncritical look at the integrity of the Roman empire and the emperors concern for the common profit of all its diverse lands. The emperor even develops a chivalric code, draws in representatives from the various regions, and sends them back out as steward-knights to protect the people and uphold good virtues and Roman law. Here Lydgate establishes continuity with the Roman/pagan past by establishing the models of good government and chivalric practice as Roman cultural practices that Christianity would adopt, extend, and improve upon by re-orienting them towards God. Alban is a key figure here, for even the pre-Christian Albon protected his people and practiced righteously. But his devotional orientation was askew, just waiting to be re-oriented in his eventual imitation of Amphibalus. Following this unification of regional variation and totalization of the people of Roman the empire, Book 2 turns the focus away from any mention of regions towards the private conversion and religious practice of Albon in England. The text emphasizes the performativity of Albons indoctrination: Amphibal is rehersyng the doctrine of the Trinity to Albon, who in turn rehersid in sentence . . . These words but ultimately reperforms them as a personal repentance for his mysdede (2.710-7). This individuated reiteration of the Christian faith, coupled with the lack of reference to region or nation in this section of the book, advertises a private connection to a more universal Christian faith and practice. Here Albon is a sort of everymanperhaps one of the peopleand any reader could imitate his private actions by reiterating the words on the page. Even so, when Albon publicly martyred, Lydgate shifts the focus on the readers imitation of Albans private practice to the interest of people from all sorts of regions and cities in Britain. As they appear in undifferentiated throngs to watch his suffering, the people are again super-regionally totalized within the bounds of the nation. The end of Book 2 provides contradictory representations of the people and Albon as either parts or the whole of the nation. On one hand, the people are all of oo sentence, / And with oo vois in their disdain of the judgethey are absolutely homogenized though positioned against state authority (2.1980-1). On the other hand, in their initial reaction to the healing miracles of Albon there was gret contraversie; this lack of a general consensus among the people establishes a space for more differentiable voices or identities among them (1962). And curiously, when performing the Latin laud to Albon, each partie enacted it for a syngular comendacioun / Of hym . . . / Stiward of Bretonys (2026-2030). The word syngular nicely emphasizes the doubleness of this performance: to support Albon as a representative of the nation, each person performs a song with the same set of words, but each performance is a unique praise of the saint. These individuated reiterations of a standard laud bolster the conception of a nation of Bretonys through the figure of Albonmost clearly reinforced by the light that shoots from his hometown into the sky so that the people of alle four parties strecchying of Bretyn can see it (2010). But Lydgate undercuts this national totalization in the Books final lines by reaffirming the centrality of Albons home region: Albon is to that cite supportour and patroun (2046). In a sense, we can locate performativity in Lydgate himself, who reiterates Albon as a shifting center in different contextsfrom a private practitioner of a universal Christianity, to a symbol of national unity, to the protector of a local district. The people, then, are reiterated as wellsometimes totalized, sometimes individuated, sometimes both totalized and individuated, but almost always directed towards or away from Albon as a center. On one hand, we can read the sheer variety of formations of the people as various discontinuities in behavior and practice on English soil that are eventually brought to cohere by Albans martyrdom. But this more progressive, pedagogical reading is undercut by the possibility of singular practice, since Lydgate opens up some space for individual people to perform unique acts of worship and witness of Albons legacy. Thus, continuity is established through peoples individual imitations of Alban as an exemplaravailable to the Bretons in the past (the people in the text) and to the audiences in the present and future (those readers and listeners outside the text). Despite the primacy of the people in the construction of a continuous English and universal Christianity in this text, Lydgate makes mention of the monastery built by Kyng Offa, who bar the cost, of gret devocioun (Book 1, ll. 642-665). This extremely brief story appears as a sudden digression in the middle of a discussion of Albans chivalric prowess, presumably to support the idea that Albans name was worthi to be put in memorie (631). But why invoke King Offa, a Mercian king from Old English times? In Offa, Aelfric, and the Refoundation of St Albans, Julia Crick argues that there was a long-standing tradition in Bede and other texts which claimed that Offa had sponsored the building of St. Albans. There were, for instance, several Offa-charters that supposedly bore his signature. Even though these are all likely forgeries, various authorities firmly believed in the storys veracity. But even more intriguing is the fact that these Offa-charters suggested that the monastery needed mediation by the king when it made various important decisions, such as choosing a new abbot. Post-conquest charters often stuck closely to the Benedictine Rule, which emphasized that such decisions were to be made by the community itself rather than an outside source. Consequently, some texts that wanted to support the autonomy of the monastery and the region would edit out this Offa tale as apocryphal. But why would Lydgate include this Offa story in such a late medieval text (in the fifteenth century and later)? Perhaps he invokes it to capitalize on the storys resonance as a tale that de-emphasizes the autonomy of the region/monastery and heightens its connections to larger structuresthe English king and a larger Christendom. The text supports this idea, since Offa is described as a notable gouernour who was known thorugh many regioun (647-9).5 Furthermore, Lydgate once again links two different cultures, the Romano-Breton and the Anglo-Saxon, but this time through the abbey itself. Thus, Albans uniting of regions prefigures and perhaps predicts Offas eventual supra-regional renown and his building of the abbey to symbolize Albans continued importance for Christians everywhere and at every time, even for the Lydgates contemporary audience. Nevertheless, the supposed persistence of the abbey was eventually undercut during the 1534 printing of this text. James Clark notes that There was a growing perception in the community that the abbeys status as an exempt house of premier rank was under greater threat than ever before. Its share of royal patronage had diminished . . . (The St Albans Monks and the Cult of St Alban 227). To help raise the profile of the abbey as a centre of political and spiritual importance, the monks printed Lydgates text (with some changes, such as a direct appeal to the monarchs) with their own abbey press (226-7). On the eve of the dissolution of the monasteries, the Offa passage may in fact have been read as an impassioned plea to the people of the community and the king himself to recognize the monasterys role in reaffirming the continuity and stability of Christianity in England. Or else it may have been read as a reluctant acceptance of the abbeys inevitable but unfortunate demise. In this case, the monks may be disseminating Lydgates life of Alban as a necessary substitute for the waning abbey itselfa textual representation of a continuous individual, regional, English, and universal Christianity that replaces the material symbol of these notions. The 1534 printing was thus a last-ditch effort by the monastery to use textuality to unite the people around Alban again, encouraging them to read and imitate his life, to reperform Albans and the peoples performances, each in a singular but ultimately universal way. Some interesting questions arise when we move from Lydgate to Foxes Alban. We should keep in mind (at least) two important points about Foxes work: (1) Foxe may have consulted Lydgates version as a source for his own work; and (2) Foxe was staunchly Protestant and critical of many Catholic practices, including the belief in saints and miracles. Thus, if Lydgate inscribes the people primarily as readers of Albans miracles, and if Foxe consciously omits the miracles from his discussions of the martyrs, what happens to the people in Foxes text? Does the institution of St. Albans come into Foxe as another way to read Alban, or is it, too, written out due to its monkishness? How then does Foxe use the Alban story to construct an idea of the continuity of a universal, true Christian church, especially if this church was primarily Catholic for numerous centuries? Foxe overtly dismisses the miracles of Alban, such as his drying up of the river, because they seeme more legend like then truth like (115). Hence, with the omission of these miracles, the peoplethe witnesses of Albans suffering and martyrdomare written out of Foxes account. They are not even given an opportunity to enact a reading of Alban in a particularized or homogenized way. I write omission of the miracles, but ironically, by listing examples of what he will omit in an occupatio, Foxe ends up listing the miracles for his reader, though with minimal or no elaboration. Instead of representing the peoples readings of the martyr, Foxe puts forth his own reading. He opens a space for the reader to interpret the miracles as he sees fit, but Foxes reading will of course put pressure on such supposedly free reading: because I see no great profit nor necessity in the relation thereof [the relevance of the miracles], I leave them to the free judgement of the reader, to thinke of them as cause shall move him (115). This is an interesting moment of locating the people outside the story, admitting yet constraining their free will as readers of Alban. Unlike the implicit location of the people outside the SEL, this indirect address to the reader in the third person admits a certain flexibility in the individual reception of Alban as a textual entity. But at the same time, the rhetorical move reveals a certain uneasiness on Foxes part in rewriting and challenging the story of a national saint. In some ways the institution of St. Albans is also written out of the tale. In this passage, Foxe mentions it only to question its library as a source for a supposedly native tale that he finds dubious. At the same time, though, he concludes this portion by reminding the reader that during Albans time under the tenth persecution, all christianitie almost in the whole Iland was destroyed, the churches subverted, all bookes of the scripture burned (115). Unlike the SEL, he makes no mention here of the permanence of St. Albans despite such threats, perhaps because by this time the monasteries had been dissolved and St. Albans had been seized by the Crown. He does not offer the monastery as another way for the people to read Alban. An interesting historical tidbit to note is that the Abbey Church was actually bought back from the Crown by the townspeople living near the Church in 1550 (Alban Guide 8). The people played a part in reclaiming the Church for their own region (as their Parish Church). Whether or not Foxe were aware of this fact, he chose not to represent the church as a figure of Albans constancy for the people. Perhaps Foxe omits the abbey and the peoples reclamation because of the possibility of his readers over-attachment to St. Albans architectural grandeur rather than God and scripture. Or more simply, he may prefer to invoke Alban as a text rather than as the material instantiation of the monastery to distinguish a true Christianityin the example of Albans martyrdomfrom a false or misguided onethe monastery. In the preceding paragraphs, I have detailed the absences, omissions, and pseudo-omissions of Foxes Alban story. While some of these absences are acknowledged by Foxe himself, we see others only by comparison to the particular presences of the people and the monastery in previous Alban stories. But are the people totally absent from Foxe? Does he give any indication of how Alban the martyr is to be read by the people outside the storythe reader or reading public? As I mentioned above, Foxes Alban story is embedded in his discussion of the tenth persecution of the early Christian Church under the emperor Diocletian of the Roman empire. Unlike Lydgates chivalrous, well-governed, yet pagan Roman empire, Foxes is far more fragmented: there were divers warres that rose in many prouinces (100). We can certainly see here what Michael Pucci identifies as the Roman tyrannythe parallel between the bad governing of popes and Roman emperors (36). But it is important to note that Foxes Roman empire is not corrupt at its corebefore Diocletian tried to exterminate Christians and make his subjects worship him as a god, the empire was quietly and moderately . . . governed to the benefit of Christians everywhere (100). In the Church and the empire, it is particular individuals who corrupt the true system. In Foxe, the peop"
ENG.G3.03.1,Into the Light: Avedon's Images of Inmates,English,Critique/Evaluation,"It is necessary, while in darkness, to know that there is a light somewhere, to know that in oneself, waiting to be found, there is a light. --James Baldwin, Nothing Personal Photographer Richard Avedon is probably most widely known for his fashion photography and portraits of famous people. An Avedon portrait is easily identifiable by its stark white background and the feeling one gets when viewing the image that Avedon has caught the subject in a fleeting moment of letting down her guard. Because Avedons work is so commonly associated with fashion, celebrity, and this trademark aesthetic, viewing his grainy, reportage-style photographs of inmates taken in 1963 at the East Louisiana State Mental Hospital can be a jarring experience. Not only does the subject matter veer from Avedons traditional area of interest, the look of the photos also drastically diverges from the high contrast, bold photographs that are so characteristic of Avedons major body of work. Avedon authorized the publication of these photographs of mental patients in very few printed works. The most prominent of these is Nothing Personal, a Civil Rights era photo-text Avedon created in collaboration with James Baldwin. It is largely in the context of this publication that I will analyze these anomalous images of inmates. My primary interest in these photographs revolves around questions of intention and effect. Photographer Diane Arbus offers one perspective in this arena: Everybody has that thing where they need to look one way but they come out looking another way, and that's what people observe. You see someone in the street, and essentially what you notice about them is the flaw. It's just extraordinary that we should have been given these peculiarities. And, not content with what we were given, we create a whole other set. Our whole guise is like giving a sign to the world to think of us in a certain way but there's a point between what you want people to know about you and what you can't help people knowing about you. And that has to do with what I've always called the gap between intention and effect. (Aperture Monograph) This is certainly one formulation of the gap between intention and effect that could be discussed in terms of Avedons photographs, particularly those of famous people1. One could also view this gap in terms of the artists subjectivity rather than that of the person being photographed, and examine the gap between what the author intended to do when snapping the photograph and what, from the artists perspective, actually resulted. But the most relevant intention and effect framework for analyzing this particular selection of Avedon photographs takes into account the positions of the photographer, the subject, and the spectator/viewer. This investigation aims to examine the intention of the artist, here Avedon, in embarking on a photographic project, this collection of inmate images, and the effect the resulting collection has on the position of the subject and the response of the viewer. This inquiry leads to larger questions about what Susan Sontag calls the ethics of seeing that photographs produce, or the shift in our understanding of what is worth looking at and what we have the right to observe (On Photography 3). Gaining a greater understanding of the relationship between the intentions behind and effects of Avedons 1963 photographs of mental patients will help address the issue of when is it ethically justifiable to capture and share images of vulnerable people. I want to begin with a broad claim: the intention behind Avedons photographs of mental patients is unclear. A closer look at one of the images supports this claim. One of the first images in this section is a two-page spread of some of the patients in the interior spaces of the building (see http://www.richardavedon.com/#s=9&a=2&mi=2&pt=1&pi=10000&p=5&at=0). The most striking aspect of the photo is the unfaltering, piercing gaze of the patient who sits on the floor at the lower right side of the image. There are other patients in the photo, in various recumbent and active states, but this particular individual stands out because he appears to be looking directly at the photographer, conscious of and engaging with the photographers project. Because these photographs are taken outside of the carefully composed confines of Avedons studio, and have the movement and narrative quality of documentary photographs, the moments when the subjects make a visual connection with the camera elicit shock2. The strong gazes of the subjects, the connection they make with the viewer, forces us to remember that they are more than mere objects that have been captured by the push of a button on a photographic apparatus. The people in these photographs are suffering, may or may not have the capacity to give consent to have their pictures taken, and probably have not been informed about what will happen with these photographs once they leave the artists hands. Why did Avedon choose to display these particular photographs in which inmates consciousness about the act of photographing comes into question? Is this an invasive practice, or one of gathering information about a group that has been historically mistreated? One can see that looking at the photos leads to difficulty in understanding artistic intent. Thus, I start with this premise that Avedons intention is unclear, and acknowledge the impossibility of pinning down a singular notion of purpose. I aim to speculate based on the information at hand (by closely reading the photos themselves, examining the contexts of production, and sorting through biographical materials about and interviews by Avedon, for example), and in that speculation, to uncover ways of thinking about how an ethics of seeing is presented by the medium of photography. The next important question is: What are these images? They are featured on Avedons website under the heading of Reportage (See http://www.richardavedon.com/#s=0&a=2&mi=2&pt=1&pi=10000&p=5&at=0). There is certainly a strong journalistic element present in these images. They capture movement and interaction instead of being posed like studio portraits, and the series portrays a narrative about the lives of these individuals in the institution. It is certainly a temptation to place them neatly in this category. But further investigation shows that these images, and the ways they are contextualized in Nothing Personal, draw on a number of traditions. It is important to consider the political significance these images take on due to the nature of the book. Baldwins politically charged text is a harsh criticism of American culture at the hands of consumerism and imbalances in power. He observes, Everyone is rushing, God knows where, and everyone is looking for God knows whatbut it is clear that no one is happy here, and that something has been lost (Nothing Personal, Section 1). Baldwin finds Americans to be loveless, hopeless individuals, incapable of making meaningful connections with each other and of finding value in anything other than material objects. He writes: The utility of the poor white was to make slavery both profitable and safe, and, therefore, the germ of white supremacy which he brought with him from Europe was made hideously to flourish in the American air. Two world wars and a world-wide depression have failed to reveal to this poor man that he has far more in common with the ex-slaves whom he fears than he has with the masters who oppress them both for profit.(Nothing Personal, Section 1). Baldwin draws on history to show how stunted American progress has been and to attempt to locate the source of this cultural malaise and emptiness. Baldwins prose accompanies Avedons photographs of the mental institution and of such figures as the Generals of the Daughters of the American Revolution (see http://www.fraenkelgallery.com/index.php#mi=2&pt=1&pi=10000&s=30&a=3&p=0&at=1), ex-slave William Casby (see http://www.richardavedon.com/#s=0&a=2&mi=2&pt=1&pi=10000&p=4&at=0), politician George Wallace (see http://www.richardavedon.com/#s=8&a=2&mi=2&pt=1&pi=10000&p=4&at=0), and former U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower (see http://www.fraenkelgallery.com/index.php#mi=2&pt=1&pi=10000&s=26&a=3&p=0&at=1). In keeping with the idea of political witnessing that Baldwin establishes with the text, Avedon presents images of a range of individuals in his images. He has selected a cross-section of Americans that inspire the reader to think about issues or power, domination, and social and economic mobility. The images of inmates of East Louisiana State Mental Hospital particularly cue the reader to think about what it means to be forced to live in the margins, on the periphery of what is considered normal. Placing all of these disparate images together in one bound volume suggests a sort of equivalency3 between the subjects that are being displayed. This work that the artists ask viewers to do, to connect the dots between such varying personages as George Lincoln Rockwell (see http://www.richardavedon.com/#s=8&a=2&mi=2&pt=1&pi=10000&p=4&at=0) and Malcolm X (see http://www.richardavedon.com/#s=4&a=2&mi=2&pt=1&pi=10000&p=4&at=0), and to examine the consequences of such alignments, adds a significant visual layer to the political agenda of the book. The result is a collection of photos that challenges viewers to reconsider their preconceptions of both public and private figures (Miller 177). These deeply political themes and images weigh heavily in the attempt to categorize Nothing Personal. In an essay that locates Nothing Personal within a history of books that contain photographic images, Joshua Miller remarks upon the connection between Nothing Personal and the genres of both documentary-based social activist literature, epitomized by such works as Jacob Riis How the Other Half Lives (1890), and an emerging African American tradition of photo-text narratives, an prominent example of which is Richard Wrights 1941 book 12 Million Black Voices (155). But even though he sees the linkage between Nothing Personal and these hybrid classifications, Miller finds that the book still resists falling cleanly into the categories that he carefully defines, just as the photos of the mental institution cannot simply be summarized as reportage. We can at the very least see how Nothing Personal is more of a photo-text than a purely photojournalistic piece because [u]nlike journalismwhich strives to create out of photography the category of objective evidence, the images and texts in this genre often exist in a productive form of dissonance, each calling the other into question (Miller 156). But Nothing Personal moves one step beyond this convention of photo-texts in the way that Baldwins words never speak directly to Avedons images. For example, Baldwin writes of slavery in the piece from Section 1 that is excerpted above, and again in Section 4 of Nothing Personal, but the photo that is the most directly relevant to those selections, the photo of William Casby, appears in Section 2, nowhere near Baldwins appeals about the residual effects of slavery. Baldwins narrative simply runs alongside the photographs, asking readers to make connections that are nowhere explicit in the book. Miller claims that Avedon and Baldwin seek to unhouse the photo-text work from the confines of documentary evidence and that Baldwin avoids [the] metaphor of bringing light to the darkness, making visible that which has been invisible (182). While it is certainly true that Nothing Personal is in no way a text that presents a single, unitary purpose that the photographs can be seen to uphold (Miller 182), there is, at least with respect to these images of inmates in a mental institution, a sense that these individuals live in the margins of society, and that bringing them into the light might in some way attract reformers. Nothing Personal certainly goes further than a text like How the Other Half Lives in the intellectual work that it demands of its readers, the challenge to look at images of both public and private individuals that only seem related to the text because they are bound together in a single volume. But one does get the impression that the artists want to call its reader to action just as Riis did in his work because the book contains such images of dreadful living conditions and explores the ills of society. We have seen the struggle to define Avedon and Baldwins generic intent. Similarly, it is difficult to know (particularly in light of the title of the book) how much of Avedons personal history to consider when trying to ascertain his purpose for taking the photos at East Louisiana State Mental Hospital. It seems imperative to note Avedons personal connection to mental illness and the mental institution. Avedons sister, Louise, struggled with schizophrenia and was institutionalized for many years. She died quite young at the age of 42. In the documentary Richard Avedon: Darkness and Light, Avedon remarks that his sister was his first muse, and that he searched for her in the photographs he took throughout his career. In an interview published in 1985 in the magazine Egoiste, he said: Louise's beauty was the event of our family and the destruction of her life. She was very, very beautiful. She was treated as if there was no one inside her perfect skin, as if she was simply her long throat, her deep brown eyes . . . All my first models - Dorian Leigh, Elise Daniels, Carmen, Marella Agnelli, Audrey Hepburn - were brunettes and had fine noses, long throats, oval faces. They were all memories of my sister. (http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1473132/Richard-Avedon.html?pageNum=1) Does this biographical information change the way we view and analyze this series of photos? In this context, they can be viewed as a memorial to his sister. Knowing that this type of institutional space was most likely familiar territory to Avedon makes him less of an outsider looking in, though it must be acknowledged that he was never himself institutionalized, only a visitor. I also wonder why Avedon chose to take photos of these strangers in an institution rather than photograph his sister during her period of institutionalization? It is clear from his testimonies about his sister that his relationship with her was integral to his photographic process, yet years after her death we see these nameless individuals standing in for her, representing her suffering and displacement from mainstream society. So, we can look at these photos as high art, documentary, memorial, political, socially activist, and even in another manner: as a personal journey for Avedon to face his fears and difficulties. His sisters illness was haunting to Avedon, and his investment in artistic expression was most likely a way of confronting these anxieties. This information about Avedons life is nowhere written on or around the photographs of inmates. One can only discover this by doing some digging or speaking with someone who knew Avedon personally. Does Avedons intentional withholding of this biographical information and context change our potential understanding of these photos as a memorial to his sister and political testimony about similarly situated individuals? This raises interesting issues about the role of captioning in photography. In Nothing Personal, the only caption addressing this series of images is Patients in a mental institution, written on the first page. The only other textual markers are Baldwins writings, and it has already been discussed how the photos and text were never intended to have a direct conversation with each other in this book. Returning to the question of genre, viewers/readers come to expect captions and descriptors in documentary work. This type of information signals to the reader that the photographer intended to gather information about a group or event in order to communicate this information to interested readers. For example, in the book Too Much Time, photographer Jane Evelyn Atwood combines images of female prisoners with extensive textual accounts of the experiences of inmates, wardens, and Atwood herself in the prison facilities. This framing suggests that Atwood pursued her project with the aim of showing people who are outside of the prison system the horrible conditions that those living in it must endure. The text and captions in Too Much Time tell the reader what she cannot see, and call attention to and reiterate what she can see. Many theorizers of photography have observed the way that captions have been used to direct the viewer to some understanding of the photograph. For example, Eduardo Cadava writes, legends become necessary to mark the way and to bridge an image with its meaning (19). Similarly, in Martha Sandweiss analysis of photos of westward expansion, she concedes the power of photography to communicate information, but emphasizes the difficulty photographs have in conveying information without words. Walter Benjamin explains that while photographs challenge people in novel ways, captions act as instruments to reign in the way readers interpret images: picture magazines begin to put up signposts for [the reader], right ones or wrong ones, no matter. For the first time, captions have become obligatory (226). So, while captions can provide a roadmap to show the direction in which the artist/author is headed, they can also dilute the power of the photo to challenge viewers by substituting a superficial reading of the image for the readers own contemplation of the photograph. Thus, on the one hand, the lack of captioning in Avedons images of mental patients leaves much to wonder about his intention. The choice to use only one very sparse caption to describe this entire series of images in Nothing Personal communicates to the reader that these individuals should be viewed as a group. One consequence to this is the possibility of gaining an understanding of the difficulties faced by members of this group. There is however, a risk: A portrait that declines to name its subject becomes complicit&in the cult of celebrity that has fueled an insatiable appetite for the opposite sort of portrait: to grant only the famous their names demotes the rest to representative instances of their occupations, their ethnicities, their plights (Sontag, Regarding, 79). This lack of identification may lead to generalization that greater stigmatizes mental patients and ignores the real and particular problems faced every day on an individual level. This is one potential way to read the work that captions do in these images. On the other hand, in line with Benjamins thoughts on the role of captions, omitting labels may allow spectators to enter into a dialogue with the image in any way they choose. Instead of being guided down a path by the authors singular perspective, the reader is given room for contemplation. An additional problem does arise, however, when pairing the minimal captioning with Avedons reputation as an art photographer. By not including extensive factual information about the individuals in the photos, Avedon cues readers away from the conventions of photojournalism. This raises anxiety about whether Avedons aim is to gain information about a population in the hopes of reform, a trajectory more commonly associated with a journalistic agenda, or to make a mark on the art market, which falls more in line with how Avedons work has been traditionally defined. Equivalency again becomes an issue, but this time in the broader context of looking at these particular Avedon photographs of the mentally ill in relation to his larger body of work that is primarily comprised of fine art photographs. Perhaps Avedon is drawing a connection between images of mental patients and those of famous people in the manner that Allan Sekula observes a linkage between honorific and repressive photos of the nineteenth century.4 By publishing this range of photos in one volume and thus signaling that they are on a plane of equivalency, readers engage in the activity of looking at them alongside each other and, for example, comparing the image of Marilyn Monroe (see http://www.richardavedon.com/#s=0&a=0&mi=1&pt=0&pi=3&p=-1&at=-1) with that of a nameless woman clutching a baby doll (see http://www.richardavedon.com/#s=5&a=2&mi=2&pt=1&pi=10000&p=5&at=0). Are we then looking for markers on the bodies of the mentally ill that distinguish them from the public personages? Are we becoming police who can articulate and diagnose markers of madness by looking at photographed bodies? Or perhaps these comparisons have a democratizing effect, and Avedons image of the flawless celebrity now flawed demonstrates that there is not much difference between those who are revered and those who are forced to the outermost edges of society. If we can view Avedons hopeful end result for this particular project as one of reform and unification, is there still a cost to these potentially objectified inmates? I want to refrain from engaging in a lengthy discussion about possible ways to quantify the worth of such a project as this is just as futile as trying to identify a singular, unified artistic intent for the project of capturing these images, but it is worth noting that Nothing Personal was never reprinted after its initial run. This may be due to the significant negative criticism that the book received, most notably in the scathing review written by prominent theatre critic Robert Brustein. Regardless, one thing that can be surmised with a fair amount of confidence is that Baldwin and Avedon wanted this publication to spread far and wide in the hands of both those complicit in the dominant power structures the artists are critiquing and to those in crisis as a result of inequality. And although it is notable that the conditions of those institutionalized due to mental illness in this country have improved since 1964, those improvements came about gradually and not as a direct cause of this book. This essay draws artificial boundaries between the artistic intention of photographs and their effects on the subject and viewer, but of course in discussing artistic intention, we have already entered the territory of exploring the effects of these images and possible gaps between intention and effect. Let us take heed of Sontags claim: The photographers intentions do not determine the meaning of the photograph which will have its own career (39). Looking at these effects in an isolated fashion will be instructive in gaining a greater understanding of the ethics of seeing presented in these photographs. One possible effect of the production and publication of the photographs of mental patients on the patients themselves is that they have become objectified. Sontag invites us to remember the unique quality of photographs: these realistic stills, unlike moments in film or television, are objects, they are images we can hold, carry, and collect (On Photography 3). She continues, To photograph is to appropriate the thing photographed. It means putting oneself into a certain relation to the world that feels like knowledgeand therefore, like power (On Photography 4). This power differential inherent in the relationship between the photographer and the person being photographed is especially troubling when the subjects are mentally ill people who have been committed to institutions. As consumers of these images we are complicit in this power differential, turning our objectifying gaze to these nameless people who easily lose individuation and stand in as a symbol for a cultural failing that lacks nuance or specificity. Are the people Avedon photographed being exploited? Brustein made this observation in his wildly influential review of Nothing Personal. This inquiry returns us to the problem of what kind of project Avedon intended to pursuewhether it is one of education about an oppressed group for the purpose of sharing that information in hopes of reform, or whether this is just another one of his art projects. This is one place where the gap between intention and effect, and Sontags claim that photographs live a life of their own outside the photographers intentions, materializes. Even if Avedons intentions were harmless, the potential negative effect on the subjects cannot be ignored. To understand the complete picture, it must be acknowledged that there have been reactions of a different tenor to these photographs. Jane Livingston, author of the essay The Art of Richard Avedon that is included in his collection of photographs, Evidence, offers an alternative perspective: Entering over a matter of weeks into the closed-off, necessarily disturbing environment of a state psychiatric institution did not result in a voyeuristic peek into a nightmarish world. Far from violating others extreme dissociation or turmoil, the photographs illuminate the complicated province of mental and emotional illness. And they remind us of the condition shared by all human beings. (39) She finds that Avedon balances the particular and general in a way that honors the hardships apparent in the photographs and taps into the universalizing and thus reformatory potential of the images. One can see, then, in terms of the effects photographs have on the viewers, that there are a range or responses. Despite this variety, one strong thread has run through all of the reactions: these images are powerful. Are the images powerful because they invite the viewers identification with the subjects depicted, or do they produce what Bertolt Brecht has discussed in the context of his notion of a revolutionary, epic theatre an effect that alienates the viewer from the artwork? There are many aspects of these photos that invite us to relate to the subjects, particularly their humanity and their capacity for suffering. When I look at the photo taken at mid-range of a woman lying in bed, hands close to her face, eyebrows wrinkled with worry and sadness, what I notice is the level of detail of her fingernail (see http://www.richardavedon.com/#s=4&a=2&mi=2&pt=1&pi=10000&p=5&at=0). One response is, I have a fingernail too, I have a hand, and a body, and hair, and I cry, and I have the capacity to suffer. Perhaps that can be a way for me to understand this womans pain and to see her plight as my plight, to work to liberate her from the prison she is in. On the other hand, Avedon has created a great deal of distance between the subject and spectator with certain stylistic conventions. The images are grainy and overexposed, creating a surreal quality. The patients appear to be bathed in the white, sterile light of the institution. The space is medicalized, appearing different than the library or home interiors in which most would encounter Nothing Personal. And while some of the patients gestures appear familiar, such as people holding hands and waving hello, there are many bodily positions captured by Avedon that appear foreign. It is difficult to relate to the overwhelming number of patients who lay directly on the presumably cold, tile floors, or the woman who is searching inside of her mouth with her hand, or the grown woman who holds a baby doll securely and protectively to her breast. In addition, the uniforms worn by these patients mark them as inmates, as offenders, as unable to choose their adornments as productive members of society would. Baldwin writes, The uniform is designed to telegraph to others what to see so that they will not be made uncomfortable and probably hostile by being forced to look on another human being (Section 3). These ill-fitting uniforms communicate depravity to onlookers. The way Avedon has highlighted the inmates attire (see, for example, http://www.richardavedon.com/#s=8&a=2&mi=2&pt=1&pi=10000&p=5&at=0) makes use of the iconography of carceral images and documentary photos of Holocaust victims and survivors. These means of distancing create barriers between the spectator and subject, leading to greater potential for fear, misunderstanding, and stigmatization. These individuals grief and despair become so unrecognizable that viewers become alienated from what they are witnessing. Though this dehumanizing potential may sound unproductive, Brecht would see a value in that type of artistic maneuvering. He views unmediated identification with oppressed people as dangerous because what typically results from such an identification is an immediate experience of catharsis that leads to nothing more. In order to elicit deep thought and social action in the viewer, artists must create meaningful distance between the subject and viewer. Instead of viewers being seduced into thinking they can fully identify with the experience of the subject, they are jarred from the subjects experience and propelled into action. That is another potential effect of the photos that are central to this essay. Viewers may feel fear, discomfort, and the impulse to avert their eyes, but the shock of the image has the potential to inspire viewers to think critically about the subjects of the photo and take action on their behalf. This is a difficult road to travel, this question of whether or not images of suffering can inspire compassion and progressive political action. Sontag grapples with this issue in her book On Photography and returns to it decades later in Regarding the Pain of Others. In her earlier work, Sontag claims: To suffer is one thing; another thing is living with the photographed images of suffering, which does not necessarily strengthen conscience and the ability to be compassionate. It can also corrupt them. Once one has seen such images, one has started down the road of seeing moreand more. Images transfix. Images anesthetize (On Photography 20). Repeated exposure to difficult images can lead a person to become desensitized to them. In fact, the more I looked at the photos for this project, the more I was able to label my reaction to them and set it aside so that I could analyze them more closely. But Sontag revises her opinion in her later work and states that though photographs cannot tell us how to liberate people from their suffering (To designate a hell is not, of course, to tell us anything about how to extract people from that hell, how to moderate hells flames (Regarding 114)), the act of remembering triggered by photos does indeed have ethical value. The images say: This is what human beings are capable of doingmay volunteer to do, enthusiastically, self-righteously. Dont forget (Sontag, Regarding 115). There is value in displaying these difficult imagesif we are contemplating the suffering that is depicted in the photographs, we cannot simultaneously enact the violence that is presented (Sontag, Regarding 118). Sontag raises these issues of ethicality, claiming at the outset of On Photography that photographs create a new ethics of seeing, or a shift in cultural understanding of what is worth looking at and what we have the right to observe (3). I return to the question: when it is ethically justifiable to capture and share images of people who are in vulnerable positions? I want to be careful in saying that, by characterizing the subjects of these photos as vulnerable, I do not intend to take agency away from them. I am using the term vulnerable in that sense that their agency has already been taken away. One aspect of vulnerability as I discuss it is the capacity to give consent, the ability to understand the nature and consequences associated with an action before one can agree to participate. It is unclear whether those who were photographed gave their consent, or whether they had the capability to do so. Also, if consent was given instead by the institution or powers of attorney of these subjects, it is easy to see that there is little agency for the subjects in that transaction. Another aspect of vulnerability is a persons cultural positioningwhether there has been a decision made by someone other than the subject that he or she will be designated to a place of confinement, a place outside of the spaces of everyday living. This larger question of segregation of populations considered dangerous or different, along with issues of exploitation, invasiveness, enlightenment, and possible consciousness-raising of an unknowing public have been arisen throughout this essay. Perhaps something positive we can take away from Sontags struggle with what kinds of ethical knowledge photographs can produce, and our own difficult journey through the sometimes troubling and sometimes liberating intentions and effects (and gaps that lie between) of this series"
ENG.G0.01.1,Woolf's Women,English,Report,"As Virginia Woof sees it, the traditional roles of women in society seem as oppressive as being confined to the home, and as enslaving as being considered mere possessions of their husbands. In A Room of One's Own, Woolf subtly draws comparisons between a woman's subordinate lifestyle and a slave's inferior societal status. Constantly subjected to isolation and derogatory discourse, women lack both the respect and the opportunity needed in order to achieve social equality. Similarly trapped in rooms of their own, the women in Chopin's The Story of An Hour and in Gilman's The Yellow Wallpaper remain secluded from the outside world; similar to slaves, these women are unable to openly express their opinions and abilities without retaliated repression from men  their superiors by social standards. While slaves were born into subordination, women were married into it: [I]n fact she was the slave of any boy whose parents forced a ring upon her finger (Woolf 44). Woolf depicts the sacrament of marriage as an enforcement of social stratification instead of a symbiotic benchmark in a relationship. Once married, women become property of their husbands, like slaves to their masters, and can hardly read, and scarcely spell. Instead of being encouraged to express themselves, both slaves and women are forced to live simplistic lives free from the influence of literature or of higher education. Women lack these skills not because of disinterest, but instead because of social pressures: She picked up a book now and then, one of her brother's perhaps, and read a few pages. But then her parents came in and told her to mend the stockings or mind the stew and not moon about with books and papers (47). Conditioned to be ashamed of the desire to express their thoughts, women will scribble some pages up in an apple loft on the sly, but will be careful to hide them or set fire to them later, as the demonstration of intelligence seems to be a shameful sin. Men, distorted by their need for masculinity, further discourage women from playing active roles in society by talking down to them and distorting women's views of their importance in the greater community. Woolf emphasizes the constant re-enforcement of this male-dominated perspective by incorporating the term overcome in order to create a parallel between the plight of slavery and the struggle of women: There would always have been that assertion  you cannot do this, you are incapable of doing that  to protest against, to overcome (54). Woolf then powerfully refers to the gender struggle as [t]he history of men's opposition to women's emancipation, thus highlighting the imprisoning aspect of women's life in a patriarchal society (55). Meanwhile, women's hidden talent and contribution to humanity remains concealed by the oppressive ego's of their male counterparts. Similar to Virginia Woolf's portrayal of women in society, the woman from The Yellow Wallpaper also finds herself confined within the nightmarish pattern of female life. Driven to insanity from constantly holding back their intellectual talent, women become even more deeply trapped within the walls of oppression. The woman from the story becomes quarantined to a small room due to her diagnosed emotional madness. Left alone to analyze her surroundings, the woman becomes engaged in the intricacies of the faded yellow wallpaper. Eventually, she claims that several women, symbolizing herself and other demoralized women in her community, appear to be on the other side of the wallpaper, straining to break through its boundaries: Sometimes I think there are a great many women behind, and sometimes only one, and she crawls around fast, and her crawling shakes it all over (Gilman). The woman's desire to analyze the yellow paper acts as an emotional outlet for her suppressed intellect, as she strives to express her imaginative potential. Gilman further depicts the woman as coming to grips with her inferior status as the woman observes that the faces behind the wallpaper are all the time trying to climb through. But nobody could climb through that pattern  it strangles so. Metaphorically, women are constantly attempting to break through the gender barrier in which men enforce. However, the pattern, or traditional societal boundaries, will not submit. As Woolf suggests women's ownership to their husbands, Kate Chopin also speaks to women's enslavement to men. In The Story of an Hour, Mrs. Mallard experiences breathtaking relief upon hearing of the assumed death of her husband: She said it over and over under her breath: 'free, free, free'(Chopin). Although she feels slightly guilty for feeling joy instead of sorrow, Mrs. Mallard revels in the idea that [t]here would be no one to live for anymore, and instead she would live for herself. However, this feeling of freedom is short-lived, as is the false assumption of her husband's death; Mrs. Mallard's heart fails and she falls to her death upon the sight of her husband walking through the front door. Does her instantaneous death symbolize her eternal freedom from an oppressive marriage? Or does it instead represent a form of punishment for her happiness of the thought of her husband's death  re-emphasizing the attempt to keep women in their place? Ironically, while all three authors are elite, literary, educated women, they are still socially isolated and bound by sexist norms in society. Thus, Woolf, Gilman, and Chopin mirror the oppressed women in their stories; in a way, these authors make acknowledgeable statements about life from their perspectives by writing about upper-class women who still lack the opportunity to be viewed and treated as equal individuals, despite their economic statuses. Similarly, all of the authors must have felt emotionally tied-down to their husbands as they were simultaneously constrained by society  much like the struggling women in the stories. Therefore, the authors can almost be viewed as portraying nuances of their own personal struggles in the third-person. From Woolf to Chopin, the subordination of women in a gender-stratified society puts a damper on their traditional intellectual and social development. Like slaves, women from earlier centuries were viewed and treated as mere accessories to American culture. Fortunately, similar to any other frivolous trend, the concept of the inferiority of women continues to outdate itself.

ENG.G0.01.2,Douglas's Declaration,English,Report,"The concept of freedom carries a relative and subjective meaning. Every Fourth of July, the people of the United States magically forget their previous battles with family members, neighbors, and third-world-countries, as they gather over grilled food and under explosive fireworks. The initial importance of our country's freedom from British control dissipates as quickly as a pack of sparklers. In his Address, What to the Slave is the Fourth of July, delivered on July 5, 1852, Frederick Douglass glorifies the people's perpetual praise of America's patriotic accomplishments, which Jefferson launched through the Declaration of Independence. Douglass relates to his audience of white abolitionists by using rhetorical devices and stylistic approaches while acknowledging the ambitious accomplishments of the country's Founding Fathers. His powerful use of repetition, metaphor, and juxtaposition, combined with strategic syntax and tonal shifts enhance his argument as he engages his audience and maintains credibility � all of which assist in unraveling his shocking conclusion that American values are more impressive on paper than in practice. Douglass initially speaks from the same level as that of his audience; by stating that he is nervous to be speaking to a large crowd and by addressing the public as his fellow-citizens, Douglass temporarily adopts the viewpoint of an American on Independence Day in order to establish credibility for both himself and his argument (Douglass 380). He uses metaphor as he joins his audience in praising the resilience of the Founding Fathers: As the sheet anchor takes a firm hold, when the ship is tossed by the storm, so did the cause of your fathers grow stronger. . . (381). The stormy fight for independence triumphed with the Declaration of Independence, the ring-bolt in the destiny of the nation. The metaphor of the ring-bolt is designed to give the audience a tangible grasp of the significance of the declaration and leaves them the option of reaping the fruits of success. After acknowledging America's past achievements, Douglass dramatically shifts his tone as he isolates himself from the collective group by saying that he will see this day and its popular characteristics from the slave's point of view and that this Fourth of July is yours, not mine (386). He claims that July 4th makes a mockery of the realistic situation in America and poses a series of rhetorical questions comparing himself with other citizens: What have I, or those I represent, to do with your national independence? (385) Combining the device of anaphora with more rhetorical questions, he emphasizes his accusations of American ignorance through the phrases you have no right and need I tell you in order to escalate his authority and ethos. Douglass then stresses America's arrogance through antithesis as he juxtaposes people's shallow tolerance with people's actual behavior in their own nation; he condemns the way they are all on fire at the mention of liberty for France or for Ireland; but are as cold as an iceberg at the thought of liberty for the enslaved of America (389). Additionally, with Douglass' allusion back to Jefferson and the Declaration, the audience can infer that Douglass implies that although Jefferson symbolized freedom, he owned hundreds of slaves himself, thus further demonstrating the ironic tendencies of human nature and the hypocritical message in his independence speech. While Douglas dramatically shifts his tone from sharing brotherhood with his audience to speaking in a condescending manner, he equivocates by concluding his speech with a quote by William Lloyd Garrison. By leaving the audience with the inspirational words of God speed the year of jubilee / the wide world o'er, Douglass reinstates the speech's patriotic undertone (390). He ends on a positive note in order to re-establish any credibility that he might have lost during the speech and to ensure that he motivates his audience; it is up to them to mobilize the Declaration of Independence into action like their Founding Fathers had done in past generations. Douglass demands a new Declaration. The Michigan Corpus of Upper-level Student Papers (MICUSP) is owned by the Regents of the University of Michigan (UM), who hold the copyright.

ENG.G0.10.1,Close Reading Paper: The Tempest (4.1.146-163),English,Report,"PROSPERO 146 You do look, my son, in a mov�d sort, As if you were dismayed. Be cheerful, sir. Our revels now are ended. These our actors, As I foretold you, were all spirits and 150 Are melted into air, into thin air; And, like the baseless fabric of this vision, The cloud-capped towers, the gorgeous palaces, The solemn temples, the great globe itself, Yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve, 155 And, like this insubstantial pageant faded, Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff As dreams are made on, and our little life Is rounded with a sleep. Sir, I am vexed. Bear with my weakness: my old brain is troubled. 160 Be not disturbed with my infirmity. If you be pleased, retire into my cell And there repose. A turn or two I'll walk To still my beating mind. This passage works as a literary mechanism to systematically discuss the interaction between dreams and life. It is structured into three distinct sections which logically interact to convey a single message within the passage. Through the use of short poetic prose, rich diction, and figurative language a dream-like setting is established and related to real-life. This relationship between dreams and the ephemeral nature of life is the underlying message of the passage, and its acknowledgement is essential to the success of the protagonist's plans. The passage begins in an amicable tone in which the speaker comforts the characters and the reader. This tone is produced through the lines, You do look, my son, in a mov�d sort, / As if you were dismayed. Be cheerful, sir./ Our revels now are ended. By using the term my son the passage instantly develops an endearing paternal tone of wisdom, which works to accredit the advice which will follow. In addition, the sense of comfort that the text creates by using Be cheerful, sir. also helps to prepare the reader for the disheartening interpretation of life which they are about to receive. The second section of the passage, which can be termed the philosophical phase, includes lines 148-158. In this section the text refers to the spirits as our actors, which indicates that the speaker believes that he can direct the actions of those who live within his world. Yet, within the same sentence that he proclaims his control he also posits that his power is in actuality insubstantial because the spirits are melted into air, into thin air. The imagery invoked by the melting spirits begins to create a dream-like setting for the reader to imagine these occurrences and with the next lines these images are substantiated. The passage asserts, The cloud-capped towers, the gorgeous palaces,/ The solemn temples, the great globe itself,/ Yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve,. This classic fairytale imagery is one which can easily be formed yet can also quickly be disassembled, which is helpful for the reader but also symbolic of the transient nature of dreams as well as life. Furthermore, the passage's inclusion of the globe along with the fantastical images of the towers and palaces also serves to indicate that for some people, including those set in the play, the real world may be synonymous with the dream world. However, in the following lines we are reminded that both are equally as fleeting. Lines 155-156 use diction to relate life as an insubstantial pageant, creating the imagery of an insignificant parade or procession, which expresses a bleak interpretation of life set in this dream state. The passage eventually concludes its philosophical section by more or less clarifying that there is a relationship between the real life and dreams, yet this section is open to interpretation because of its contradictory language. In lines 156-158 the text reads, We are such stuff/ As dreams are made on, and our little life/ Is rounded with a sleep. Seemingly, when reading this quote in the context of the rest of the passage one may be able to interpret the lines as meaning that if life is composed of dreams, and dreams are particularly transitory, then life itself is transitory. Furthermore, it is in our very nature to dream and even when we are sleeping and taking a rest from pursuing our dreams, we are forming new ambitions which we as humans are forced to pursue. After coming to the conclusion that life is futile because of its relationship with dreams, the passage enters its third stage which is characteristically apologetic. This section uses excusatory diction to offer an apology to the reader for confronting them with the brutal realities of life which the speaker must face everyday. Indeed, in line 160 he states, Be not disturbed by my infirmity. The word infirmity may have numerous definitions but in this context it is likely a condition or disease produced by weakness, and in this case moral weakness. It seems that the text concludes that the struggle for full realization of ones dreams is useless and debilitating. In order to comfort the reader and dissuade them from facing this fact of life, the passage recommends that they go to sleep and, ironically, take a rest from living their dreams. Within the context of The Tempest this passage conveys to the reader that Prospero has come to an understanding of the reasons behind his downfall as Duke of Milan. Prospero acknowledges that his complete devotion to his dream of bettering his mind, ultimately cost him his kingdom because he was not knowledgeable of how one must manage their dreams. Indeed, at the moment that this speech is given in the play, he nearly allows his dreams and art to once again lead to his demise as he forgets about Caliban's plot to murder him while watching the nymphs' performance. However, in the end, he does remind himself with this passage about the relationship between life and dreams, and the way in which he must control it. The passage, through its analysis, allows the reader to understand the principles that are essentially responsible for the success of Prospero's plan. In conclusion, each section and line of the passage plays a specific part in communicating the relationship between dreams and life and the transitory qualities of both. Through diction and figurative language the text systematically builds a dream world only to then dismantle it, and relate to the reader a specific perception of life. This cautionary speech about the devastating power that dreams can have on a person's life is essentially a moral of The Tempest. Without this close reading of the passage the full wisdom of the text may have never been discovered.

ENG.G0.13.2,Abraham Drafted to Team Galatians,English,Report,"Paul writes his letter to the Galatians during a transitional period for Christianity. Christianity has not yet become independent of Judaism, but is moving farther away from the observances of Jewish laws. This issue proves to be a point of intense controversy, and Paul takes a side against following Jewish law. In his letter, Paul attempts to explain to the Galatians how Gentiles are blessed through Jesus and why there is no need for them to adopt the code of Moses. Specifically in verse three, Paul makes a critical offensive move for his cause by aligning himself and his views with an important central figureAbraham. Proving to be a powerful rhetorician, Paul effectively employs language, spins quotations, aims at logic, and provides answers to position Abraham in a way that supports his views. It is likely at such a confusing and controversial time for Christianity that Paul himself did not really know how the Jesus movement should fit in with the previous laws of Judaism. It seems Paul knew he had to make some statement on this controversy, but was not completely sure what it should be. He does offer a number of opinions on the subject, but few of them are grounded in tangible evidence. However, it is evident in Galatians 3 that Paul knows how to present a persuasive argument. It doesn't matter so much what claim he makes, just that he makes it wholeheartedly. In this way, Paul lays the foundation for his alignment with Abraham even before he mentions the story of Abraham through his effective use of language. Paul immediately begins verse three by accusing the Galatians: You foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you? (Galatians 3:1). The first half of this address runs the risk of overly offending the listeners and having them dismiss the rest of Paul's address. However, Paul cleverly adds the second part which plays off the basic human dislike for being tricked. Now the people are not only eager to listen to Paul and find out how they have been fooled, but also eager to believe Paul's words. So even before the story of Abraham is discussed, Paul has set the stage for the Galatians to accept his version of it. Paul's confident language serves to further the agreeability of what he has to say. The passage is full of small and easily overlooked phrases that prove to be incredibly powerful in the context. He strategically employs such phrases as so you see (3:7), for it is written (3:10), and it is evident (3:11) to create an air of assurance that seems impossible to disagree with. As one point Paul asks, Is the law then opposed to the promises of God? and then answers himself by exclaiming, Certainly not! (3:21). Not only is Paul certain of what he is saying, but also adds an exclamation point for added emphasis on this point. Interspersed with these strong words of suggestion are pointed rhetorical questions; Paul uses these to engage his reader in accepting his claims. By having no stated answer it would seem that the questions were open for discussion, however, on the contrary, these questions leave no room for dispute. For example, Paul asks, &does God supply you with the Spirit and work miracles among you by your doing the works of the law, or by your believing what you heard? (3:5). The clear answer Paul is aiming for with this leading question is that God provides the spirit to the people through faith and not through the Jewish laws. This answer helps the Galatians believe in Paul's words because Paul has twisted his rhetoric in a way that makes the answer obvious. The readers of this letter are made to feel like complete fools if they do not side with Paul. The Galatians would also readily acknowledge the answer to this rhetorical question, though, because Paul makes the answer the easy choice. The Galatians want to receive the Spirit, and it is much easier to receive it by believing than by numerous difficult and extensive Jewish laws. After expertly priming the Galatians to heed his words, Paul introduces the story of Abraham. In an interesting reinterpretation of the Abraham story, Paul positions Abraham to play on his team. It is confusing that Paul chooses to focus on the importance of Abraham since Abraham is prominent in the Jewish tradition, but, while it is curious, it is something that may not have seemed so at the time. It is also possible that while Paul was attempting to break away from the church in Jerusalem, he did not have a full conception of what that would mean. The text is silent on many of these holes in Paul's reasoning. One way Paul uses Abraham to promote his views is by putting a new spin on previous quotations from the Bible. Paul uses an earlier quote to explain that just as Abraham 'believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness,'& those who believe are the descendants of Abraham (3:6-7). This is only one of many places Paul could be accused of espousing false or skewed logic with his reinterpretation of quotes. It cannot logically be assumed that everyone who believes in God is the descendant of Abraham just because Abraham believed. In this example, Paul delves further into questionable logic by explaining that those who believe are blessed with Abraham who believed (3:9). He gives little support for any of these claims, but instead relies on his overbearing rhetoric to cover up flaws in reasoning. Another place that Paul spins an earlier Biblical quotation to serve his purposes is when he quotes, Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree, and then interprets Jesus' cross as a tree. He explains that Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us&in order that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles, so that we might receive the promise of Spirit through faith (3:13-14). Now Paul is stretching his reasoning to not only align Abraham with his promotion of faith and not Jewish law, but also extend this affiliation through Abraham all the way to Jesus himself. In essence, Paul is forming an undoubtedly powerful team of players to support his offensive move against the Christians who uphold Jewish laws. There are points in this third verse where Paul also directly aims at logic, whether valid or faulty logic, to promote his views by using Abraham. Paul makes an analogy between a person's will and God's promise to Abrahamjust as a will cannot be later added to or annulled neither can God's covenant be added to with laws. He is appealing to the Galatians sense of logic by stating the irrelevance of the Moses code. My point is this: the law, which came four hundred thirty years later, does not annul a covenant previously ratified by God, so as to nullify the promise (3:17). This is a clever move by Paul since he does not claim that these laws do not exist (it is clear they have had a long history), but only that they came after Abraham and no longer serve a purpose now that the people have been delivered through Jesus Christ. After lying the foundation for and giving his reinterpretation of the Abraham story, Paul smartly gives his answers for the inevitable questions surrounding his interpretation. Paul offers an explanation for how the Jewish laws fit with the Christian faith, and, like he has throughout the letter, he pronounces this with utter certainty: Now before faith came, we were imprisoned and guarded under the law until faith would be revealed. Therefore the law was our disciplinarian until Christ came, so that we might be justified by faith (3:23-24). In this way, Paul explains away the Jewish laws by telling the Galatians why they are no longer necessary. Paul also expertly answers the inevitable question about how the Gentiles fit into this whole picture of Abraham and Jesus, and how all the differing traditions can come together. His main way of doing this is by eliminating the differences that spawn controversy. There is no longer Jew or Greek, there is no longer slave or free, there is no longer male and female; for all of you are one in Christ Jesus. And if you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham's offspring, heirs according to the promise (3:28-29). This seems to be the final push for the success of Paul's words. Obviously the Galatians would be thrilled to hear that they are Abraham's offspring and that this is made possible through their belief in Jesus Christ. Throughout his letter, Paul is addressing a willing audience. They want to believe his words and he ensures that they do by promoting his cause through Abraham. Paul proves to be a master rhetorician as he plays with language and logic to champion faith in Jesus over the belief in the Moses code. As his writing progresses, Paul's argument only gains momentum; it is hard to remember if there is any other way to understand the Bible. The recipients of this letter may have started out foolish, but they end almost as heirs to God.

ENG.G0.16.1,Humans and Animals in the Book of Genesis,English,Report,"One of the most important relationships in the book of Genesis is the relationship between mankind and animals. In the early chapters of the book of Genesis, we learn about Adam and Eve's relationship with animals and how their relationship changed over time. Initially, Adam and Eve were told by God to have dominion over all animals in Genesis1:28 and Adam was said to have given the animals their names in Genesis 1:20. Man is also told in Genesis 1:29-30 that God has given him plants for his food. However, in chapter 9 of Genesis, after the worldwide flood, mankind's relationship with the animal world changes drastically. God tells Noah that animals will fear him, that they are delivered into his (mankind's) hand, and that mankind can now eat animals for food (Genesis 9:2). Although the text is not completely clear on why God began to allow man to eat animals, animals play key roles in both man's initial disobedience to God and in God's attempt to reestablish a harmonious relationship with mankind. In the first chapter of Genesis, in verses 24 through 27, we learn that God created animals on the 5th day of creation and humans on the 6th day. In Genesis 1:28, God gives an important commandment to Adam (and Eve) about their relationship with animals and their position and power upon the earth. In Genesis 1:28, God tells them to have dominion over all animals. Dominion is a type of leadership or established rule that denotes a hierarchical structure. In essence mankind was given a leadership role over all of the animals. Although mankind still seems to have dominion over animals later in Genesis, the relationship between animals and humans changes. In the following quote from Genesis 9:2-3, God speaks to Noah after the worldwide flood and provides information that we can assume is for all mankind. The fear and dread of you shall rest on every animal of the earth, and on every bird of the air, on everything that creeps on the ground, and on all the fish of the sea; into your hand they are delivered. Every moving thing that lives shall be food for you; and just as I gave you he green plants, I give you everything (Genesis 9:2-3). Man will now be feared and dreaded by all types of animals and man is told that God has given him everything. The question is; why did God allow mankind to eat animals after the flood and not before the flood? How does this connect with the roles animals played in Adam's disobedience and mankind's subsequent struggle to have a relationship with God? The answers to these questions are not completely clear. One of the notes in our version of The New Oxford Annotated Bible hints at a possible reason God allowed man to eat animals. On page 22, near the bottom, editorial authors state, Here [referring to Gen. 9:2 quoted above] God revises the earlier command of vegetarianism&This is a partial concession to the ""violence"" observed prior to the flood and an extension of the human dominion over creation&(Oxford, 22). Here the authors wanted to portray God as conceding or giving in to the violence taking place on the earth before the flood mentioned in Genesis 6:5. We can't be sure exactly why God chose to allow man to eat animals and there are a number of reasons that can be presented. We must first remember how an animal played a role in man's initial disobedience. The serpent was an animal that made an effort to convince Eve to eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Therefore, it's safe to say that an animal played a role in mankind's first known disobedience toward God. The serpent wasn't responsible for Adam and Eve's decision to eat from the forbidden tree, but asked questions that piqued Eve' curiosity. Eve was persuaded and chose to eat from the tree. She subsequently gave the fruit to Adam and he ate. In this sense, an animal played a role in man's first act of disobedience to God (Genesis 3). Perhaps God punished all animals because of the sin of one animal [the serpent] in influencing man to disobey God. As a result of the deceitful ways of the serpent, God may have chosen to punish all animals for the serpent's role in causing man's strained relationship with God. The serpent was given a special curse from God in Genesis 3:14-15. God tells the serpent in these verses that it is cursed&among all animals and that it will eat dust for the rest of its life. The text is unclear on whether all other animals were punished for the actions of the serpent, but we know that man's relationship with animals changed after mankind sinned and certainly after the flood. Animals became first a physical type of provision for mankind and then became a type of symbol for God's spiritual provision for wrongdoing. After Genesis 9:2, animals are given to man for his physical sustenance and well-being. Adam and Eve are physically sustained by animals after God allows them to eat meat. In order for mankind to eat those animals, however, they have to die and suffer. This is a sort of parallel to the symbolic spiritual provision that man is provided by the death of animals. In Genesis 8:20, we see Noah building an altar to God and sacrificing burnt offerings to God using animals. The text doesn't explicitly state why Noah chose to sacrifice these animals, but from subsequent areas in the Bible, we learn that animal sacrifice was often done as a way to praise God or as an act of penitence towards God in order to receive God's forgiveness. Initially, after Adam and Eve sinned, they recognized that they were naked and covered themselves with fig leaves. After covering themselves with fig leaves, God later covers them with skins. There is a silent spot in the text in the sense that it doesn't say when, where, or how God obtained the skins he used to cover Adam and Eve. A creator God could have simply created the skins. Skin, however, is usually associated with a living creature and therefore it's safe to ask questions of the text. Does the text or the writer want us to assume that God killed an animal or animals to use their skins to cover Adam and Eve? If so, what symbolic implications does such an action provide? If the text were leading us to think that God killed certain animals for their skins to cover Adam and Eve, why would he have done such a thing? Why didn't he allow them to keep the fig leaves as coverings for themselves? If indeed God killed animals or allowed them to die, such an act could be likened to the animal sacrifice that is later seen when Noah sacrifices animals (Genesis 3, 8). The shedding of an animal's blood for food and its subsequent consumption by man is a symbolic act. When man sheds the blood of an animal and prepares it for food, he is satisfied. In Genesis 8:21, we see that God smells the odor of the animal sacrifice and God is pleased. Although God's pleasure is more concerned with Noah's act of penitence before Him, God's pleasure with the sacrifice almost mirrors the pleasure someone would have after eating a good meal. In a sense, man's physical sustenance by animals that have to die is symbolic of God's sort of appeasement when man sacrifices animals to God as an act of penitence. Although the Biblical text is not completely clear on why God began to allow man to eat animals, animals play key roles in both man's initial disobedience to God and in God's attempt to reestablish a harmonious relationship with mankind. The serpent, an animal, initially tempted man and man subsequently disobeyed God by eating from the forbidden tree. After the flood, God allowed man to eat animals and caused animals to fear man. In the end, God's permitting of mankind to eat animals and be physically sustained by them is symbolic of the ways in which God seeks to reestablish a harmonious relationship with mankind.

ENG.G0.17.2,"Survival in Auschwitz: Irony, Reality, and Power",English,Report,"It was my good fortune to be deported to Auschwitz only in 1944, (9) Levi prefaces Survival is Auschwitz with what could be considered either a terribly ironic or completely absurd statement. Indeed, how can one be at all fortunate to be sent to Auschwitz in any given year? However, Levi's thought process is consistent with the mentality that the Nazi's imposed in their management of the Lager. In Survival in Auschwitz, Levi examines the perceptual shifts that occurred among both the inmates and individuals in various positions of power that were necessary for their mental and physical survival. There is a certain sick humor in the Nazis stewardship of Auschwitz, which Levi exposes through various ironies in the novel. Arbeit Mact Frei: work gives freedom (22). This slogan appears upon Levi's arrival at the camp. The phrase, so vital that it haunts Levi's dreams (an emotional aside otherwise rare in the work) is ironic in two ways: First, it is clearly a lie. Those entering the camp know that they will likely die and the Germans of course know this for certain. Levi writes, in a few weeks nothing will remain of them but a handful of ashes in some near-by field and a crossed-out number on a register (89). Second, despite the statistical inevitability of death, the inmates go to work anyway each day, even though they could choose to die instantly, at any moment you want you could always go and touch the electric wire-fence (131). Though the future inmates know that they are being selected for their deaths (sooner or later), and the Nazis are also acutely aware of this fact, the initial selection is conducted with administrative calm, silent as an aquarium (19). How can the Nazis be so emotionally detached? How can the Jews be so quiet? Gone is the German's millennial anger, replaced by an indifferent air& subdued& with a clam assurance of people doing their normal duty of every day. The level of emotional detachment seems almost unreal. Even Levi has difficulty understanding these emotional transformations: man's capacity to dig himself in, to secrete a shell, to build around himself a tenuous barrier of defense, even in apparently desperate circumstances, is astonishing and merits a serious study. It is based on an invaluable activity of adaptation (56). The administrative procedure, the calm, is their shield. Perhaps because Levi is also able to separate his emotions from his writing, he may have an unfortunate but unique ability to understand the Germans. By warping reality, the Nazis exert their greatest level of control - greater even than physical labor or mental enslavement. They control rationality and reality as a whole. So total is their power that they can create dysreality under the guise of reason. Levi typifies this with the story of Elias, the dwarf. Elias is ironically best suited for work in the Lager, even though his achondroplasia would have been considered a major disability in the outside world. Levi comments, to imagine Elias as a free man requires a great effort of fantasy (96). Despite the contradictory nature of Elias' prosperity, the Lager is the Nazi's reality. Rules are always subject to change. And since animal law and generalized insanity rule in the Lager, Elias is similarly described as animalistic: you can see every muscle taut under his skin, like a poised animal& a sense of bestial vigor emanates from his body& like a monkey and insane. Yet, in the final irony, since Elias is so fit to work, he is not required to: by the absurd law of the Lager& he practically ceased to work. Even though Elias lives with an obvious genetic defect, he is nonetheless safe from the selections (97-98) that by the Nazi's own dogma of genetic purity should have sent him to the furnace. In the Lager, Levi shows that it is actually possible to have a good wound (47). Furthermore, Levi was fortunate to spend as much time in the infirmary as he did, since being sick  to a point  equals better health and recovery than staying well. This paradox is compounded by the absurdity of the Germans even having an infirmary in a camp built for death. Indeed, if all the Jews in the camp are to die, then why do the German's even have an infirmary? Why bother? There are countless new prisoners arriving each day to take the ill's place, and the tasks they are assigned to are meaningless, Levi laments, the Buna factory, on which the Germans were busy for four years and for which countless of us suffered and died, never produced a pound of synthetic rubber (73). Levi himself seems not to fully understand the mental dynamics of the Lager. He reflects during one day of work, it is lucky that it is not windy today. Strange, how in some way one always has the impression of being fortunate (131). Only in Auschwitz, it seems, could one receive a lovingly beating: some of [the Kapos] beat us from pure bestiality and violence, but others beat us when we are under a load almost lovingly. The pinnacle of all ironies, however, is when a man doomed to death from the selection insists on advertising the fact  rather than trying to hide it  in order to get his double ration (129). Moreover, why do the Germans even provide a double ration? This could be a way in which the Germans further exert their power. Perhaps it is another shell to protect what humanity remains in them. Or, perhaps this is another instance of the Nazi's utter insanity. Given Levi's background as a scientist, it is not unsurprising that he views the Lager as a nearly incomprehensible social experiment (87). His ability to separate emotion from reality is what makes his work so compelling and true, that none of the facts are invented (10). One must wonder if Levi's disposition is due entirely to his scientific background and near-perfect memory, or rather is a product of the Nazi's selection process; that in order to survive, or at least have a small chance of surviving, one had to emulate the Nazi's warped and emotionally disconnected, pathological mentality. Henri, who Levi portrays as being one of the best adapted and certain to survive inmates, is described similarly to the Nazis, enclosed in armor, inhumanly cunning and incomprehensible (100). However, given the parallel of the ideal survivor's mental traits to that of the Nazis, and Levi's contempt for them, it is not unsurprising that Levi would never want to see Henri  or himself, ultimately  ever again.

ENG.G0.19.1,A compare and contrast paper using two texts from a Science Fiction course,English,Report,"What does it mean to be a vegetarian? Is it a declaration of animal rights? An attempt to minimize one's ecological impact? Perhaps the next step on the moral ladder in promotion of humanitarian demeanor? Whatever the case, the statistics speak for themselves as the domino effects sparked by the eating of meat embark huge ecological problems across the globe. From a production standpoint, it is much more efficient to produce vegetation than meat as the quantity of resources spent feeding and raising animals devastate the environment. From an ethical standpoint, in selecting vegetarianism, one deters away from innate animalistic tendencies by stoically prioritizing morals over desires. But whatever the reason in choosing a vegetarian lifestyle, there is no doubt that it is ultimately represents as an advanced form of humanitarianism. The choice serves a moral sensibility and commitment to the surrounding world and its creatures. Authors Mary Shelley and H.G. Wells both publicly asserted their confidence in vegetarianism, which is clearly reflected in their work. Shelley's Creature in Frankenstein in addition to Wells's race of Eloi in The Time Machine both uphold vegetarian lifestyles in which both writers call attention to the vegetarian ideal  a moral and ethical obligation humans have to their surroundings. Shelley's Creature and Wells's Eloi share their differences, however are connected by their vegetarian diet. Through repetition, both authors make their character's vegetarian lifestyle very clear to the reader. This was no accident; both Shelley and Wells were prominent activists of the vegetarian lifestyle. Wells often used vegetarian characters in his novels and The Time Machine was no exception. His novel Utopia was perhaps his most famous meat-eating rebuke as he writes of utopia existing in vegetarian form. Shelley came from a family of vegetarian activists as her father and husband actively published essays encouraging animal rights. Thus, it was no minor detail that Eloi and Creature live vegetarian lifestyles. In Shelley's Frankenstein, Shelley proposes an interesting juxtaposition: though the Creature is ugly and demon-like in features, he possesses a virtuous character and an astounding intelligence for an uneducated being. Having taught himself to read and then having read Paradise Lost, Plutarch's Lives, and The Sorrows of Young Werther during his time as the DeLacy's guest, Shelley makes a point to expound the Creature's intelligence and sophistication (127). Her vast illustration of the Creature's moral and intellectual credibility adds to the cogency of his vegetarianism, as he exists as a being who contemplates the exploitation of others. He remarks to Victor Frankenstein of his vegetarian choice, my food is not that of man; I do not destroy the lamb and the kid to glut my appetite; acorns and berries afford me sufficient nourishment (146). The Creature's vegetarianism announces its separation from his creator's moral code by including animals in its moral circle. This inclusion symbolizes the Creature's attempt to exist in human society as he has embraced animals in his. Despite leading an example for moral supremacy, the Creature proves unable to enter human society, finding it to be formed in such a way that both it and animals are omitted from it. The continuing rejections by human beings represent Shelley's paralleling view of the meat-eating society, as human vanity only allows man as his moral center, proving unable to subsume ugly beings or animals. With this in consideration, the Creature's beliefs serve as an emblem for what it desires for and needs but ultimately falls short in receiving from human society. Shelley concludes her novel with bleak hope for her Creature and in doing so, argues for human empathy and a humanitarian obligation to man has to living creatures. H.G. Wells's race of Eloi share the vegetarian nature of Victor Frankenstein's Creature, but unlike the Creature who asserts his decision to living a vegetarian lifestyle, Eloi's history of vegetarianism remains unclear. What is clear is that common animals used for eating became extinct  potentially from lack of necessity, which points to a societal abandonment of meat. These people of the remote future were strict vegetarians&I found afterwards that horses, cattle, sheep, dogs had followed the Ichthyosaurus into extinction (44). Though vegetarian in lifestyle, Eloi do not appear to share the same fervor of this decision as Victor's Creature does. In fact, the Time Traveler (TT) describes them as children, carefree and scatterbrained, and in recalling his rescue of Weena, he describes the deficiency in Eloi as none made the slightest attempt to rescue her (59). The lack of fidelity and empathy among Eloi juxtaposes their vegetarian humanism as Wells calls for the necessity in supporting one's comrades. Wells furthers this argument in contrasting Eloi's vegetarianism with the carnivorous Morlocks, whom, the TT eventually discovers, tend to Eloi for the same reasons as a farmer tends to cattle. To the TT this appears grossly inhumane, but Wells neatly parallels Morlocks' consumption of Eloi to our current usage of cattle  gently reminding readers of their own carnivorous behavior. Like Shelley, Wells uses Eloi's lack of devotion to each other and Morlocks' carnivorous behavior to demonstrate his call for man's humanitarian obligation to his surroundings. In both Frankenstein and The Time Machine, Mary Shelley and H.G. Wells construct arguments for a more morally sensible and responsible society; a society curtailing meat and apathy and heightening empathy and compassion. Using vegetarianism as a symbol of humanitarianism, both authors call for a moral and ethical obligation of man to his surroundings.

ENG.G0.22.2,"Chaucer's ""The Franklin's Tale"" and Boccaccio's Il Filocolo",English,Report,"Chaucer used Boccaccio's Il Filocolo as an analogue for the Franklin's Tale, and the stories have a great number of similaritiestheir basic characters, their basic plot, and their final questions about the characters. But the differences between the two stories show where Chaucer made choices and how they affect the interpretation of the story. They show the issues Chaucer was interested in, and the ideals or morals he was concerned with. Chaucer's changes deal with the social position of the middle class, valuing love versus just honor, and social strictures and appearances, creating a story that invites audience interpretation. Chaucer has the Franklin tell this tale, a man whose social position differs greatly from Boccaccio's narrator, a noble named Menedon. The Franklin is of the middle class, but wealthy, and attempting to make his way into the nobility through his wealth and actions. This raises the issue of nobility in generalcan people only enter this estate through blood connections, or do wealth and character give access? Unlike Boccaccio's tale, which ends with two noble characters, the Queen and Menedon, authoritatively explaining who they think the most liberal is, Chaucer leaves open the possibility for who the most fre is in the Franklin's Tale. He leaves this issue of the source of nobility up for debate. Both fre and liberal, the adjectives used in the final question posed in each story, have a number of different meanings according to the Middle English Dictionary. In general, their meanings are very similarbeing noble, in birth or by character, or being unrestricted in movement or action. (This latter definition can lead to an interesting interpretation of the final question, that may be somewhat different than the standard interpretation of who is the most generous or noble). However, there are also subtle differences between the two definitions that may explain why Chaucer chose to ask about being fre over having great liberalitie. To be fre is to have the social status of a noble or freeman, which is not the same as being nobly born, one of the meanings of liberal. With fre, those who have a high social status because of their wealth and generosity, but are not necessarily nobly born, such as the wealthy middle class, are also included. Other definitions of fre also allow for these non-noblesthose who have a privileged status, and those who possess the rights and privileges of a citizen of a town or city. Liberal does not include these extra variations other than the possibility of being free in general. Interestingly, liberal separates selfless, admirable from generous, while fre just has generous, open-handed in addition to noble in character; noble in appearance. With fre, some of the descriptors from liberal may be included, but are defined as specifically noble attributes. Because of its greater amount of definitions, there is more room for interpretation within the definition of fre. But before the impact of these words comes into play comes the content of both stories. The characters of each are generally similar, but slightly different in their naming and characteristics. While Boccaccio's tale features an unnamed noble knight with an unnamed noble wife, and another knight, Tarolfo, who is in love with the aforementioned noble woman, Chaucer's includes a named knight and lady, Arveragus and Dorigen, and a squire Aurelius. Boccaccio has an poor old man, Theban, who is an actual magician; Chaucer has a young, unnamed clerk who is a scientist illusionist. These differences in naming point to different emphases of characters in each story. One way to look at it is that those who remain unnamed become characters that represent a generalization of that type of person, leaving them open for more interpretation and general sympathy, whereas named characters are more specific. The two authors' emphases and generalizations are practically opposite, perhaps because of the social positions of the two narrators. The Franklin wants to leave the clerk up for the most sympathy and interpretation, while Menedon favors the nobles. However, interpretation of these naming choices could also be seen in an opposite way, where those unnamed are less sympathetic. This allows for more of a focus to be put on the follies of those who are named and therefore more responsible for their actions. Chaucer's tale also places much more of an emphasis on the love between Arveragus and Dorigen than Boccaccio's does on the knight and his wife. Arveragus and Dorigen are happily married and live a blissful lyf together (806), and they are so in love that the balance of power in their relationship is even somewhat egalitarian. Dorigen has more freedom than many wives: Arveragus is her servant in love, and lord in mariage (FT V.793). She relates this freedom to her husband's aristocratic rank, and says, sith of youre gentillesse / Ye profre me to have so large a reyne (FT V.754-5). As a result of her happiness with her situation, she swears to be youre humble trewe wyf & till that myn herte breste (FT V.758-9). There is no mention of this sort of love or this equal balance of power within a relationship in Boccaccio's story. Chaucer introduces this type of relationship as a contrast with the relationships of many of the other tales in his work, and to show a type of love possible in a marriage that Boccaccio does not. Dorigen's love for her husband is apparent from the depression that results when he is away for so long, although her friends tell her that causelees she sleeth hirself (FT V. 825). She does not even enjoy the beautiful May weather and a garden so wonderful that nevere was ther gardyn of swich prys / But if it were the verray paradys (FT V.911-2), but is instead distressed. It is this love which leads her to suggest that getting rid of the rocks on the coast which separate the shore from the sea, and cause so many deaths, would be the one thing for which she could be with another man; removal of the rocks would make her feel closer to her love. But she really says this because she sees it as something impossibleshe says it in pley (FT V.988)as a way to show that under no circumstances will she ever love another man. There is no such powerful love on the part of the gentlewoman in Boccaccio's tale; he says only that her husband loved her with most loyall love (Boccaccio 1)1. She is merely attempting to stop the other knight from trying to woo her, so he does not end up getting in a fight with her husband, who might hear about his continuing attentions. She, too, makes up a task that is an impossible thing, so that in this sort I shall rid him from me (Boccaccio 2). Her task for Tarolfo, however, has nothing to do with her love for her husband, but actually resembles the garden that Dorigen, truly in love, was unable to enjoy. This garden would be a gift and something that she could conceive no way of actually creating. Because the women's motivations are different, their reactions to the completion of these impossible tasks are also different. Dorigen does not even go look to see if the rocks are actually gone when Aurelius tells her he has made them disappearshe is just shocked. She wende nevere han come in swich a trappe. / Allas, quod she, that evere this sholde happe! / For wende I nevere by possibilitee / That swich a monstre or merveille myghte be! (FT V.1341-4). She is too distressed by the fact that she might actually have pledged her love to another man to even be interested in seeing the evidence that she so wanted to see earlier, when she looked out on the rocks and meditated how mankynd [they] destroyeth (FT V.876). She values honor greatly, which can be seen by the fact that she decides she must keep her promise, but she also clearly values her love, because she is so distressed about the situation. The fact that it is actually an illusion, and the rocks are not actually gone, makes her distress even more poignant. The lady in Boccaccio's tale, however, immediately does not believe that Tarolfo has done what she asked, and calmly answers that it pleaseth me right well, ye shall let me see it to morowe (Boccaccio 10). When she does go see the garden, accompanyed with many others, she enjoys itthere is temperat aire, and she goes around gathering both hearbs and floures (Boccaccio 10). These are hardly the actions of a heartsick, distraught woman. She clearly values honor over love, because she tells Tarolfo ye have deserved me love, and I am ready to stand to my promise (Boccaccio 10); she only become upset about the prospect of having to leave her husband when she returns to her chamber. Without even looking at the husband's responses and the later actions of the stories, it is clear that Chaucer has introduced a powerful element of love in his story. Dorigen does consider killing herself to best preserve her honor, but ultimately does not do so, allowing for the possibility that her love might prevail. Her husband does not seem to consider love greater than honor, for he lets her go, and although he is very upset because he does love her, he is also extremely concerned with the own social appearances of their relationship. This concern seems to outweigh even Dorigen's lifehe forbids her to tell the situation to anyone, up peyne of deeth (FT V.1481). This element of love does perhaps tip the scale in answering the question of who is the most fre at the end in a way that the interpretation of liberalitie in Boccaccio is not affected. The answer to this question really comes down to the values of answerersis honor, love, or money most important? And if love is so important for Dorigen, then perhaps it is also for Aurelius, and for readers considering the characters. Aurelius is, indeed, a good manoon of the beste farynge men on lyve (FT V.932). His love for Dorigen, like Tarolfo's love for the gentlewoman, is enormous, with great good wil (Boccaccio 1). In viewing both tales from a literary standpoint, rather than from a consciousness of social class or an ethical standpoint, Aurelius and Tarolfo are perhaps the most important characters because of the change they undergo throughout the course of the story. They each begin with an extremely selfish desire for a woman who is happily married to another man, which leads them to pester her and do everything they can to try to twist her outrageous promise into something she actually has to keep. But this turns into an understanding of the love woman's love for her husband, and a realization that exhibiting generosity in unbinding the women from the contractone that they basically forced the women intois what will make each of them a good person and happiest in the end. The Queen in Boccaccio's version condemns Tarolfo's behavior, because the fact that he was being dishonorable before does not make him more noble than others when he begins to act as a good human being should. Yet this transition should not be condemned. He and Aurelius do suffer in working to find a way to meet the demands of their object of desire, and then once they finally achieve their goals, they almost immediately give it away for the happiness of others. They learn their lessons: Tarolfo learns how honorable a knight really is, and that he should also attempt to be so noble, and Aurelius learns that not only is the knight honorable, but the love bitwix (FT V. 1532) Arveragus and Dorigen is so strong that it would be dishonorable to disrupt it. The differences in these lessons point to the differing values of the tales. The women of both stories are also each taught a lesson, but it is overtly told to them, and not something they discover within themselves, as Aurelius and Tarolfo did. Those who articulate these lessons differ, however. Aurelius is the one to tell Dorigen, or perhaps just the audience in general, that promises are dangerous: But every wyf be war of hire biheeste! (FT V.1541). However, the knight in Boccaccio is the one to tell his wife to take ye better heed hereafter of such like, although a demanded gift may seeme unto you impossible to be had (Boccaccio 11). By articulating this, Boccaccio's knight is establishing his authority through his superior knowledge and understanding of interaction. But in Chaucer, Aurelius is demonstrating his own learning and self-discovery in reminding Dorigen of her mistake, and in warning others of a future mistake they might make. It becomes less of a reprimand when it comes from someone who himself has made a great moral mistake, but realized it and fixed it. The weight of this mistake really depends, however, on the validity or power of the oath, which is an issue in both versions of the tale. Before Dorigen makes her promise, she expresses in a sort of oath format that being unfaithful to her husband is not a possibility: By thilke God that yaf me soule and lyf, / Ne shal I nevere been untrewe wyf / In word ne werk, as fer as I have wit (FT V. 983-5). But her promise to Aurelius also seems to be in the language of an oath, although it begins with in pleye thus seyde she: (FT V.988). She makes her promise by the authority of heighe God above (FT V. 989), and ends with Have heer my trouthe, in al that evere I kan (FT V.998). And predating these two oaths is her original marriage oath. Which of these oaths reigns supreme? The characters in the story seem to conclude that the oath that is given the most recently has the most power. In Chaucer, there is no overt discussion of the actual lawfulness of this later oath that Dorigen gives after two other oaths confirming her loyalty to her husband. The question of lawfulness does become an issue in Il Filocolo. The gentlewoman's promise may be less of an oath, although she does say that if Tarolfo he completes what she wishes, she sware by her gods, and by that loyalty that ought to be in a gentlewoman, that she would accomplish al his desire (Boccaccio 2). However, the Queen says in her interpretation at the end of the tale that the wife could not justly make such an oth, without the will of her husband (Boccaccio 16), or if she did so, as the story shows her to have done, it was not lawful. So in this case, it actually turns out that the oath was non-binding, and the knight's act of giving his wife to Tarolfo just came from his own personal sense of honor. The knight and his lady's original marriage oath is here the most powerful. In the viewpoint of the queen in Boccaccio's story, the fact that the oath was not lawful makes the knight's actions even more honorable than they had been otherwise, because his personal honor extends beyond the law. This could also be interpreted as the knight acting very stupidly, and giving up more than is necessary in order to prove some inflated sense of honor. Because the question of lawfulness does not come up in Chaucer, the issue of which oath is more powerful goes along with the issue of which virtue is more valuedhonor or love. If love is the most valued, then Dorigen's love for her husband, represented by her marriage oath and claim that she will never be untrue to him, have more weight than her rash promise to Aurelius. If honor is more valued, then the fact is that technically Dorigen did make an oath the Aurelius, and must live with the consequences. Aurelius, who values love, ultimately realizes that if he truly does value love, he must honor the love between Dorigen and Arveragus. One character in both versions that does not have much connection with love or honor at all themselves are the clerk and magician that helped Aurelius and Tarolfo. Although Theban did perform actual magic, where the clerk just created an illusion, they both fulfilled the contract by doing what was asked of them. The clerk and Theban also both acknowledge the honorable actions being made by others, and the clerk in Chaucer's tale asserts his own generosity and level of nobility much more forcefully than Theban. Theban acknowledges how liberal the knight was to Tarolfo and how generous Tarolfo was to him in return, and sees it as simply his due to also be so generous. But he also puts himself into his place as a poor member of the lower class serving a knight when he says for above all things in the world it contenteth me, in that I have served thy turne (Boccaccio 13). He seems to not care about the money, which is not valued in this tale, and is happy to go back to his life of poverty and herb-collecting, a decision which the queen asserts is wise, because poverty is much calmer and safer than being rich (Boccaccio 19). The clerk in Chaucer, however, does not want to submit to the restrictions and stereotypes of a lower class. He says, Thou art a squier, and he is a knyght; / But God forbede, for his blisful myght, / But if a clerk koude doon a gentil dede, / As wel as any of yow, it is no drede! (FT V.1609-12). He is interested in being seen on the same level as the nobility in terms of his actions, as the Franklin himself is. There is no condemnation of the value of money or getting paid for completing a contract in the Franklin's Tale as there is in Boccaccio's tale. Indeed, since the Franklin is narrating his tale, Chaucer has him put his own agenda into the story. The tale ends with the Franklin questioning the audience about who they think is the mooste fre (FT V.1622), but is followed by no epilogue or prologue to another tale in which this question is discussed by the pilgrims. It is left completely open, up to interpretation and debate by the audience reading it, as it would have been up to debate among the pilgrims listening to it. It has no suggested interpretation in favor of the aristocrat-born characters. This level of openness fits well with the overall message coming from the beginning of the Canterbury Tales, starting from the Miller's Prologue, when Chaucer tells the audience, And therefore, whoso list it nat yheere, / Turne over the leef and chese another tale (MTPr I.317-8). Just as readers can choose to read in whatever order they want from these tales, of which today scholars are still uncertain of the exact intended ordering, they can choose who they think is the most fre, based on their own background and experience. Chaucer updates the story from Boccaccio's tale, which had some discussion provided at the end, but with a final conclusion in favor of honor. He makes it into something more progressive and asking for intelligent thought from readers. Comparing Chaucer's tale to Boccaccio's original makes apparent Chaucer's agenda and achievement.

ENG.G0.31.1,"Cursed Inheritances in Go Down, Moses",English,Report,"In Go Down, Moses, William Faulkner represents many different problems of inheritance. Complicating this inheritance is the conflict between the inheritance of land and the inheritance of knowledge that affects how one views said land and even how one views family history. Though Isaac disinherits the family land and largely separates himself from society, it is his own inability to disinherit the family secrets that drives him to relative isolation. For McCaslin, accepting ownership of the land is something he feels compelled to do despite the fact that he shares much of Isaac's knowledge about family history and actually witnessed slavery directly. As a child, Cass observes slavery firsthand under the tutelage of his uncles Buck and Buddy. It is his perspective which the reader sees in Was. The events that occur here are later recounted to Isaac by Cass, which is illustrative of the fact that Isaac receives information about slavery and his own family secondhand. It is also clear that Cass was raised to think of the land as his, as General Compson later remarks in The Bear that Cass has one foot straddled into a farm and the other foot straddled into a bank (Faulkner 240). He observes injustice and hardship and reacts in a pragmatic manner, realizing that nothing is to be gained by refusal of the family land despite its marred history. This is nearly the opposite of Isaac's eventual reaction, which sets up the cousins as representatives of two very different ethical ideals. It is clear that the relationship between Cass and Isaac is much different from that of typical cousins. Due to the age difference, McCaslin is more his brother than his cousin and more his father than either (158). Cass has clearly had a significant role in Isaac's upbringing in the absence of Isaac's own father. McCaslin brought him for the first time to the camp, the big woods, just as Cass himself was brought to the woods to learn about hunting and the wilderness from Sam Fathers (184). Cass's experience bears great resemblance to Isaac's experience on the face of it, but Cass is not nearly as affected by the bear or seeing the mystical buck as is Isaac. Isaac and McCaslin are both educated in nature by Sam Fathers, but for Isaac this contributes to his eventually refusal to accept the family land. He comes to believe that land cannot be owned; instead, land is something owned by God and shared by all. During his argument with McCaslin, he says the land was never [his] to repudiate (Faulkner 245). The importance of this moment is highlighted in the very first pages of the book, when Isaac is introduced as having given up his inheritance because the earth was no man's but all men's (4). It is here where a clear distinction is drawn between Isaac and McCaslin. They are juxtaposed not against the wilderness but against the tamed land which was to have been [Isaac's] heritage (243). Part of this juxtaposition results simply from an age difference. With regards to the turmoil following the Civil War, McCaslin had actually seen it, and the boy even at almost eighty would never be able to distinguish certainly between what he had seen and what had been told him (278). Because of his unique position, Isaac interprets nearly everything he sees and comes to his own conclusions about the past, whereas Cass is, from the beginning, more closely connected to his heritage. Though they both might have the same knowledge of the family secrets, Isaac has a clear, strong reaction, but it is not apparent that Cass reacts at all. This potential for shared knowledge is realized through the presence of the ledgers. It can be inferred that Cass may have tried to prevent Isaac from discovering them, as Isaac got the commissary key from McCaslin's room after midnight while McCaslin was asleep in order to read them (257). Isaac is always alone when he peruses the ledgers, as though he does not want McCaslin to know what he has discovered. This leads the reader to believe that Cass is aware of the dark family secrets revealed in the old record books, as it makes sense that this would be a secret he would want hidden from a sixteen-year-old Isaac. It would seem, however, that Cass is eventually aware that Isaac has knowledge of the ledgers' content. Isaac and Cass appear to have a mutual understanding of their shared knowledge of the history contained in the ledgers. The ledgers are referenced, albeit silently, several distinct times during their confrontation over the inheritance. Early on in the argument, the ledgers are mentioned as something neither Cass nor Isaac look towards, as though they are both familiar with the contents and thus do not need to pay them another glance (250). Later, McCaslin did not even say Look but merely lifted one hand, not even pointing, not even specifically towards the shelf of ledgers but towards the desk (279). This is finally connected to the land as a whole: McCaslin merely lifted one hand, not even speaking and not even toward the ledgers: so that, as the stereopticon condenses into one instantaneous field the myriad minutia of its scope, so did that slight and rapid gesture establish in the small cramped and cluttered twilit room not only the ledgers but the whole plantation in its mazed and intricate entirety  the land, the fields and what they represented&that whole edifice intricate and complex and founded upon injustice and erected by ruthless rapacity and carried on even yet with at times downright savagery&not only still intact but enlarged, increased; brought still intact by McCaslin (284-285). For both Cass and Isaac, the ledgers represent their entire family history, good and bad. This history is passed on in the very land itself, the ugliness living on through McCaslin and eventually his descendants. Cass seems to understand this history, to have an idea of exactly what information is contained in the ledgers, but if he does possess this knowledge it does not seem to affect him as it does Isaac. Accepting his heritage is what Cass sees as the ethical thing to do, not necessarily in spite of but perhaps because of his family history. The act of refusing the land for Isaac, however, represents his attempts to wash his hands of the family secrets. Isaac attempts to renounce his inheritance by not accepting the family land, but he cannot disinherit his own family history. Though his beliefs about nature and property clearly play into his refusal of his inheritance, it is also clear that Isaac is strongly affected by his reading of the ledgers. Though Isaac knows from his own observation and memory that there had already been some white in Tomey's Terrel's blood before his father gave him the rest of it, he is stricken by the actual evidence of this (259). He is not able to make peace with his grandfather Carothers McCaslin's horrific act of incest, but renouncing his inheritance does not erase this knowledge from his mind. The only thing his actions really accomplish is the elimination of the McCaslin surname from the plantation, as the family itself lives on through McCaslin Edmonds. This leads to the conclusion that, if this knowledge is shared by Cass, it is something he accepted and moved beyond, but this inherited secret proves to be the sticking point for Isaac. Cass and Isaac's different interpretations and reactions to family history are rooted in Cass's observations at the end of The Old People. Isaac is shamed by the actions of his family members, and shame is the one thing worse than not being alive (179). Isaac absorbs the family history and personalizes it, and is then so horrified by it that he must escape it. Cass, however, seems to believe that even the darkest moments cannot be hidden  he points to the seed, the acorns, at what happens even to carrion when you try to bury it: it refuses too, seethes and struggles too until it reaches light and air again (179). History will persist without the consent of either Cass or Isaac, and Cass is resigned to his familial duty in order to have a say in how this occurs. As a descendant of Carothers McCaslin, Cass sees himself as tied to both the legacy of the family and of the land itself. Despite the efforts made by Isaac to stop progress, his repudiation of the land means that this is not up to him. Only those who control the land can play a role in shaping it, and Cass is able to accomplish this to a certain extent by providing a house for Lucas and Mollie. It is Cass who is ultimately responsible for any progress, but unlike Isaac he does not necessarily see the perpetuation of the family line as shameful. Instead, he accepts his inheritance and does his best not to simply continue the family legacy but to improve it. In the end, however, because the family history is so tied to the land, Isaac cannot truly escape the legacy of the plantation or disinherit his family secrets, either. He is part of the curse of the South, which is something Cass appears to understand. Cass remarks, I am what I am; I will be always what I was born and have always been (286). They will always be connected to their family's former slaves, and though they might deny the truth in the end they must live with this knowledge. Isaac and Cass's very different reactions to the inheritance of the land highlight the problem of inherited knowledge. Cass, as a childhood witness to slavery, is able to accept the family land despite its curse. In some ways, Cass accepts the land because it is cursed, because he knows he is forever tied to the history of the plantation and thus cannot ethically refuse what is rightfully his. Isaac, who obtains most of his knowledge about slavery from Cass and Sam Fathers and his reading of the ledgers, has a more detached view of the subject. By virtue of his generational removal from family history, Isaac is more burdened by both his inheritance of land and his inheritance of family secrets. The overarching legacy of slavery which frames the novel as a whole is highlighted by Isaac's reaction. It is, finally, the inherited curse which perhaps cannot be overcome, no matter how hard future generations may try.

ENG.G0.31.2,Jack Zipes and Fairy Tales,English,Report,"For most Americans, Walt Disney's animated versions of fairy tales are the most familiar. In Breaking the Disney Spell, literature critic Jack Zipes defines Disney as both a revolutionary and an unfortunate interpreter of fairy tales. Zipes highlights Disney's successes and shortcomings as part of a larger discussion of the social implications of fairy tales and the idea of the child as the target audience. Zipes is generally a Marxist critic, focusing on the role literary fairy tales had in separating people by wealth and education status. For Zipes, fairy tales and folk tales reflect the values of a society, and his essay clearly demonstrates an attempt to place fairy tales within their social and historical context while specifically highlighting the effects of fairy tales as designed by Walt Disney. Zipes defines the folk tale as an oral story intended to explain natural occurrences and bring people together (333). This places the folk tale securely in the realm of the community, as stories are passed down from generation to generation without written record. In this way, storytelling was the product of communal efforts, and folk tales thus reflected the values of an entire society and provided a means to teach those values to children. The invention of the printing press and the rise of literary folk tales, Zipes argues, resulted in sanitized versions of traditional tales for children, although fairy tales were not deemed entirely appropriate for children until the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries (336). For a time, then, the printing press actually decreased the accessibility of fairy tales to children. Furthermore, these printed texts were generally accessible only to the wealthy (336). This resulted in an overall shift in how fairy tales were received and understood: We have already seen that one of the results stemming from the shift from the oral to the literary in the institutionalization of the fairy tale was a loss of live contact with the storyteller and a sense of community or commonality. This loss was a result of the social-industrial transformations at the end of the nineteenth century (341). What was once a oral, communal activity became more heavily focused upon the private realm, although oral traditions did continue to an extent (335). These two divergent traditions resulted in a greater social schism, as the literary fairy tale was reserved for the elite and the oral folk tale largely became a tradition of the lower classes. As Zipes argues, however, industrialization itself was not completely negative, as literary rates spread and the standard of living generally improved (341). Still, Zipes maintains that there was a significant difference between the two traditions. Part of Zipes's argument relies on the supposition that there was a great thematic difference between oral folk tales and literary fairy tales. The ruling classes, who printed and read fairy tales, could instill notions of elitism and separatism through a select canon of tales geared to children who knew how to read (337). This argument holds in the sense that the tales as read by children were cleaned up by editors like the Brothers Grimm, while the oral tales retained much of their original darkness. What is not clear, however, is whether this sanitation resulted in vastly different moral and social lessons. It would seem, though, that social and industrial changes resulted in a shifting purpose for fairy tales. No matter the overall content, the fairy tale has evolved alongside technology. Zipes argues that technology was the fuel for Walt Disney's reinvention of the fairy tale, and with that reinvention came a new set of functions and moral lessons. Zipes praises Disney as a revolutionary, someone who dared to carve new paths in the worlds of both animation and fairy tales (343). Disney reinterpreted fairy tales and played into the core of American mythology, as is evident through his use of the infantile quest (345). Because he brought fairy tales to the masses through the use of animation, fairy tales could once more be enjoyed by children, and in the decades since Disney's first film, fairy tales have been reinstated firmly in the realm of children's entertainment. For Disney, the story of Snow White presented many opportunities to present his own ideas about what America should be. Unlike the prince in the source material, Disney's Prince frames the overall narrative (349). It is the Prince who demonstrates the values of valor and wealth and who emerges as the hero who saves Snow White (350). Snow White herself is heavily domesticated, a perfect example of femininity for scores of young female viewers. Snow White also reflects the time period in which it was made, as the seven dwarfs exemplify the work ethic and American spirit that would be necessary for recovery from the Great Depression. Zipes does criticize Walt Disney's focus on the commercial prospects of fairy tales. Zipes discusses Disney's refusal to credit his animators, a sign that he always needed to be in charge and put his own stamp on his projects. Disney also used technology not to fully reinstate the fairy tale as a story of the community, but rather to highlight his own ingenuity and spread his own messages about gender roles and the importance of maintaining a patriarchal society (352). Because of this, Disney was not quite successful in returning the fairy tale to the realm of the community. Though his stories could be viewed by the masses, they retained many of the same value messages as the earlier literary fairy tales. Jack Zipes argues that fairy tales should be accessible to everyone, especially children, but his desire that fairy tales should not unnecessarily stratify society leads to his complex evaluation of Walt Disney. Disney's interpretations of fairy tales, though innovative, are not completely successful in Zipes's opinion, as they reinforce ideas of patriarchy, social status, and gender roles that have little place in our modern world.

ENG.G0.33.1,Limited Recovery: Trauma in Obejas' Cuban America,English,Report,"I have done that, says my memory. I cannot have done that, says my pride, and remains adamant. At last  memory yields. -Friedrich Nietzsche Juani Las Casas exhibits many trademark symptoms associated with trauma victims. Comparing her narrative with a more general psychological account of victims' responses is useful: it gives us a guiding light into some of Juani's more perplexing behavior, and it offers forth a tried-and-true solution for healing. Yet, looking at Juani's trauma reveals more than just a simple cause and effect relationship between events in her life and her respective emotional responses. We get an incredibly troubling picture of Cuban-American life as deeply pathological, perhaps insurmountably so for an individual like Juani who, one would assume, wants to heal and move on. Jimmy, who's arguably the perpetrator of trauma against Juani, is not just a one-dimensional villain. Though his childhood makes him no less morally culpable for any of his actions, his back story inspires some degree of sympathy  or, if not sympathy, then understanding  for his abuses. He, too, is, in a way, a trauma victim. The problem for Juani, like any trauma victim, is that she must find some semblance of moral solidarity before she can make amends with her trauma. Unfortunately, the majority of the Cuban-in-exile culture offers little sympathy for her plight, with the perhaps-satisfactory exception of her cousin, Patricia Trauma victims behave predictably, engaging in behavior that, throughout psychology's history, has been deemed madness or hysteria. In the late 19th century, Freud and Janet undertook, in a scientific manner, to understand why women were acting out, at seemingly random times, extreme versions of fear, irritability, helplessness, memory loss, and alterations of normal physiological functions.1 The two found overwhelming evidence that certain traumatic events had, in a way, triggered the hysteria. Often, in the case of women, the trauma was associated with sexual violations perpetrated by men.2 Both Freud and Janet began to realize that, following a traumatic sexual encounter, a process of personality splitting  or as Janet termed it, dissociation  occurred. The logic of dissociation is as follows: after a traumatic event, the traumatized victim is unable to comprehend, or to keep intact in a normal state of consciousness, the memories and feelings of the trauma.3 That is, the trauma is so overwhelming, that the victim must compartmentalize and set aside the feelings in a separate consciousness, or an unconscious. Freud wrote that the origin of all psychopathologies lies in the contents of the unconscious, or that part of our soul  if you will  that is split apart from our normally developing and maturing self.4 One can think of it like a rotting piece of meat hidden in a closet with small vents; the meat's stench will, for the most part, go unnoticed, but with a large enough gust of wind, the vents will allow forth wafts of the stench. And as time goes on, the meat's stench gets worse and worse, though it is still hidden. The therapist's job, according to psychological dictate, is to uncover the rot  to bring it out into the light so the individual can realize what has been causing the stench. Leaving this somewhat putrid metaphor behind, we see that what Freud and his contemporaries realized is that by unearthing trauma, by putting the traumatic narrative into words, patients' hysterical symptoms were alleviated.5 Later in the 20th century, social workers working with ex-soldiers from World War II and Vietnam came to the same conclusion.6 Putting into words the trauma narrative, however, does not exorcise the trauma; rather, it is to come to grips with the trauma's reality, and to reintegrate it into the individual's life narrative. By accepting the traumatic narrative, it is no longer relegated to the dark portions of consciousnesses, and is no longer able to wreak the same unpredictable and destructive effects as before.7 (Thus, the meat metaphor is a bit inept, for in order to heal requires acceptance of the trauma  or rot  into one's conscious life, and surely no one would like to accept rotten meat as a reality. Most would throw it out, which is not the therapeutic goal.) However, victims often prevent themselves the benefit of healing out of pride. Such is the case, it seems, for Juani Las Casas. The evidence of Juani's trauma is not only spelled out in the reiteration of her violent encounter with Gina, but is all-too-evident in her problematic behavior after the fact. After the violence  or incident, as her relatives call it  Jimmy's fabricated story denies Juani the cathartic experience of truth-telling. Of course, she always could have told the truth, yet she recognizes the comfort entailed in lying: In my own way, I relished the lies, and I was secretly relieved to not be responsible to them. 8 Yet, why should this be comfortable? Herman writes that not only does speaking about trauma force the witness to share in pain 9(and so Juani may believe she is actually protecting her family), but more importantly, when it occurs to an already-devalued person, such as a woman or child, speaking about the trauma is outside of socially accepted reality. To make the trauma public is unacceptable, and therefore, the traumatic narrative becomes unspeakable.10 For Juani, this is further evidenced by the interaction she has with her mother when, almost pleadingly, she tries to prepare her mother for the fact that Jimmy's story is a lie. Don't torture yourself with this & there are some things that are better left unspoken, 11Mami says. With her mother, the figure in one's life who is said to be the most understanding and nurturing, Juani has no real outlet to share her pain. In fact, Mami actually recommends that Juani bottle up her feelings, as though this were the more healthy way of coping. The fact is, Juani doesn't feel at ease enough with any of her family members, at least initially. She considers herself an outsider to her own blood.12 Thus, Juani, denied the ability to represent her trauma in words, begins to develop what therapists would consider to be symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. After the violence, she writes that I was incapable of focusing on anything, and so jumpy I was constantly startled, constantly irritated. 13 In a moment of rancor, she assails her mother for her supposed falsification of the cinta magnetica story. Even the language of the descriptions implies a sort of violence  the words like bullets piercing my mother. 14 Though, for Nena and Bernie, the phone conversation could have been mistaken as a bout of purposeless malice, psychological theory may have it otherwise: Traumatic events call into question basic human relationships. They breach the attachments of family, friendship, love, and community. They shatter the construction of the self that is formed and sustained in relation to others & she often comes into conflict with important people in her life. There is a rupture in her sense of belonging within a shared system of belief.15 So, the bullets of her speech are not aimed at Mami's feelings; rather they are the symbolic destruction of whatever attachment she had to her mother's values. This conversation, less of an outright attack, is more of a symbolic measure of distancing herself from her mother who she believes, like everyone else in the family, is a liar.16 The fight is a way for Juani to prove to herself that her healing and satisfaction with truth will not arrive through her mother. Another obvious sign of Juani's PTSD symptoms is the moment when she realizes that she has confused her own understanding of the violence with Gina. Having kept a journal as a way of recording her personal narrative, she discovers that she has begun to insert fragments of Jimmy's lie into her journal. The journal, which is nearly an analogue of a therapist  it is a safe spot to record her unmediated thoughts without consequence  somehow becomes tainted. Yet, this is not a surprising event for a trauma victim. While denying reality may seem crazy to both an outsider and to the victim herself, facing reality can be more difficult. Trauma victims often present inconsistent or factually incorrect versions of their trauma narrative either to themselves or to others as a way of coping with the unthinkable.17 Fragmented stories or notions of reality are functions of dissociative disorders. It's easy to imagine that any victim of trauma or suffering would prefer to live in an artificial or imaginary world  prisoners, sexual abuse victims, and holocaust survivors alike. Better that than live with reality. From all of her psychological and emotional suffering, it would seem easy for the outsider to say to Juani, You have suffered, and many others have suffered, and you must do what is necessary to heal; you must come clean with your story to a therapist, or whomever else would offer a safe place to speak the truth, and begin your life again in acceptance of truth. Yet, as Herman notes, it's not only the immediate people around you who dictate whether it is socially valid to verbalize the trauma. Politics and their associated gendered structures of power, too, constrain individuals from seeking help and verbalizing their trauma narratives.18 In Freud's time, women were ridiculed for telling the truth about their suffered abuses, and because of this, often kept quiet.19 War veterans, too, presumably fearing emasculation among their veteran peers, kept quiet. Yet, certain political movements have, throughout recent history, begun to legitimize speaking about these traumas. With the powerful anti-war movement in the 1970s, veterans' psychological trauma became an acceptable public discourse. The political movement gave legitimacy not only to sufferers to voice their trauma, but to the field of mental health, which became less constrained by social norms to continue developing and researching healing methods.20 Unfortunately, the Cuban-American political climate that Juani faces is not hospitable to open gayness. As Bernie says, The independista movement doesn't do well with lesbian and gay issues & they just think homosexuality's a product of a capitalist society. This attitude is one to which Gina adheres, as well. She considers sexual identity to be a white, capitalist-bourgeois construction, unworthy of contemplation alongside any human concerns. She even goes so far as to accuse Juani  and all of the Cubans in America  of wanting to be white.21 What begins as an attack on her sexuality ends with a sweepingly prejudiced statement about nationality and ethnicity. These political-sexual divisions underlay much of the tension in the scene right before their quarrel, as perhaps Obejas is trying to persuade us that ideology and politics are an insurmountable obstacle to love. Perhaps perhaps is too light of a word, as Juani says it herself: I know all too well how the world of politics, with its promises and deceptions, its absolute values and impersonal manifestos, can cut through the deepest love and leave lovers stranded. 22 Yet, if making amends (or failing to) with both her own Cuban culture's homophobia and her lover's homophobia is a struggle, Juani is subject to a much larger and more grotesque set of prejudices in Jimmy. Jimmy is an interesting character, for he engenders both Cuban machismo and Americanized anti-Cubanisms. Jimmy, like Juani, is an outsider  both to mainstream white Americans and to the Cuban immigrants.23 His identity lies somewhere in the void between the two, giving him his distanced Frankstein-like personality. Unlike Juani, who, though suffering, is able to come to recognize and accept her outsider status, Jimmy spends energy trying to compensate for his lack of a regular upbringing. As Juani's father begins anew on his duct tape tale, Jimmy listens attentively, as though listening to his own father, and consumes the story without doubt.24 Perhaps it is only a kind or ingratiating gesture, but from what the Las Casas sisters presume, Jimmy is, in fact, trying to find a paternal figure. For all of his efforts to fit in, to find a surrogate, ethnically appropriate father, it seems that Jimmy's hostility toward Juani is born out of bitterness; bitterness because she has had the luxury to be born into her own culture and customs, yet, perhaps as he sees it, she throws them away and opts for her own outsider status. This would explain the pathological power dynamic between the two of them. Their relationship is one which could be characterized as an unpublicized war: That first time she left us alone in the living room & Jimmy just sat there on the couch and stared at me, his legs wide open, his hand rubbing his dick & it was like a stand-off. 25 Throughout the novel, Jimmy mixes aggression with overt male sexuality, in a way that's suggestive of a certain machismo dominance. The penis becomes a symbolic weapon that he uses to threaten Juani, at one point simultaneously stroking himself and ordering her not to visit Caridad anymore.26 The stiff phallus become synonymous with his intimidating physical violence, sending Juani the message that should she disobey him, she will await a crime much worse than anything he inflicts on his wife. In one scene, Obejas juxtaposes his overly macho intimidation technique in the laundry shop with his receiving a letter from his cousin  his blood family for whom he shows very little sympathy or care. At one moment, we have the simultaneous over-the-top display of machismo and a melancholy reminder of his fractured past. Obejas may use this juxtaposition to indicate that Jimmy's mixture of violence and sexuality is a pathological stand-in for a (lack of) personal and national identity. In a way, his pathologies suggest a profound trauma in childhood, one which is understandable given his lack of biological parentage. However, his trauma is not self-suffered. Jimmy's pathologies precipitate the coercive oppression he inflicts on Juani, binding her to her own trauma, too. This aforementioned bitterness he feels toward her manifests in the faux-protective fabrication he doles out to the unsuspecting family members. His behavior indicates a sort of war of trauma victims  as though by chaining Juani to an inescapable silence, he has a claim to victory, not to mention a falsely inflated ego predicated on the belief that he has saved her. His behavior matches up with how Herman describes the traditional behavior of the persecutor: In order to escape accountability for his crimes, the perpetrator does everything in his power to promote forgetting. 27 Like the Nazis burning their evidence of the concentration camps, Jimmy prevents the true story from reaching the concerned family ears. The power to control both what others believe and what Juani, pathologically, comes to believe for herself in her journal, is indeed a formidable power. Additionally, Jimmy's power is one which stunts Juani's ability to heal. Trauma already strips the victim of her sense of self-control28, but Jimmy's maneuverings go even further, stripping her of self-knowledge and making it impossibly difficult to tell the already-difficult truth to her family. The novel's final scene is troubling because of it's content; it's also troubling because it seems to suggest that Juani's release from self-captivity  her freedom to make amends with Gina and finally come out with the truth to Titi (and surely Patricia, too)29  can only come at the expense of Jimmy's being beaten. Whether Jimmy's beating is merely correlated to her renewed sense of self, or whether it actually causes it is a moot point. What's important to note is the disturbing idea that Obejas presents, that only through an act of extreme violence to the oppressor will trauma's yoke release. Psychotherapists would have it otherwise, claiming that the revenge fantasy is an empty joy. No trauma victim, according to theory and practice, would be able to have a sudden turnaround from self-dispossession to moderate serenity after been witness to more violence. Retaliation against the perpetrator does not move the victim along a healing path. Healing starts with regaining a sense of safety, moving to the acceptance of remembering and mourning, and finally to the point of reconnecting with ordinary life.30 It's a dire, if not psychologically refutable way to envision violence as the first step to heal traumatic wounds. Perhaps, however, the novel does not end on some kind of polar-good or bad note. The tone certainly projects a sense of mild warmth, of limited happiness. It looks toward healing, rather than suggesting that healing has already occurred. In fact, Juani takes one of the very first steps toward recovery: drafting the trauma narrative, literally, to her aunt. Gina, too, provides closure for Juani, apparently having already achieved some limited version of it for herself.31 But we're left with a vision of Cuban-American culture that's deeply troubling. The vision may extend to all cultures-in-exile in America, of which there are many, and may explain some of the subtle pathologies that permeate the American social fabric. It's not only Jimmy, whose not-so-unique childhood leaves him in a traumatic vacuum, out of which arises violent pathologies. No, throughout the novel we encounter numerous examples of hysteria. Juani's father, Gina explains, is delusional simply from being an exile. He, like Juani, vacillates in his stories, appearing crazy to outsiders to the point that they're incredulous, laughing inside the entire time 32 that he speaks. It seems that he suffers from the same dissociative symptoms, his skewed reality a stand-in for the trauma of having lost his homeland. While reflecting on the fact that her father prefers to ignore her troubling outsider sexual identity rather than face the truth, she says that his preference for lies is representative of the whole family's preferences.33 What we see is a collective dissociation. This means that an entire group of people, unwilling to face reality's pains, lives in an artificial reality. Janet and Freud saw that, on an individual level, people tended to act out in extremely pathological ways after dissociation had occurred; yet, what would this mean for an entire group living in a dissociated state? Obejas doesn't answer the question in a rigorous, academic/sociological way, but rather shows us a family and its friends, torn apart at times by acts of horrendous violence, political disputes, memory lapses, and disagreements about what really is or was reality. Even more troubling is to think, at least for a moment, about the fact that the novel begins in the present tense after Juani's trauma has already occurred. This presents some challenges to narrative authenticity, for she already admits that her journal's reality had become blurred. What other parts of the novel, as a whole, could have become disfigured by unreality? And who are we really to trust? The only satisfying answer to the question is found in the text itself. When Juani asks Nena how she has explained the family's stories to Bernie, Nena replies, Well, I just tell Bernie what's true for me & and that there are varying stories. To assume that there is no concrete truth to which individuals can refer, however, is indeed a troubling picture for classic psychoanalysis.

ENG.G0.34.2,The Words of Love Between Us: The Covenant in Hosea,English,Report,"The book of Hosea reaffirms the first word of the covenant between God and Israel at Sinai: I am YHWH your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery; you shall have no other gods besides me(Ex 20:2-3). At a time when the Assyrian empire is threatening like a flood to overwhelm them, and they are desperately thinking of ways to save themselvesturning to other gods, making covenants with other peoplesHosea urges the people of Israel to remember that they are YHWH's people, and his alone, and as such they are to look to no other for deliverance. He reaches back to the book of Exodus to find a time when, according to the view of this text, Israel truly knew YHWH. In what's seen as a wooing of Israel the bride by YHWH the bridegroom, the God in Hosea will call his people back into the wildernessa state of total dependence upon God, and a place in which the people entered into a covenant with their God after he freed them from slaveryso that they may come to know him anew before returning to the land, a theme which would touch the hearts of those later listeners who were exiled in Babylon: Therefore, I will now allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak tenderly to her. From there I will give her her vineyards, and make the Valley of Achor a door of hope. There she shall respond as in the days of her youth, as at the time when she came out of the land of Egypt. (Hos2:14-15) Through this conceit, he recasts the first word of the covenant as a call to an exclusive love relationship with God/YHWH. This idea of the covenant as a marriage is of profound importance to Hosea, as he urges the people to come to truly know YHWH. For just as in Exodus, the source of the obligation to monogamy is the God's declaration of who he is, and how they are to know him: I am YHWH your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery [&] Hosea's God is a God who loves, and a God who frees; he is YHWH, he is their God, and he is the one who set them free. And so Israel's obligations to her God are not those of a slave to a master; rather, they are the obligations of love, the promises of the marriage covenant which she entered into with the God who freed her, and who promised her steadfast love. So in the wilderness of Hosea, just as in the wilderness of Exodus, God tries to break the slave mentality which 400 years of bondage in Egypt put upon the heart of Israel; he urges the people to imagine themselves as free (Williams lecture, 2-11). In the book of Hosea, this means even urging the people to see their relationship with him in a new light, or rather one long forgotten, to be sought and found anew. That is, the book of Hosea appeals to the people of Israel, not only to put away their worship of other gods, but to find a new understanding of their relationship with their own God, YHWH. And this new understanding is to be found in the names by which they are to know him: On that day, says YHWH, you will call me, 'Ishi' (my man, my husband) and no longer will you call me, 'Baali' (my master, my Baal.) (Hos 2:16) The change of names here reflects a whole new experience of the relationship with God on Israel's part; it expresses the new way in which she is to know himas husband, and not as master. Both names have layers of meaning which beg each to be given a closer look. First, Baal. On the surface, it is the name of the Canaanite god whose worship in the northern kingdom Israel is the very adultery for which God punishes her, withdrawing from her the fruits of the land, and later sweeping her away. For in the marriage metaphor of this text, to worship other gods is to know other lovers, and to not know YHWH at all. And so to come to a true understanding of their relationship with YHWH, they must first put away all foreign gods. God goes on to say: For I will remove the names of the Baalim from her mouth, and they shall be mentioned by name no more (Hos 2:17). That is to say, with the removal of the name Baal, Baal will be forgotten, just as YHWH was forgotten when Israel called upon other lovers1. The loss of the names of the Baals reflects the loss of Israel's knowledge of them, just as when sometime lovers drift apart, and the once familiar names rust upon the tongue. But the name works even further within the marriage metaphor. For it is not just a matter of which god Israel knows, YHWH or Baal; it is even a matter of what name Israel knows her God by within their own relationship. God's words are: ""You will call me 'My Ish,' and no longer will you call me, 'My Baal'(Hos 2:16). This clearly seems to say that Israel knew God/YHWH as Baal, and called him by that name; and YHWH wants nothing of it. This brings one to the inner layer of meaning of the name Baal, the meaning it has within the relationship between YHWH and his people. Baal can colloquially mean husband, just like ish. But its literal meaning is master, and it can never be wholly severed from its connotations with this servant-lord relationship, not any more than it can be from its connotations with the worship of foreign gods. It would seem then that God, in removing the name of Baal from their mouths, is given to reject this idea of the relationship between him and his people, and to urge them to look upon it with new eyes. It would seem that God is urging his people to see him not as a master in servitude, but as a partner in love. And so they are to call him Ish; and the name holds memories. It calls to mind the story of the first moment shared between the first man and woman in the world, the first husband and wife. In that moment, the man joyously named himself ish in relation to ishshah, because he saw that she was taken out of him, and of his same being2. The names were set up as a memorial to that original bond, for which reason men in all ages are said to leave their father and mother, and cleave to their wife in marriage so as to become one flesh3. This is what is established as the original relationship between man and woman/husband and wife, before the breaking of the first covenant with the taste of the forbidden fruit, before their experience of the world and of each other was changed, before the woman was doomed to be subject to the husband she desires4. So it would seem that, in causing Israel to no longer call him Baal, and instead to call him Ish, God is even urging the people to rediscover for themselves the original meaning of the relationship between Ish and Ishshah, the way the first man and woman knew each other before the breaking of covenant, and then to apply it to their relationship with God. And the people will express this found-again knowledge of their relationship with God by calling him Ishi, my husband, instead of Baali, my husband/lord. The echoes of Genesis continue: God is next given to say that he will make a covenant for his people on that day with all the other living creatures, and that he will abolish violence from the land5. The language brings to mind the original state of the world as it was imagined by the author of Genesis 1, a state wherein there was no violence between any creatures with the breath of life, and all was very good 6. Then, his next words are stunning: And I will take you for my wife forever; I will take you for my wife in righteousness and in justice, in steadfast love, and in mercy. I will take you for my wife in faithfulness; and you shall know YHWH. (Hos 2:19-20) In response to her awareness of him as her husband, which she acknowledges by calling him Ishi, God takes Israel as his wife; the covenant between the people and the other living creatures in the land is followed by a covenant of love between the people and their God. She has answered his wooing; and now he answers her appeal to him as Ishi. The language is that of the covenant; but here the covenant at Sinai is seen anew as a marriage vow, with both sides affirming their acceptance of the other's love, and taking on the dutiesfaithfulness, righteousness, steadfast loveowed to the other. And then, the marriage is to be consummated: You shall know YHWH (Hos 2:20). Know here is a stunning word. For in the context of marriage, it takes on a particular meaning. To know someone in this sense is to enter into the most intimate relationship with them that two persons can. Elsewhere in the Hebrew Bible, it describes the very act of conjugal union in which a man cleaves to his wife such that the two become one flesh. It is used thus for the first time in Genesis 4:1, when it is said: Now Adam knew his wife Eve, and she conceived and bore Cain [&] So in this God is given to make a great affirmation of the dignity of his human partner Israel; you can and will know YHWH your God in the most personal and intimate way possible. The assertion that Israel can and will enter into this relationship with God hangs wholly upon the use of the divine name here. It completes the affirmation of the people's knowledge of God; for they are to know him once again as YHWH, by his personal name, which he gave them when he brought them out of slavery in Egypt and into the wilderness to make covenant with them. Just as with human lovers, this relationship of mutual knowledge bears fruit and blessings. Out of that intimate knowledge springs new life, and that new life is the children, just as in Gen 4:1. Here the three children of IsraelJezreel, Lo-ruhamah, and Lo-ammiare adopted by God through a renaming, as he undoes the names which he gave them before7: On that day I will answer, says YHWH, I will answer the heavens and they shall answer the earth; and the earth shall answer the grain, the wine, and the oil, and they shall answer Jezreel; and I will sow him for myself in the land. And I will have pity on Lo-ruhamah, and I will say to Lo-ammi, ""You are my people""; and he shall say, ""You are my God."" (Hos 2:21-23) God's acceptance of the children of Israel, acknowledged through this renaming of them, is symbolic of a return to the blessed state in the land. The children will call, and God will answer through the land and the forces of nature which bring forth life. The name of Jezreel, not even changed, is reinterpreted. Before, it was given by God to be a memory of the site of Jehu's rebellion against the house of Ahab, king of Israel, a thing which, in the view of this text, is a cause for punishment by God8. Now the name, taken for its literal meaning, God sows, is to be a sign of the newly recovered fertility of the land, and a promise by God to once again establish them in the land as his chosen portion: I will sow him for myself in the land. Lo-ruhamah, the unpitied, unloved, becomes Ruhamah (pitied) once more; and Lo-ammi, not my people, becomes Ammi (my people) again, just as in Hosea 2:1. Through this renaming, the children whom God before called children of whoredom become the legitimate children of God and Israel, the fruit of their common love. So in this conception, the fruit of Israel's recovered knowledge of YHWH is a return to the blessed state in the land. The marriage metaphor is complete, as Israel's children are blessed in the knowledge of YHWH, and become his own; now that they truly know YHWH as YHWH, they can return to the land once more. God's acceptance of the children is answered by their acceptance of him in the final vows to belong to one another: You are my people; you are my God. This call and answer is the sum of Hosea's interpretation of Exodus: the covenant at Sinai was so many words of love between Israel the bride and YHWH the groom, marriage vows exchanged in the wilderness. Hosea urges the people of Israel to remember that YHWH is their God, the God who set them free, who brought them out of slavery in Egypt and into the wilderness because he loved them. The ideal relationship between God and his people, then, is one not of servitude, but of mutual knowledge, as of a man and a woman in marriage; and the fruit of that knowledge is a return to the original blessed state in the land, and the original blessed state of Israel's relations with God.

ENG.G0.34.3,Names of God and Man,English,Report,"The authors of Genesis 1 and 2, whoever they may be, share a deep interest in names and their origins. In fact, many of the stories in this book seem to have come about from a deep contemplation on certain names. This kind of creation from philology is reflected in the conceit of God's naming, beginning in Genesis 1. There, names are creative; they establish the nature of things. The stories of Man's naming, however, which begin in Genesis 2, clearly present the opposite relationship, in which names follow the nature of things. Because this is so, we the readers can actually observe the workings of Man's mind in the process of naming. That is, we can see why the man gives the names that he does. This is precisely because for Man, naming is an expression of his concrete knowledge of the nature of a thing, especially as it relates to his own nature as a human being. So we can see the man's experience of the world in the names that he gives to express that experience. Now what Man's experience of himself is at this point is a silent spot in the text. We the readers are told that the LORD God formed man (adam) from the dust of the ground (adamah) (Gen 2:7). But we are not told whether the man is aware of himself as adam, or when this self-awareness comes about. This raises a number of questions: what does the man know of himself at this point? What has God told him of himself, if anything? Does the man know what he is, and what it means to be Man? The text simply does not give us the answers right out. But what it does give us is a story of Man's naming of himself. In this story, God first invites Man to take part in the process of naming all the other living beings: So out of the ground the LORD God formed every animal of the field and every bird of the air, and brought them to the man to see what he would call them; and whatever the man called every living creature, that was its name (Gen 2:19). This invitation is the hinge between God's naming in Genesis 1 and Man's in Genesis 2, the two forming a sort of diptych, set against one another to show both how they are like, and how they are unlike. Let us first return then to God's naming, so as to put Man's naming in its proper context. In Genesis 1, by giving a name to each thing, God makes it what it is, the way it is and no other. One can take, for example, God's creation of light: Then God said, 'Let there be light'; and there was light (Gen 1:3). Here, the creation is in the giving of the name, light. The moment God puts a name to the idea of light, it becomes a reality; the moment he speaks the word light, light comes to be. God's naming in Genesis 1 is distinctive as well as creative. God distinguishes between the natures of things by giving them different names, thus ordering the world. Immediately after bringing light to be with a word, God makes a distinction in nature between the new-made light and the already existing darkness: And God saw that the light was good; and God separated the light from the darkness. God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night [&] (Gen 1:4-5). The statements are parallel, and seem to describe the same action. God separates the light from the darkness by calling the light Day, and the darkness Night; the act of giving different and distinct names is the very act of separating the two things. In this very first act of Genesis, God's effective namingcreating and ordering the worldsets the stage for Man's naming in Genesis 2 and beyond by establishing the bond between name and nature, as determined in the act of creation. With this fresh in mind, one turns to the second creation story in Genesis 2, in which it is Man that does the naming. Here it is important to note that God will create the living beings, but Man will name them. Also, Man's participation in the naming process is directly related to his loneliness and lack of a partner; the issue bookends the episode in which Man names the animals: Then the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a helper as his partner. So out of the ground the LORD God formed every animal of the field and every bird of the air, and brought them to the man to see what he would call them; and whatever the man called every living creature, that was its name. The man gave names to all cattle, and to the birds of the air, and to every animal of the field; but for the man there was not found a helper as his partner. (Gen 2:18-20) So it would seem that God invites the man to take part in the naming process precisely to let him find for himself the answer to his loneliness; the process of naming all the living beings will be, for the man, a search for something like himself, for a helper as his partner (Gen 2:19,20). Here the man, like God in Genesis 1, distinguishes between the kinds of animals according to their distinct natures. But unlike the names God gives, Man's names do not determine their natures; rather, they are an expression of an awareness on Man's part of distinctions in naturedistinctions already established by God in the act of creation. God creates, Man classifies. The names the man gives to the animals seem to be rather arbitrary: the text simply says, whatever the man called every living creature, that was its name (Gen 2:19). There is not presented in the text any particular reason for giving whatever names he does, any particular relation between the sound and the sense. But the truth that the man is recognizing is not revealed in the names taken individually; the truth about their natures as he knows them is revealed simply in the difference in the names in relation to one another. That is to say, the man expresses his recognition of their different natures by giving them different names. Far the most important distinction the man makes in his naming of the animals is that between all other living beings and himself. This text seems to conceive that Man cannot identify himself except in the presence of another of his own kind. So the man, not yet in the presence of this other self, begins the process of self-identification by recognizing what is not like him: The man gave names to all cattle, and to the birds of the air, and to every animal of the field; but for the man (adam) there was not found a helper as his partner (Gen 2:20). This awareness of himself as different from the other creatures is expressed by a non-identification: Man does not yet name himself during this process. This is precisely because for the man there was not found a helper as his partner (Gen 2:20). At this point, the man has recognized distinctions between each kind of animal, expressed in the different names he gives them, and between all other animals and himself, expressed by his lack of a name. But he has not yet found something like him in the world; he has not yet recognized himself, his own humanity, in any other living being. And so Man has not yet named himself. This will only come upon the creation of the woman, the partner the man has been wanting. The creation of the woman from the man immediately followsboth sequentially and logicallythe man's classification of the animals, in which he failed to find a partner like him. It is in some ways the crowning act of God's creation in this story, in that it completes the creation of the human being, begun with the creation of the man in Genesis 2:7, and spanning the creation of all other living things. It is certainly the most important moment in the man's life, which has been incomplete without the woman: his loneliness, for which the woman is found to be the only answer, God himself declares to be not good (Gen 2:18). The creation of the woman will lead to the man's joyous affirmation of what is human, expressed in a twin naming: This at last is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; this one shall be called Woman (Ishshah), for out of Man (Ish) this one was taken. (Gen 2:23) In naming himself, now distinctly ish with the presence of ishshah, he first recognizes the essential likeness between the two of them: This at last is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh [&] (Gen 2:23). That is, he recognizes that they share the same being. Then he expresses this awareness in the names he gives. And here he makes a master stroke; for he makes a subtle distinction in naming which recognizes their difference while preserving their essential likeness, giving different yet related names. The names express the man's new self-awareness, and his knowledge of the relationship between male and female as established in God's creation of the woman from the man. They become memorials of this original bond between them: ishshah and ish, like yet unlike, dual yet complementary, together making up humanity, otherwise incomplete. Every time one hears ish and ishshah, one is reminded of the integrity of man and woman. Man's naming here reaches a sublime level. The extraordinary care with which the man names the woman and himself in relation to one another reveals a man who has fully realized his linguistic potential: in fitting the sound of the two words to the true nature of the bond between them, the man comes as close as Man can to the language of God, that language of Genesis 1 in which the nature was established by the name. For the correspondence, the play between the sounds of the words, realizes the nature of the original bond between the man and the woman. Just as the man's life is incomplete without the woman, so the name ish has no meaning except in relation to ishshah. That is, the truth that these names memorialize is not to be found in either name taken alone; the truth is found in the aural likeness of the two. Here is established the concept of Man's naming which echoes throughout Genesis and beyond: names follow the nature of things. At this point, Man's words, the names that he gives, are direct reflections upon the nature of the world as he experiences it, as he lives it every day. Thus the natural bond between their bodies, relived each time a man and woman have sex1, is reflected in the names ishshah and ish (Gen 2:24). Thus does Man's naming approach that of God, though without quite reaching it. Man will continue to give names as he comes to know new realities. When the man learns about the process of childbirth in Genesis 3apparently for the first timehe calls his wife Eve, living, because she was the mother of all living (Gen 3:20). When Eve first brings forth a son, when childbirth becomes a part of her reality, she names him Cain, seen as related to the word qanah, to beget, saying I have begotten a man with the help of the LORD (Gen 4:1). And so it goes, and a pattern is established. Behind every name, there is a story of origins; names themselves are compact stories, unfolded in the pages of Genesis. These names, then, become memorials. They are set up as Man comes to know himself and the world around him, which he is given to order. Naming itself is a reminder of Man's position in the world, and his relation to other living beings and to God. For naming is something that God and Man share; but Man's naming is dependent upon God's. God makes the world the way it is, what it is and no other, by naming; Man names this world to express his experience of it, and to remember.

ENG.G0.36.1,Stephen's Deconstruction of Himself in Ulysses,English,Report,"As he walks along Sandymount Strand in the Proteus chapter of James Joyce's Ulysses, Stephen Dedalus's immediate surroundings prompt him to meditate on the world around him. Yet for all his efforts to read the deeper metaphysical meanings latent in these surroundings, Stephen categorically resists mulling over the one aspect of his environment that would seem to matter to him the most: himself. This is not to say that Stephen never thinks of himself or what is going on in his life as he meanders along the Strand. On the contrary, no matter how far-ranging or obscure his thoughts become, Stephen's musings always channel themselves back into the anxieties he feels over the recent turn of events that have come to define his everyday life. Since he cannot mentally or emotionally deal with these anxieties, however, he spends much of Proteus channeling thoughts related to these anxieties back into the philosophical arguments and creative mental scenes so conducive to his artistic turn of mind. Tellingly, the most effective strategy Stephen has for diverting away these anxious personal thoughts is identifying his situation with similar situations experienced by various literary and historical figures. This process of identification proves effective in helping Stephen circumvent his personal troubles because it calls strongly on his intellect; by forcing himself to invest his intellectual and imaginative faculties in the situations of other people, Stephen is able to temporarily escape the confines of his life and its attendant worries. Stephen's reliance on this mental strategy becomes more and more pronounced as Proteus goes on, to the point where he stops merely identifying with literary and historical figures and starts literally imagining himself in their places. He then takes this progression away from himself one step further, inhabiting imaginary doppelganger selves that place him at an even greater remove from his anxieties without ever letting him entirely escape them. The result is a string of alternative identities for Stephen that generally occur in response to the three main nodes around which his personal problems center: his family, his artistic ambitions, and his Irish heritage. Ultimately, Joyce uses these identities to show Stephen in the process of learning how to deconstruct himself and his personal fears by imagining himself in positions other than his owna psychological process that will be crucial to Stephen in his quest to define himself as an author. Stephen first trades out his identity for an alternative identity in order to escape the anxiety he feels at being born into a lower class Irish family. Intriguingly, Stephen's desire to give up his identity as a member of the Dedalus family is rooted in a supposed identity theft committed by Stephen's father: [I was made by] the man with my voice and my eyes (Ulysses, 3.45-6). Contrary to the natural order of things, Stephen claims that his father has his voice and his eyes, not that he has the voice and eyes of his father. In thus inverting the natural progression of genetic traits from father to son, Stephen gives the impression that his father has somehow taken his voice and his eyes from himin a sense, that he has unrightfully taken two crucial pieces of Stephen's identity. The result is a family dynamic inverted from the norm: whereas most people feel that they derive a good part of their identity from their fathers and other family members, Stephen feels that his family (and particularly his father) has taken a good part of its identity from him. The result is an identity theft that runs oddly athwart of nature. Stephen tries to reclaim his identity from his family throughout Portrait and Ulysses by creating identities for himself that are separate from his identity as a member of the family. He even tries to do so as a child, telling the Clongowes gentry [that he] had an uncle a judge and a uncle a general in the army (3.101-102). By the time that the events in Proteus occur, however, Stephen has started to ponder how much of his identity he does in fact owe to his family. Characteristically, Stephen escapes the emotional strain of the issue by means of a mental problem in which he implicitly substitutes himself and his father into the theological problem of how God the Father relates to God the Son. Tellingly, he first performs this substitution only a few sentences after he refers to his father as taking his eyes and his voice: They [Stephen's parents] clasped and sundered, did the coupler's will. . . . A lex eterna stays about Him. Is that then the divine substance wherein Father and Son are consubstantial? (3.47-50). Stephen then goes on to refer to Arius, the first century heresiarch who argued for the transubstantiality of the Father over the Son (Gifford, 3.50-52). Taken together, these two remarks show Stephen mentally trading places with Christ in the Holy Trinity and invoking a theologian who said that God and Jesus are not of the same substance. Combined, they comprise a mental maneuver that allows Stephen an intellectually aloof way of conceptualizing his own identity as distinct from the identity of his father and, consequently, his family. More importantly, it takes the emotional sting out of what Stephen is really saying: namely, that he wants to be nothing like his father and wants to be as separate from his family as possible. Stephen's anxiety over his family is not nearly as prominent throughout Proteus as his anxiety over his artistic ambitions, however. After reflecting on the decay of the house of his family as well as the decay of all Irish houses, Stephen ponders his desire to create beauty as an artist: Come out of [these houses of decay], Stephen. Beauty is not there. Nor in the stagnant bay of Marsh's library where you read the fading prophecies of Joachim Abbas. For whom? The hundredheaded rabble of the cathedral close. A hater of his kind ran from them to the woods of madness, his mane foaming in the moon, his eyeballs stars. Houyhnhnm, horsenostrilled. A garland of grey hair on his comminated head see him me clambering down to footpace. . . . (Ulysses, 3.106-115) Though it may not seem like it at first, Stephen's above vision of Jonathan Swift cuts across many of his fears pertaining to his vocation as an artist. The first is the poignant sense of isolation that Stephen's self-imposed exile from other people has brought him. Stephen arrogantly declares this exile towards the conclusion of Portrait when he says that . . .I will try to express myself in some mode of life or art as freely as I can and as wholly as I can, using for my defence the only arms I allow myself to usesilence, exile, and cunning (Portrait, p. 268-9). By the time the events in Proteus take place, however, Stephen has had some time to feel the full effect of this exile, including the isolation that prompts him to declare that: I am lonely here. . . . I am quiet here alone. Sad too. Touch me, touch me (Ulysses, 3.433-5). Stephen's imagining of himself as Swift (whom he describes as him me) fleeing from his congregants cuts to the quick of Stephen's professed loneliness. Important to note is that Swift is not only cut off from what he degradingly calls the hundredheaded rabble of his congregation but that his status as a hater of his kind has driven him to a solitary existence in the woods of madness. Crucial to Stephen's imagining of Swift here is that Swift's artistic fame rests on works such as Gulliver's Travels that are thought to be founded upon Swift's deep hatred for his fellow man (Gifford, 3.109-10). Consequently, Stephen's vision of himself as Swift beautifully illustrates his fears of what his self-imposed artistic exile may lead to: namely, that the isolation he already feels may turn into insanity, and that such insanity may be the price he has to pay if he is to ever achieve literary immortality on a par with Swift. Stephen's temporary identity switch with Swift also has interesting artistic ramifications in light of Stephen's refusal to join the priesthood in section IV of Portrait. Unlike Stephen, Swift opted for artistry and the priesthood, a double-vocation the inherent tension of which Stephen calls to mind when imagining Dryden speaking to him/Swift: Cousin Stephen, you will never be a saint. Isle of saints. You were awfully holy, weren't you? (Ulysses, 3.128). Stephen's imagined phrase comes from a similar comment Dryden once made to Swift: Cousin Swift, you will never be a poet (Gifford, 3.128). The alterations Stephen makes are telling: in trading saint for poet, he once again renounces his potential identity as a priest, but he also brings in the question of vocation as it pertains to poetry and the arts. In effect, Stephen seems to be implicitly wondering whether his self-determined vocation as an artist is his true calling or whether he is simply faking a sense of destiny. Stephen may never be a saint, but the tacit question of whether or not he will be an artist worries him enough to launch him into an excoriation of his own literary ambitions the instant his vision of himself as Swift dissipates (Ulysses, 136-146). A final alternative identity of Stephen's that gets at the core of his artistic anxiety occurs not between Stephen and a literary or historical figure but between Stephen and an imaginary doppelganger. Stephen conjures up this doppelganger in one of his more disturbing recollections of his time in Paris: Just say in the most natural tone: when I was in Paris, boul' Mich', I used to. Yes, [I] used to carry punched tickets to prove an alibi if they arrested [me] for murder somewhere. Justice. On the night of the seventeenth of February 1904 the prisoner was seen by two witnesses. Other fellow did it: other me. Lui, c'est moi. You seem to have enjoyed yourself. (3.178-183) Stephens ostentatious reference to the boul' Mich', or the Boulevard Saint-Michel, once again brings to mind his artistic ambitions (the boul' Mich' was a renowned hangout for aspiring young artists), but the context in which he makes that reference seems to suggest some sort of psychological link in his mind between art and murder. Curiously enough, Stephen never explains why he feels the need for an alibi for murder while in Paris. But even more curious is that when Stephen imagines himself being arrested, he does not claim that he is innocent, but that the perpetrator of the murder was some other version of himself that cannot be justified by the paper tickets Stephen proper carries around. What's more, whether or not Stephen knows it, the murder Joyce is referring to was an actual murder committed in Dublin off Stephen Street and charged by a judge named Mr. Swift, recalling not only Stephen's vision of himself as Jonathan Swift but all the artistic anxieties associated with it. Whatever Joyce's specific intention is in blending all of these elements together, the overall impression is that Stephen's decision to leave his family and pursue his artistic ambitions in Paris is so fraught with guilt and anxiety that he associates his decision with murder, whether or not he is consciously aware of it. Try as he might to pawn the blame for this art murder off on a doppelganger, however, Stephen seems unable to fully foist his guilt onto one of his imagined identitiesthat is, onto some other me. The final node of real-life anxiety that Stephen tries to avoid by trading places with certain imagined identities is his uneasiness over his Irish heritage. Once again, a good jumping-off point can be found in Stephen's imagining of Dryden telling him/Swift that he will never be a saint, prompting Stephen to recall that one of Ireland's epithets is the isle of saints (3.128). In addition to shutting Stephen out from the priesthood, Dryden's imaginary comment, by a process of simple substitution, seems to be Stephen's way of telling himself that he will never be Irish. The substitution is especially fitting because, like the priesthood, Stephen also renounces Ireland when he is still very young; now a little bit older, Stephen has had more of a chance to think over what that renunciation truly means. Stephen's grappling with this renunciation occurs more strongly in relation to his acquaintanceship with the Irish expat Kevin Egan. Like Stephen, Egan has forced himself into exile in Paris, but unlike Stephen, Egan spends most of his time remembering thee, O Sionthat is, drinking heavily and wallowing in Irish nostalgia. Characteristically, Stephen finds Egan's nostalgia nauseating (though he willing sits through it), as evident in his summation of Egan's stories about the Fenians: How the head centre [James Stephens] got away, authentic version. Got up as a young bride, man, veil, orangeblossoms, drove out the road to Malahid. Did, faith. Of lost leaders, the betrayed, wild escapes. Disguises, clutched at, gone, not here. (3.241-44) Stephen's description of lost leaders and the betrayed is typical of his view of Irish politics and their constant dynamics of betrayal and failed leadersdynamics consistent enough for Stephen's words to apply just as aptly to Parnell as they do to Stephens. Yet what's really interesting in Stephen's disdainful comment about would-be Irish revolutionaries such as Egan and Stephens is Stephen's contempt for their clutched at, missing disguises. Ostensibly, Stephen is referring to the story that Stephens disguised himself as a woman to escape Ireland (Gifford, 3.241). Yet, though he may not be aware of it, Stephen could just as easily be talking about himself: like the countrymen he has renounced, Stephen too is clutching at disguises in the form of the many identities he mentally inhabits in order to get away from his worries, including those worries related to his heritage as an Irishman. Stephen's inadvertent description of himself as yet another Irishman clutching at a disguise takes on an even more pointed meaning when he criticizes himself for hoping to gain his countrymen's praise by means of his art: For what are you pining, the bark of their applause? Pretenders: live their lives. . . . All king's sons. Paradise of pretenders then and now (Ulysses 3.312-17). Crucial to understanding the full impact of this passage is the passage that directly precedes it, in which Stephen imagines himself as a ghost watching his ancestors hack apart a beached whale: Their blood is in me, their lusts my waves. I moved among them on the frozen Liffey, that I, a changeling, among the spluttering resin fires. I spoke to no-one: none to me (3.6-9). Stephen is again invoking his doppelganger, his other me, only this time his other self is watching violence instead of actively participating in it. The image of Stephen's doppelganger as an isolated specter watching the brutality of his fellow Irish citizens can serve as an apt metaphor for Stephen's detached observation of Irish politics. Yet Stephen also says that the barbaric lust of his ancestors' blood is in him: removed as he may be from their violent activities, he still partakes of their violence by means of being their offspring. Consequently, though Stephen may view Ireland as a paradise of pretenders, he himself cannot claim to be separate from the chronic pretending that he sees as permeating Irish politics and culture. Unlike most of his fellow Irish, however, Stephen's pretending is an artistic pretendingthough he himself is constantly between artistic disguises and traded identities, these other Stephens are at least of his own creation and, on the surface at least, free from the anxieties of family, artistry, and heritage that cause Stephen's true self so much suffering. By the end of Proteus, Stephen has managed to temporarily trade his way through several identities and selves, undergoing a series of Protean metamorphoses in response to pressure of being pinned down by his everyday worries and fears. The result is a semi-controlled atomization of Stephen's sense of self, the effect of which recalls Stephen's violent fantasy killing of a Paris poster worker: shoot him to bloody bits with a bang shotgun, bits man spattered walls all brass buttons. Bits all khrrrrklak in place clack black (3.187-88). Like the shot-gunned postal worker, Stephen's sense of self is blasted to bits throughout Proteus as his anxieties prompt him to search for other selves to temporarily inhabit. The question, however, is whether Stephen will ever clack back into the fully formed artistic self he desperately longs to be. True to form, Joyce never does show Stephen fully put back together again, even after the novel reaches its finish. But by showing him beginning to grasp the psychological process of taking on other identitiesa process crucial to the kind of character creating abilities necessary to become a competent artistJoyce hints that Stephen will one day be the kind of author who can write a book as complex and filled with other selves as Ulysses.

ENG.G0.42.1,Perspectives on the English Revolution,English,Report,"In both Lawrence Stone's Causes of the English Revolution and Mark Kishlansky's A Monarchy Transformed, the authors submit what they have interpreted to be the causes of the English Revolution under Charles I. The way in which they present history, however, differs slightly in their regard for individual figures and their chronological scope and consideration. Stone adopts a predominantly macro perspective on the happenings of the mid-seventeenth century in that he does not actually limit his investigation to that era but instead spends the majority of his essay considering the events of the sixteenth. Discussion of the Revolution itself is limited to a few spare pages at the end, and the bulk of his book is as he intends it to be:limited to defining the long-term factors which made some modifications of the political and religious institutions very probable (Stone 146). For instance, despite his apparent antipathy towards the monarchs (No sensible man could take [James's] claims too seriously (94), royal policies&were opportunistic, grasping, selfish, and rude (127), Impetuous folly (133) and bottomless duplicity of King Charles (138), etc.), Stone largely remains unfocused on the actions of any individual figures. Though he theorizes that a personally more charismatic king&might have continued [ruling]&without running into serious trouble (133), he also claims that Charles I's decisions were no more than one step in a long anterior chain&traced far back into the early Tudor period (146). It seems, then, that Stone is set upon both determinist and sociological views of history; an apparent sacrifice of free will in favor of laying any praise or blame on decades of complicated interactions between large groups in a society. Charles's belief and attempted reinforcement of his Divine Right was not unexpected  monarchs long before him assumed the same. In fact, what the author names as Tudor despotism had its origins long before Henry VII and was enforced in other European countries at the time. However, Henry VIII's break with Rome began a spiral of increasing dependence upon the kindness and power of Parliament to fund and support the Crown, which in turn empowered the Houses to make more demands as the century moved onward. Seen from this perspective, the explosion of the Revolution after Parliament finally stared down Charles I seems quite a logical conclusion. Again, Stone posits this outcome as a result of an incompetent royalty  The proven untrustworthiness of the King inevitably forced Pym and his allies to increase their demands, out of sheer necessity of self-preservation. They now genuinely feared for their lives&they were therefore obliged&to demand control over the armed forces (138)1. To Stone, Charles I's continued, narcissistic abuse of his royal prerogative ultimately led the country into dangerous ground and forced Parliament's hand. But he makes it clear that the social, economic, and political relations in England were well-troubled long before Charles I mounted the throne. Kishlansky, on the other hand, espouses the more micro, historicist standpoint. Though he takes care to write roughly the first half of his book providing the appropriate historical background of Charles's reign, he also focuses his lens much more fixedly on the drama of individual figures and then follows the climax with a long d�nouement detailing the ultimate failure of anti-monarchical rule. Each chapter begins with an italicized and stylized recounting of the personal experiences of characters such as Guy Fawkes or the King and then progresses into a vivid account of the happenings of the Revolution. He develops identities for James I (He was athletic and loved to ride&doted on his Danish wife&crass, not callous (Kishlansky 69)), Charles I (Fastidious in his personal life and methodical in his government&an aesthete (118)), and John Pym (A man of mean estate and modest station&[with] social self-effacement (142)). Unlike Stone, Kishlansky seems more sympathetic towards the monarchs, depicting them as relatable people who made some unfortunate decisions and were preyed upon. In fact, the author's theatricality when relating the lives of seventeenth-century England extends almost into the arena of a historical novel with passages like that of Charles's execution and the monarch's conversation with his ten-year-old son, Henry. The effect of these passages is humanizing and specific; each player in his history is responding to the events in the present and thus elicits more definite consequences. James's loose rein on England created division within his Council and his increasing debt exacerbated his relationship with Parliament. Likewise, Charles gradually loses his grasp of his Divine Right because of fiscal debt accrued and Parliament takes advantage of the King's situation. Thus, Kishlansky's language implies a Parliament and Pym more insidious and opportunist than Stone's self-defending Houses of the people. He writes, The mistrust that members of Parliament felt towards their king, their paranoia about plots and their delusions about Charles's intentions were crucial components in the origins of the Civil War (145)2. In Kishlansky's writing, Charles seems less a self-interested despot and more a misstepping and misguided but ultimately forgiveable monarch who attempted to use the traditional Divine Right in self-defense from an increasingly antagonistic governing elite. It is only after a year of concession and humiliation [that] Charles I&finally decided to seize the initiative from the House of Commons (134). According to Kishlansky, it was Charles I's hand that was forced. So where lay the blame? Attribution is ultimately impossible. However, we may question the effectiveness of these authors' arguments. On one hand, a macro view like Stone's offers a wide range of lessons: because of its broader scope, its outcomes and influences can be applied to the fates of other societies and epochs, which would in turn act to prevent the repetition of the Revolutionary state as such; it serves to shift the culpability to a larger mentality/group of people rather than focusing on the foolishness of just one person; and it promotes and appreciation of the intricacy and interconnectedness of human interaction and consequence in a manner quite sociological. However, this point of view also remains somewhat ignorant of the idea of free will, seems to promote more uncertainty and backward-looking than Kishlansky's standpoint, and comes across as very dry and impersonal in writing. In contrast, Kishlansky's micro humanist perspective is more engaging and makes it easier for the contemporary reader to sympathize with select historical figures long dead. It makes history more emotionally real, more compelling, and more understandable. One may argue that the humanization of these mummified personas helps to fascinate and encourage the literary imagination and enrich the body of discourse about events like the English Revolution and its main players. Personal relation evokes a stronger response in the realm of art because each work is interpreted individually by each reader, viewer, or listener according to his or her own mentality. But then the argument could also be turned to say that the flux of art interacts more intimately with the flow and ebb of larger societal concerns: it is the social context which adds meaning to much canonical literary pieces and artwork, and it is consideration for social context which makes them effective today. In the end, I think both points of view are instrumental in recreating history for a younger generation  for invoking emotion and tempering it with understanding about societal causation.

ENG.G0.43.2,Defining Wild Nature,English,Report,"Defining wildness  even tracing anothers definition  can be a daunting project. In the words of Gary Snyder, The word wild is like a gray fox trotting off through the forest, ducking behind bushes, going in and out of sight (9). Following wild through literature and popular consciousness could be a lifelong project; even within the last few centuries, the word has wandered through such varied connotations as terror, the unknown, desperate and bleak desolation, darkness, immortality and life, mortality and death, and almost everywhere in-between. Within the margins of this paper, I wish to examine specific writers who, in one way or another, have set out through their writings to discuss  at times, to praise  wildness. From them, I do not necessarily seek formal definitions (though those do willingly appear at times), but statements that reveal an opinion or an underlying belief  self-consciously or not  of what, to the author, wild is, what it evokes, inspires, means. Through deliberate tracts on wildness (such as Henry David Thoreaus Walking, Gary Snyders Practice of the Wild, or The Wilderness Act of 1964) and selected poetry  here, a very small sampling from Mary Oliver and Robert Frost  we can begin to piece together the sense of what wild means to us, the contemporary Americans who are, knowingly or not, born from Transcendentalists, still looking to Thoreau for an understanding of who we are, how we live. In many ways, Thoreaus Walking is a project of language reclamation, of massaging a reader into positive  or, perhaps, a reverent  readings of words that had previously incited terror and anxiety. To describe his sense of wild nature1, Thoreau only had access to words that had been used as scare tactics for centuries, certainly including wild and wilderness, but from those words he coaxes inspiration, rather than terror. His reader is even convinced to respect the awful ferity with which good men and lovers meet, even placed in the context of the cries emitted by wild beasts in their native forests (234), an image that might not be expected to strike the typical 19th century American reader softly. In the Oxford English Dictionarys definition of ferity, an example from a late 17th century sermon reads, Is it not brutish Ferity rather than manly boldness? (OED), placing the word as an undeniably pejorative term up against manly boldness. Ferity is, as Gary Snyder notes, of the same Latin root as feral and fierce, and  beyond what Snyder includes  ferocious. But for Thoreau, ferity takes on a bold tone, encouraging the reader to participate in a migratory instinct to join wildness (if one wants to join the good men and lovers that have this awful ferity), rather than giving them any motivation to flee. Throughout Walking, he manages to craft his rhetoric in a way that pushes the otherwise terrifying descriptors of wildness into new, adulatory tropes, reforming what wild can mean, and fostering human desire for nature. Snyder takes up much of the same project of redefinition, though much more explicitly. He methodically recasts definitions from the O.E.D. in positive terms  aiming to define wild by what it is and not by what it is not. Snyder is aware that how we define the terms of our life dictates much more than our dictionaries; our words can be crucial in shaping and crafting our mindsets and interactions, not just in reflecting them. This intent focus on language takes on the form of a deliberate craft for both Snyder and Thoreau. Snyder muses on the nature of language, which is like an infinitely inter-fertile family of species, that reflects (and informs)2 the shifting values of the peoples whose minds it inhabits and glides through (8) before he goes on to his several pages that focus solely on careful definitions, histories, and etymologies. Careful can even be applied to Thoreaus attention to language, which may be a surprising adjective to a modern critical reader of Thoreaus writings. From the first page of Walking, he hones in on the etymology of saunterer in order to develop his point (205), and continues to subject language to scrutiny and close analysis. Thoreau and Snyder, however, both assert that the wild is beyond definition, beyond language, and more generally beyond any cerebral knowledge humans can muster. Particularly for Thoreau, wild nature is necessarily unknowable and always beyond our grasps. Wildness, in this sense, is much more akin to Kantian sublimity than to the desolate wilderness described by 17th century Plymouth governor William Bradford (Knott). In Walden, Thoreau writes, we require that all things be mysterious and unexplorable, that land and sea be infinitely wild, unsurveyed and unfathomed by us because unfathomable. & We need to witness our own limits transgressed, and some life pasturing freely where we never wander (Walden, 366). To be wild is to be infinite, staggeringly abundant, and thus unknowable or unreachable. The truly wild is beyond our human grasps, and being faced with that incomprehensibility is what provokes the overwhelming feeling of awe and presence in wild nature. Snyder also picks up on this, categorizing the way of Great Nature, or Dao in Chinese, as a similarly sublime concept, eluding analysis [and existing] beyond categories (11). When Snyder seeks to explain that our own minds are wild, he draws on our inability for cognitive awareness as proof, writing that [t]here are more things in mind, in the imagination, than 'you' can keep track of  thoughts, memories, images, angers, delights, rise unbidden. The depths of mind, the unconscious, are our inner wilderness3 areas& (17). Snyders point that our minds act independently from our intellect further emphasizes Thoreaus dictum  and definition of what wild means  that we require endless distances between ourselves and an understanding of the wild. This unknown element of the wild is, of course, exactly what was seen for centuries as the terror inherent in wildness. The paradigm of fearing the unknown is certainly not yet extinct, nor is it likely to mature any more wisely in our human futures. As for the unknown in nature, Robert Frosts Desert Places provides a good example of the use of a desolate wilderness, the kind of wilderness defined as a wasteland, in Snyders terms (11), as an evocation of anxiety. The poem takes place in a field that is filling with snow, and the speaker explains his loneliness as parallel to  or, ambiguously, caused by  the falling snow. He anticipates the loneliness will only increase as his perception (and, thus, understanding) of the field fades, as [a] blanker whiteness of benighted snow falls, a ground-covering [w]ith no expression, nothing to express. The sense that the field refuses to speak with him, to explain or express itself, contributes to the anxiety of the poem. This anxiety culminates in the last stanza: They cannot scare me with their empty spaces Between stars, on stars where no human race is. I have it in my so much nearer home To scare myself with my own desert places. Despite the speaker asserting that the fields empty spaces do not scare him, his tone belies this claim. The paranoid and ambiguous appearance of a malevolent third party (the They), along with the conclusion at the end that it is, in fact, desert places that scare the speaker, show that desolation and the unknown have ultimate power over the human speaker, and the only option he has is to pull within himself. The angst surrounding natures and seeming independence, when the speaker ambiguously claims that The woods around it have it  it is theirs (a moment where the reader is forced to question not only how the woods can have possession, but what the it is that they have possession of) returns us to Snyders description of our wild minds. One part of the quotation about human minds deserves a closer look: that the wildness does not just lie in the element of the unknowable, but also in the fact that the hidden thoughts and feelings rise unbidden (17). Snyder, on this topic, also says that the body is to a great extent self-regulating, & a life of its own (Ibid.). This gets at the core of both Thoreaus and Snyders sense of what the word wild is, and where it comes from. According to Jack Turner, in one of Thoreaus notebooks is a note that reads, Wild  past participle of to will, self-willed (Turner, 82). The etymology  the very source and core  of wild, for Thoreau, is self-willed: that is, independent and internally-driven. Snyder agrees, saying that wild (or, willed) plants are self-propagating [and] self-maintaining, that wild (or, willed) animals are free agents, and that wild (or, willed) individuals are [u]nintimidated, self-reliant, independent (10-11). Snyder even locates this concept somewhere external to the English language and to any of Thoreaus unverifiable etymologies, and finds that the Chinese zi-ran, self-thus, is used as an equivalent to wild (5). Dao also contains these ideas; he lists freely manifesting, self-authenticating, [and] self-willed as three explanations of Dao (11). The wild is very much its own, in this framework, rather than some poor, neglected fragment left over by man. To these men, the self-willed wild is messy and brutal, but in a way that evokes our very liveliness. This wild emphasizes our mortality and our place, our belonging, in the life of the whole (Snyder, 12). Snyder begins his revision of the concept of the wild with an image of the ruthlessness of nature: In the wild, a baby Black-tailed Hare gets maybe one free chance to run across a meadow without looking up. There wont be a second (4). Snyder is invigorated by the carnal, hungry wildness of nature. One of his declared definitions of wilderness is a place of danger and difficulty: where you take your own chances& and do not count on rescue (11). Rather than being repelled by this notion, Snyder considers it to be a transcendental experience of awareness, describing it in spiritual terms: To acknowledge that each of us at the table will eventually be part of the meal is not just being 'realistic.' It is allowing the sacred to enter and accepting the sacramental aspect of our shaky temporary personal being (20). This sense of what it means to partake in the realm of the wild (as we all do, whether we acknowledge it or not) is morbid, dark, painful, deeply spiritual and exhilarating. As for Thoreau, loving the Wild means being cheered when we observe the vulture feeding on the carrion which disgusts and disheartens us and [sic] deriving health and strength from the repast (Walden, 366), and it means loving the gritty savagery of wild nature. The sight of an animal feasting on bone marrow open on a trail reminds us of the vast abundance, the strong appetite and inviolable health of Nature, showing us that Nature is so rife with life that myriads can be afforded to be sacrificed (Ibid.). But Thoreau falls short of Snyders exuberance in that Thoreaus sense of the brutal life cycle never quite reaches humans; Thoreau, our early representative of man-in-nature, is largely a witness, despite his claim that we are all a part and parcel of Nature (205). Humans are seemingly exempt from the hunger of wild nature, at least in the wilderness that he knows and writes of. He celebrates the American wild, because the traveler can lie down in the woods at night almost anywhere in North America without fear of wild beasts (Walking, 222). Thoreaus wilderness is messy  but only for the animals. Because man has no need to fear for his own life, Nature is peculiarly fitted for [his] habitation (Ibid.). Mary Oliver inhabits similar contradictions in her poems; she is often guilty of aestheticizing or aggrandizing wild brutality for the sake of poetics, but at times she locks right into the darkness of wild nature, of the sense of the tenuous grasp we have on life. In The Kingfisher, she displays both sides of this dichotomy, writing, I think this is / the prettiest worldso long as you dont mind / a little dying. Her sense of death in nature here is quite healthy, acknowledging that death is but a part of wild life, and is no less beautiful for that. The poem provides a subtle distinction between the thoughtful and analytical human sense of the kingfishers hunt, and the kingfisher himself, who wasnt born to think of the number of fish in the lake, or anything else. It is the human speakers job to rationalize the abundance inherent in the wild, as Thoreau and Snyder both do. As for the kingfisher, he is not meant to care: as a wild animal, hunger is the only story / he has ever heard in his life that he could believe. In 1964, between Thoreaus time and Snyders, The Wilderness Act was signed into law by President Lyndon Johnson. The Wilderness Act presented a legal definition of wilderness, as written by the Wilderness Society. The law explains wilderness in contrast with those areas where men and his own works dominate the landscape (Wilderness Act, 2c). Snyder takes a page from the Act, and his definitions of wilderness can be seen not only as an etymological alternative to traditional definitions, but also as a concurrence with the standards of wilderness set forth by this newer legal definition. The act defines wilderness areas as lands retaining [their] primeval character and influence, which have been affected primarily by the forces of nature, with the imprint of mans work substantially unnoticeable (Ibid.). Snyder, somewhat eliding his definitions of wild and wilderness, comes close to repeating these sentiments regarding what wild lands are. He defines wildness in terms of land as a place where the original and potential vegetation and fauna are intact and in full interaction ad the landforms are entirely the result of nonhuman forces (10). To Snyder, Wilderness is a place where the wild potential is fully expressed (12), and can be defined briefly enough as A large area of wild land (11). The Wilderness Act says that a wilderness area may also contain ecological, geological, or other features of scientific, educational, scenic, or historical value. This seems like an exhaustive list, but there is at least one notable absence: agricultural value. The word wilderness is rarely  if ever  used to describe a so-called useful plot of land. As Snyder points out, 'good' land becomes private property (86). It is partitioned, purchased, and tended (methodically and according to a farmers plan, not natures self-determined order). One of Snyders few definitions that he specifically casts in the negative (defining wilderness for what it is not): an area unused or useless for agriculture or pasture (11).4 Similarly, Thoreaus conceptualization of the rightful Westward journey is that people and cultures exhaust their current landscape, and then move Westward to a new world, where lands are still wild  that is, not used, not yet exhausted. In this sense, Thoreau and Snyder are on the same page with each other and the law of the United States, as they all agree to define wilderness as leftovers  or, alternately, as the land that we have not yet gotten to. A point of contention between The Wilderness Act, Snyder, and Thoreau, appears at the question of inhabitants. The Wilderness Act simply states that, in wilderness, man himself is a visitor who does not remain (Wilderness Act, 2c). But Thoreau and Snyder, in the freedom of the literary genre of essay, as opposed to that of a legal document, both wander within the topic in more ambiguous ways. Thoreau inhabits contradictory notions of mans relationship to nature. From the outset, and multiple times throughout Walking, he draws a strict dichotomy between society and wild nature, clearly favoring the latter. His ideal of Nature is wholly uninhabited, and the reason we are, by instinct, drawn West is that the ideal is the western horizon [which] stretches uninterruptedly toward the setting sun, [where] there are no cities in it (217). The irony here is that the migratory instinct (219) to go into the uninhabited wild asks that men enter nature, to become part and parcel of the wild, rather than society (205). The bulk of Walking includes encouragement to humans to become closer inhabitants of nature; he himself boasts his two years as an inhabitant of wild nature as one of his points of pride. In this, Thoreaus project is a largely contradictory one, one that never quite settles on an answer. Snyder, on the other hand, negotiates the question of inhabitants with further subtlety and greater understanding of what human occupancy means  and has meant over the centuries. His modified definition of wild (of Land) conspicuously cuts the O.E.D.s use of uninhabited. He acknowledges the vast native populations that lived on this land, saying that wild does not mean untouched by humans. Before the mass influx of Europeans, virtually all was wild in North America, and not only that, but [t]here were human beings, too: North America was all populated (6). Snyders sense of the word wild, when it comes to inhabitants, also varies from Thoreaus in that he has a more fluid sense of what a true inhabitant can be. He writes that only since the influx of major blocks of citified mythology (Medieval Christianity and then the Rise of Science) has the natural world been denied& soul, then consciousness, and finally even sentience (13). Because Snyders wilderness has only artificially been disembodied, it remains alive, sentient, present  inhabited. In this sense, it is human society that is less inhabited than the wild. In a twist on a readers expectations, he writes that [c]ivilization is permeable, and could be as inhabited as the wild is, if only it was more accommodating (16). The concepts that evade clear definitions are also those that provoke the most contradictions. Wild is certainly one of those concepts. Wildness exceeds language, it is a sublime category that exhilarates in its incomprehensibility, in its refusal to be encompassed by any one word or phrase. It insists, always, to stay between two concepts or terms. Wildernesses are complex; nature is filled with complicated systems. This complexity is seen as good; wild nature is rich, full, blossoming, and endowed with incredible fecundity (Snyder, 12). Contradictions make literature and nature alike more rife, more alive. Walt Whitman famously writes in Song of Myself the apostrophic question and answer, Do I contradict myself? / Very well then . . . . I contradict myself; / I am large . . . . I contain multitudes (53). But these connotations are relatively recent  and certainly still growing  in the literary and intellectual realm. Thoreau and Snyder, along with others who usher in these new complexities, are both products and bearers of their moving times, and carry with them the language that makes our realities. Continuing to search for definitions of wildness may be an overwhelming task, but it is one that only becomes more and more fruitful. The further we follow wild, it seems, the deeper we can find ourselves in a mess.

ENG.G0.50.1,Rosamond Vincy and the Real Sphere,English,Report,"An unmistakable delight shone from [her] eyes&.Ideal happiness, (of the kind known in the Arabian Nigihts, in which you are invited to step form the labour and discourd of the street into a paradise where everything is given to you and nothing is claimed) seemed to be an affair of a few weeks waiting. (294) In the societal realm in which Middlemarch resides, the demarcation between women and men are starkly defined. Notions of male and female character are, especially to a modern perspective, skewedand it is clear from a modern reading that the effects of this social conditioning cause detriment in the individual characters and their relationships to others in the novel. Perhaps the most resonant of the ill-effects of social conditioning is the character Rosamond, a woman who is guided by the principles of supposed womanhood that have been, since childhood, ingrained into her psyche. She was painstakingly taught, by means of formal instruction, the supposed qualities of womanhood, and because of this, the reader is shown, she exists as Eliots hyper-socialized female character. She wishes to be treated as a delicate being incapable of invoking harmshe manipulates and obtains her desires by emphasizing the female stereotypeforgoing passion and at times veritable emotion for the obtaining of worldly prospects. These prospects are greatly concerned with social mobility and she is, like many characters in Eliots novel blinded by these desires, a fact that brings about her inability to separate the reality of her circumstance, from her conceptions of ideal scenario that are, much like that from Arabian Nights, characterized by the absence of responsibility (mental and physical, it seems), and the presence of prestige Her rather grandiose ideas of life as it should be, and her ignoring of life as it is, results in Rosamonds strained relationship with Lydgatespurred by her devotion to being completely absolved from fault, and her blind attachment to the superficial notions of high-society that her lineage and marriage dont give her the capacity to obtain. It seems Eliot designed Rosamonds conflict of the real and ideal, while contrasting it with that of Dorotheas whose conflict is only further indication of her admirable humanity, to show and emphasize the effects of women operating under an imposing sphere that purports loss-of-self as the only road to success. It could be said that Rosamonds affinity to Lydgate was borne by the fact that his actual past was much of a mystery. This allowed Rosamond to impose her ideas of the ideal mate onto him, and as the ideas she imposed were essentially stunning, in a sense she became the instigator of her own courtship, converting flirtation to love, when the reader knows otherwise. The narrator states, Rosamond thought that no one could be more in love than she was, (Elliot, 295) and the insertion of thought into the equation emphasizes her illusion of genuine feeling. This is one of example of the instances throughout the novel Elliot gives subtle clues to the fact that Rosamonds emotions and truths are not real: she more than once imagines knowledge, and rather than being right, the narrator maintains she is convinced that she is. The disparity between Rosamonds fixation on her marriage to Lydgate, and the fact that he is initially apathetic to it, brings about a conflict that is telling to Eliots sentiment in terms of Rosamond, and women in a broad sense. First, it is clue into the genuine motive of Rosamond, that being to devise a life for herself rather than relying on providence. Lydgate was a mere character in the story she wishes to create, a fantasy in which she exists as an ephemeral entity to be sought after, ultimately achieved and lifted to great, eminent heights. She is, one might say, acting as a woman of the time shouldwith a sense of helplessness, and a faith that her male savior will present himself. What the reader sees, however, is that Lydgate is too operating in his sphere of manhood, as he is far from invested in Rosamond, but rather enchanted by her beauty and girlish affectations. He regards Rosamond imposing of the ideal onto him as a mere tendency of the female mind: [Lydgate] held it one of the prettiest attitudes of the feminine mind to adore a mans pre-eminence without too precise a knowledge of what it consisted in. (Elliot, 234) This inclination of Lydgate suggests that his ideas of the feminine mind, are associated with na�ve delusion and weakness, characteristics that Lydgate is drawn to, although more for his own desire to assuage than for an affinity to the afflicted. In this initial interplay between Lydgate and Rosamond, Rosamonds conflicted real and ideal tangles their ideas of one another, based on the roles they play as male and female. On one end, Rosamonds placing of pre-eminence on Lydgate reinforces notions of male-capacity (not to mention her deeming of him as refined based on surface-level qualities, such as his knowledge of the French language) and as Lydgate is flattered by her assumption, he reinforces her role as one whose mental capacity is lacking and whose mind is dull, but pretty still. To him, she is weaka fact that he relishes. The reader sees this interplay again, more intensely, during the scene of Rosamond and Lydgates engagement, of sorts. And thus, Rosamonds conflict between the real and ideal engendered the outcome she so desiredbut the foreshadowing of future dismay is all too apparent. Describing the character of Rosamond, the narrator states, on page 289, Rosamond was particularly forcible by means of that mild persistence which, as we know, enables a white soft living substance to make its way in spite of opposing rock. Rosamond, perhaps the epitome of female delicacy, so strongly adheres to her ideal world, that she is exasperatingly ardent her manipulation. This idea is manifested most blatantly in her marriage that is strained by Lydgates desire to have a wife that is secondary to his career, and Rosamonds desire to have a husband that unrelentingly places her first. She defies his will even when he has her best interest in mindforgoing his advice to refrain from horseback riding for the sake of posturing with Captain Lydgate. At the onset of their financial woes, Rosamond acts as if Lydgate wishes to spite her, placing the blame on him, when in actuality all he had done was fail to live up to her grandiose expectations. She mistakes his exasperation with her and their marriage as mere moodiness, and dismisses his ill-dispositions to ensure that she is not affected by them. The narrator states, the thought in her mind was that if she had known Lydgate, she would have never married him (Elliot, 471), and what the reader sees, that Rosamond does not, is that Lydgate feels much of the same. Rosamond is unaware of this because she regards herself as the ideal, the embodiment of the perfect female specimen, the woman who no woman could behave more irreproachably than (472), completely free from culpability, a victim of her husband who had a way of taking things which made them a great deal worse for her. The reality of it, however, is that she is childish and artificial, a woman of polite impassibility (609), perhaps the only character who remains throughout Middlemarch, as morally stupid and one-dimensional as she began. Through the fashioning of Rosamonds character, it seems Elliot adhered to a strict notion of femininityone that was perhaps the pervasive notion at the time. The strain in Rosamonds marriage reaches a head, at the point when Lydgate is prone to outbursts of indignation, and his enchantment with his coy mistress has changed to subtle resentment. He realizes, he didnt marry a virtuous woman, but rather his own idealized view of what this woman was based on socially accepted (surface level) ideas. Moreover, he realizes that although he has spent month after month sacrafising without impatience (464) Rosamonds thirst for wealth and eminence and all the things she thinks will give merit to her womanhood is impossible to quench. It is the way with all woman, he says. However, [his] power of generalizing all women&was thwarted by [his] memory of wondering impressions from the behavior of another woman. (468) That woman, of course, being Dorothea. There are two salient interplays between Dorothea and Rosamond in relation to the conflict between the real and ideal. The first being the nature of the two characters own conflicts. Rosamonds conflict is purely of worldly affairsshe wishes to become something that represents something else. She negates her inner vitality and becomes a mechanical being, whose desires are to be adorned and to be scorned through jealously. Dorotheas conflict, conversely is her unrelenting attachment to the good of others. One of the final scene of Middlemarch, in which she meets Rosamond, she assumes, wrongly, that Rosamoneds actions are pure. Dorotheas conflict is spurred by the fact that she herself is a pure human beingRosamonds is spurred by her diluted consciousness. The second interplay moves away from the novel and into its context. Could Elliot have, in her two main female character presented her ideas of the real and ideal? It is perhaps a cynical view from the author (whose attitudes towards woman were rather cynical) because it seems Dorothea represents the ideal, while Rosamond in all of her outward grace but inner spoil, represents the real. And as Dorotheas aspirations are never realized, the real story of women Elliot may be suggesting, is that of Rosamond, who stayed in her place and had her dreams (of marrying rich) ultimately fulfilled.

ENG.G0.54.1,Analysis of T.C. Boyle's A Friend of the Earth,English,Report,"�A Friend of the Earth, T.C. Boyles satirical novel, humorously critiques peoples attitudes toward the environment. These fictional attitudes, however, are not much different from the attitudes of people today. Boyle critiques peoples attitudes by creating situations in which people attempt to establish a relationship with the environment, reenter the natural world, and try to preserve the environment by being near it. Upon realizing that there is an inherent, unavoidable separation between humans and wilderness, humans encounter environmental ethics and deal with their individual guilt regarding the state of the environment. Characters in the novel attempt to bridge the separation by taming the wild, eventually leading to the environments demise. During the part of the novel that takes place in the 1980s, many of the characters spend their time trying to reenter nature. The characters attitudes can be described as both nostalgic and concerned. For example, Ty and Andrea spend 30 days immersed in nature and live off the land, and Sierra lives in a tree for several years. Both of these actions are parts of the environmental movement and are intended to display a relationship between humans and nature and humanitys desire to preserve wilderness. In the end, however, these actions are futile. Ty and Andrea ultimately leave nature, with no obvious outcomes resulting from their actions, and Sierra dies anticlimactically by falling out of the tree. These shortcomings are prevalent throughout the novel. Boyle is able to effectively illustrate the dichotomy between humans and wild nature, by way of these failed human efforts to reenter nature. Humans may want to reenter nature and positively impact the environment, but their inherent separation from the natural world makes this impossible. Humans themselves are sensitive creatures with no effective defense mechanisms other than weapons of their own creation, making it nearly impossible for them to survive in wilderness completely unaided, for extended periods of time. Boyle also uses Mac to critique the good intentions of humans to try to preserve and reenter the environment. Mac wants to save the animals nobody else wants, and he thinks that this is selfless and cool and brave (15). Boyle creates Macs menagerie to depict the complications that occur when humans try to interfere with the natural, wild world. Mac does not understand the intricacies of natural ecosystems and thinks that by intensely caring for these select animals, he can potentially make a difference. Mac and his guests essentially try to enter the wild, but rather than going out into the wilderness, they bring the wilderness inside. Macs intentions, however, are not in the best interest of the animals, and this hinders a potential relationship between humanity and nature. Boyle critiques the selfish intentions of humans when he describes Macs egocentric character. Macs own memorabilia adorn his entire mansion, and Macs attitude reveals that his menagerie is for his own benefit, not the animals. Mac wants to appear cool and brave. While Mac may have established the closest physical relationship to the animals by living with them and even entering the same room as a hyena, Boyle illustrates that simply being physically close to the natural world does not mean that a healthy connection can be established. While Mac may be in close physical proximity to his animals, his selfish intentions and ignorance of complete ecosystem health hinders a meaningful reentry into the natural world. Mac is further depicted as being far removed from wildlife with the names he gives to his animals. Because all of his animals are named after flowers, the animals unwieldy and wild nature is masked. The endearing names transform wild beasts into domesticated pets. Boyle critiques the lack of understanding the characters have of their surrounding environment, because the wildness of the animals is undermined. Interestingly, the names of Macs bodyguards are plain and impersonal. Because his bodyguards both have the same name, Al, there appears to be more of a separation between the humans and the more fancifully named animals. Boyle may do this to emphasize the absurdity of Macs menagerie and downplay the authority of humans over nature. Boyle further describes the attitudes of humans toward the wild and their resulting relationship when describing why Ty cannot sleep. So this is why I cant sleep  the animals. It was the animals all along. Lions in the basement, vultures round the indoor pool, the hyena in the gift-wrapping room on the second floor. Its crazy, thats what it is. And all the while the water is rising (141). Ty, in particular, has a difficult time dealing with all the environmental destruction he sees. He cannot sleep because he is aware that Macs efforts to save the animals are not genuine or effective. Mac is disconnected from the animals and Ty and Chuy are the animals main caretakers. Because of Tys experience as a radical environmentalist, he is able to form a deeper connection to wildlife than Mac, and loses sleep over the state of the menagerie. While the water is rising due to the floods, environmental degradation is also on the rise, both in the fictional book, and in todays natural world. In addition, by describing the odd living quarters of the animals, Boyle addresses the inherent separation between the animals and a human-created society. The extravagant nature of Macs mansion, including an indoor pool and gift-wrapping room, are polar opposite to the animals natural habitat. Boyle depicts the artificial habitat in Macs mansion as a microcosm of the artificial habitat humans have created in essentially every part of the world. Overall, while Mac has attempted to form some type of connection to the wild by keeping a menagerie, the separation of humanity from the wild prevents a nurturing relationship. Ty stays in the mansion, quite simply, because he has nowhere else to go. While many of the characters do not appear to be overly concerned with the wild animals staying in the house, one of the reporters that arrives at the house after Macs death understands the gravity of the situation. Upon hearing that there are wild animals staying in the house, the reporter states, Maybe you can explain it for me, because I think Im missing something here  isnt that dangerous? (279). While the people living in the house were, for the most part, oblivious to the fact that they were living in such a dangerous environment, an outsider did notice. Boyle is criticizing societys false impressions of the natural world. When people become accustomed to their environment, for example wild animals living in their house, they lose the sense of wildness. When exotic animals are domesticated and kept as pets, people are surprised when the creature acts on instinct and bites them. The inherent separation between humans and wild animals needs to be acknowledged and embraced, rather than changed to suit human desires. When people tame and domesticate nature, there will be consequences and the reporter, as an outsider, is the only one that can see this. The slaying of Mac demonstrates one of these consequences. If the wildness of nature is not respected and humanitys inherent separation from the environment ignored, there will be consequences. These consequences of the tumultuous relationship between humans and the environment may not be experienced in the short-term, but will surely be experienced in the long-term. While humans may try to establish a healthy relationship with nature, the separation is inevitable. Mac was killed by the very creature he was trying to protect because he ignored the separation. Boyle is criticizing the oftentimes oblivious actions and attitudes of humans. As stated previously, Mac did not act to reverse any type of ecosystem destruction, but tried to save a select group of animals, which will never solve the plethora of environmental problems plaguing the world Boyle creates. Mac, Andrea, Ty, and Sierra all try to enter and preserve the natural world in their unique ways, and shortly after come to terms with the unavoidable separation between humans and wilderness. There are several psychological effects caused by trying to preserve the environment despite the inherent separation. Because of the consequences of global warming and environmental destruction depicted in the novel, Ty becomes so guilt-stricken that he is completely consumed by it. Im a mess and I know it. Jewish guilt, Catholic guilt, enviro-eco-capitalistico guilt: I cant even expel gas in peace (135). Boyle is critiquing the ethical nature of the environmental movement. There is more to the movement than facts and figures, but a more intrinsic, emotional side to the movement. As is illustrated by the proceeding scenes in the book, peoples guilt does not actually do anything to improve the state of the environment. People need to actually take initiative and act if any progress is to be made. Although the dichotomy between humans and nature is apparent, human actions can still protect the environment and humans need to act in ways that do not ignore the separation, but embrace it. Although environmental destruction does make many people feel guilty, certain circumstances prevent guilt. Boyle acknowledges this when he critiques the behavior of Ty and other inmates in prison. Of course, guilt itself is a luxury. In prison we didnt concern ourselves overmuch about environmental degradation or the rights of nature&and if the world collapsed as a result, all the better: at least wed be out (135). Tys attitude evolved from optimistic to apathetic. People lack concern for the environment for a variety of reasons. Among these reasons are selfishness, lack of vision for the future, and simply the lack of resources to reduce ecological footprints. A Friend of the Earth tackles all of these reasons. For example, because the prisoners themselves are removed from the environment, they do not have any motivation to preserve it. This is in contrast to Ty and Andrea trying to reenter nature to help preserve it, although ultimately failing. Oftentimes, people living in urban environments, people removed from a more natural environment, do not have as much of a connection to the land as people living off the land for sustenance. Because people who are removed from the environment do not necessarily see environmental degradation first hand, they have no incentive to try to conserve. It is necessary to establish a relationship with nature and truly understand its intricacies in order to preserve it, and this is not possible when one is imprisoned. Another widespread reason why people do not try to preserve the environment, in addition to being physically disconnected to it, is a lack of resources. Boyles depiction of the prisoners tackles this issue as well. The prisoners do not have control over the food they eat or the way the facility is run, therefore their attitudes toward the environment likely differ from their attitudes in an environment where they were free to make their own decisions. Boyles depiction of prisoners may be considered analogous to poverty-stricken people in todays society. One major issue facing the environmental movement is the expensive nature of preservation and conservation. In a lot of ways, poverty-stricken families have bigger problems to deal with than people who have the means to live comfortably. For example, paying bills and putting food on the table is a higher priority for many people than saving the environment. Furthermore, buying organic foods and recycled products is usually more expensive than buying virgin products, so many people simply cannot afford to be as environmentally friendly as others. Simply stated, economics may prevent a connection between people and the environment, hindering conservation. Tys attitude towards the environment continues to evolve throughout the novel. Ty first tries to reenter nature, deals with the inherent separation and resulting guilt, and finally tries to bridge the separation. Many humans have tried to bridge the gap between wilderness and the human-built world, and this has been done through domestication. Humans have persistently tried to tame nature to satisfy their own lifestyle. While many enjoy the natural world, there are certain wild aspects of it that some people cannot tolerate. For example, people have suppressed fires and removed wolves to allow humans a comfortable existence within the environment, while still enjoying some aspects of nature. Boyle criticizes this taming of nature to bridge the separation when Ty states, Petunia is not a dog. Shes a Patagonian fox. Above all, Ive got to remember that. It seems important. Its the kind of distinction that will be vitally important in the life to come& (336). In his fictional depiction of the world in the 1980s, Boyle addresses the attitudes of people that want to keep nature wild. For example, Sierra wants to prevent the felling of an old growth tree. Ty wants to remember that Petunia is, in fact, a wild animal and not a domesticated pet. While at one point Ty recognizes the importance of keeping nature wild, he ultimately tames it at the end of the novel. Ty domesticates Petunia, because the fox is one of the last remnants of a wilderness that no longer exists. Ty yearns for some sort of relationship with the natural world. The taming of Petunia parallels the ultimate ending of the book: the environment has been so greatly degraded, that the entire natural world is essentially tamed. While nature is resilient and plant communities begin to reestablish themselves, the environment has lost its sense of wildness. At the end of the novel, Boyle critiques the unavoidable separation between humans and nature once more. He addresses humanitys desire to have a relationship with nature, while taming it to suit their needs. Boyle does this by describing the actions of Ty and Andrea upon returning to the Sierras. We crush carpenter ants, battle wasps, chase mice and birds and bats back out into the wild, where they belong. Andrea&comes back with sixteen precut and measured windowpanes and wields the putty like a glaziers apprentice (348). Ty and Andrea remove the wild from their domicile, and separate themselves from the natural world through the walls of their house. Boyle makes a point of describing Andreas actions in putting windows in. While Ty and Andrea may be physically separated from the natural world that surrounds them, it is still visible through the window. This is important because while they are partially separated, there is still a connection between them and nature. Boyles entertaining novel describes the attitudes of humans toward the environment and their resulting relationship. Through his creation of humorous scenes and characters, Boyle describes humanitys attempt to reenter the wilderness. The struggle that follows this attempt at reentry illustrates the inherent and unavoidable separation between humans and wild, untamed nature. The inability of humans to connect with nature and preserve it in a way that addresses ecosystem function may lead to guilt, but the resulting guilt does not lead to action. Finally, Boyle addresses yet another attitude of humans toward the environment, when Ty tries to reconnect to the natural world and takes Petunia as a pet. The separation between humans and nature, however, will always be present and it is up to humans to overcome that separation if natural ecosystems are to be preserved. It is the responsibility of citizens and industry to protect the environment, because a healthy environment is essential to human emotional and physical well-being, in both Boyles fictional world and the society in which we live today.

ENG.G1.01.1,Clarissa Consumed,English,Report,"From the moment Lovelace writes, Clarissa lives to the end of Richardson's novel, some six hundred pages chronicle the decline and death of the heroine, who wastes away until she is just a lovely skeleton. The meaning of Clarissa's slow and inevitable demise has been explored in a variety of ways: as a saintly martyrdom;1 as a suicide;2 as resulting from a loss of self-respect;3 as a political gesture, 4 and as a methodical self-expulsion from the realm of signification. 5 Clarissa is indeed spiritual, symbolic, political and linguistic, but first of all, the text tells us that she is a real, physical creature: this is The History of a Young Lady. Treating her as such will reap its own contextual and interpretive rewards. Donalee Frega attempts to confront the physical reality of that lovely skeleton in her 1998 book, Speaking in Hunger, which examines Clarissa as anorexic. Clarissa's emaciation and her refusals or inability to eat bear similarity to the disease, so Frega brings the psychology of anorexia nervosa to bear upon Clarissa. She examines Clarissa's family dynamics as a possible cause, and suggests that Clarissa begins exhibiting food-controlling behavior at home around the family dinner table and continues it through her stay in the brothel and her final fast. In each setting, she claims, food represents a way for Clarissa to control her own body, and the people around her, by consenting or refusing to dine. Frega compiles an extensive catalog of food and food-related language in Clarissa, and claims that when her food related behavior is posited as a central theme in her renunciation of the world and when considered from both a psychological and a religious perspective, her behavior in other areas falls into consistent patterns.""6 Also resting on Frega's diagnosis of Clarissa is the claim that Clarissa opens the way to seeing anorexia as part of a language of hungeran effective, though fatal, form of communication. To this end, Frega broadens her exploration of hunger to include the lives of medieval saints, Victorian fasting-girls, hunger-striking Irish separatists, suffragettes, and Ghandi, examples which (like anorexia) are all at least a century removed from Clarissa's own context. Flattening Clarissa's at-times inconsistent behavior into consistent patterns is a dubious goal at best; claiming to do so using an eclectic, transnational constellation of medical, political and religious discourse far removed in time from the text seems even more wide of the mark. Clarissa's waverings and equivocatings in love, the extent to which she may not know her own heart, and the situation of her death in a dichotomy between saint and suicide are all features of her enduring humanity and interest. I hope to refocus attention on a Clarissa who is allowed to be physical and human, and yet is firmly rooted in the eighteenth century, by placing her alongside contemporary medical discourse. Frega's suggestion of anorexia was a persuasive account of some of the physical and behavioral symptoms, and can be pushed back to Clarissa's day by turning to Richard Morton, a physician whose writing on nervous consumption is sometimes credited as the first description of the condition that would in the late 19th century be understood as anorexia nervosa.7 Morton's book, Phthisiologia, or, A treatise of consumptions, was first published in Latin in 1689, and was printed in English in 1694. A second edition appeared in 1720.8 In it he briefly describes various forms of consumption, following each description with several case histories that illustrate the causes, symptoms and progression of the illness. Varieties of consumption include consumption caused by nursing, gonorrhea, syphilis, bleeding, bloody flux, gout, and many others, as well as the disease of the lungs that has since come to usurp the meaning of the term consumption. Nervous consumption seems to stand out in this company as the least spectacular, and must be defined in part by the absence of symptoms that would indicate the others. With the aid of case histories, however, Morton brings the mysterious ailment vividly onto the stage. The too-studious young woman who provides Morton's first case-history for nervous consumption is a close match for Clarissa's condition. Morton describes how Mr. Duke's daughter, aged eighteen, fell into a total suppression of her monthly courses from a multitude of cares and passions of her mind. Soon, like Clarissa, her appetite began to abate, and her Digestion to be bad. Despite her weakened condition, Miss Duke was wont by her studying at Night, and continual poring upon Books, to expose herself both Day and Night to the Injuries of the Air. This continued for two years, until she was much wasted... like a skeleton only clad with skin. Morton notes also what symptoms and disorders are not present: there is no greensickness, no fever, no cough or difficulty breathing nor an appearance of any other distemper of the lungs. 9 For a while, the girl improved under his care, but then asked to be finished with medicines, whereupon, consuming every day more and more, after three months, she was taken with a fainting fit and died. 10 Clarissa and Ms. Duke share a list of symptoms: vanishing flesh, poor digestion , loss of appetite, and fainting fits that eventually end in death. The description of the progress of the illness is also similar. For both Clarissa and Ms. Duke, the progress of the incremental wasting consumption can be noted each day, its inexorableness emphasized in the repetitive language: Ms. Duke consumes every day more and more; 11 Clarissa is consuming day by day. 12 The women wind up embodying a sort of dressed-up figure of Death, as animated skeletons. Ms. Duke becomes a skeleton clad only with skin; 13 Clarissa is a lovely skeleton (for she is really lovely still, nor can she with such a form and features be otherwise). 14 Even with the most determined admirers at hand, if Clarissa has reached this state more than two weeks before her death, we can only imagine that she is not getting any prettier as she wastes away, day by day. Clarissa may share yet another similarity with Ms. Duke: the total suppression of her monthly courses that is the first symptom listed in the case history.15 Indeed, it seems impossible that anyone so emaciated as Clarissa becomes could menstruate. Matters are of course complicated by the fact that another possible cause of amenorrhea is pregnancy, and Clarissa dies too soon after the rape to confirm or rule out that possibility. Lovelace is of the swaggering opinion that it will be very surprising... if it do not happen... that the dear creature is in the way to be a mamma, and he has the stories of Miss Betterton and the French Marquise, both dead in childbed, to support his claim of potency.16 Clarissa's poor appetite and upset stomach, complained of on 27 July, a month and a half after the rape, could be morning sickness, or the want of appetite and bad digestion of nervous consumption. Thus, a genuine medical uncertainty can be added to nicety, shame, and the knowledge of approaching death to help explain Clarissa's cryptic answer when her uncle writes, I ask you, if you have any reason to think yourself with child by this villain? 17 She replies, A little time will afford a more satisfactory answer... than I can give in words. 18 Clarissa's symptoms, like her words, are indeterminate on the issue, because nervous consumption could be masking or mimicking symptoms of pregnancy. Why did Ms. Duke and Clarissa sicken in the first place? When Morton talks about the causes of nervous consumption, he says that it owes its original to an ill and morbid State of the Spirits, and to the Weakness, or Destruction of the Tone of the Nerves. 19 But what causes those physiological precursors? It is the case-histories that seem most illuminating on this count: for Ms. Duke it is her habit of exposing herself both day and night to the injuries of the air and the over-exertion of reading too many books. For the young man in the second case history, it is studying too hard, and the passions of his mind. 20 Clarissa's habit of writing late into the night, so much watching, as her doctor calls it, is thus dangerous both because it exhausts her and because it exposes her to the night air of London.21 Though Ms. Duke dies in the end, Morton does not suggest that nervous consumption is invariably fatal: Ms. Duke improves for a while under his care, and the young man in the second history recovers sufficiently to be alive at time of press. Morton first tried treating the young man with various types of medicines,22 all to no avail, and found success with fresh air, horseback riding, and a milk diet. That treatment has something in common with the disinterested regimen prescribed by Clarissa's doctor. Dr. H. prescribes nothing for you but weak jellies and innocent cordials, lest you should starve yourself, which may seem a remarkably unaggressive course of treatment for a dying girl.23 Morton, however, recommends the use of a delicious diet because the Stomach in this Distemper is principally affected, and devotes some dozen pages to recipes for jellies and jelly-broths made from Partridges, and Mountain-birds, poach'd Eggs, Oysters, the feet of Animals and from certain fish.24 Clarissa's treatment, therefore, is not just an ineffectual hand-wringing on the part of doctor and apothecary, but, along with the instructions to take country air, constitutes a recognizable slate of recommendations for the treatment of nervous consumption. The 1720 edition of Morton's Phthisiologia may well have been available to Richardson (and the close correspondence between the medical histories of Clarissa and Ms. Duke suggests that it was), but by the 1730's and 40's, Morton had been overshadowed by a medical figure on a much grander scale, one who is sure to have closely influenced Richardson. This man was, of course, Doctor George Cheyne, the four-hundred pound author who was friend, physician, and correspondent to Richardson. Cheyne became a household word in the 1720s, thanks to his Essay on Gout and Essay on Health and Long Life.25 The English Malady, his treatise on nervous complaints, was published in 1733 and went through seven edutions in its first three years, six of them authorized.26 Using himself as his primary patient and case-study, Cheyne propounded a physiological system of understanding health and nervous illness that abandoned the Galenic model of humoral temperaments and saw the body as a machine.27 Nerves occupied a central place in this mechanical system, but not nerves as we understand them today: Cheyne's nerves were tiny tubules filled with fluids that were responsible for producing feeling. Persons with weak nerves were more sensitiveto pain, to disease, and to emotional affect. Thus when Cheyne wrote about nerves, fluids and constitutions, he wasn't only writing about pathology: he was writing of the emotional sensibility on which the English upper classes prided themselves.28 Cheyne believed that the modern world, with its imported luxury goods and city living, posed a great threat to the upper-class body, his included. When he wrote about the city, Barker-Benfield says, his own unhealthy corpulence corresponded to London's. 29 His critique of societal and personal practices converged as he advocated for careful, abstemious management of diet to achieve good health. It is certain that Richardson was aware of Cheyne's ideashe is even believed to have helped prepare The English Malady for the press.30 The theories of illness and health outlined in The English Malady provide a useful tool with which to unearth the cultural, moral, spiritual and medical connotations of both Clarissa's suffering from the quintessential English malady, and the discussions of constitution in Clarissa, in general. When Clarissa opens, the young heroine seems to be the picture of both health and beauty. Lovelace rhapsodizes, Such a constant glow upon her lovely features; eyes so sparkling; limbs so divinely turned; health so florid; youth so blooming; air so animated... 31 Why is Lovelace so preoccupied with her health? Clarissa's health is an important selling-point in the market for heir-producers, and someone with Lovelace's hobbies probably has a practiced eye for spotting women with constitutions ruined by certain dreaded occupational diseases. So Clarissa's beauty, virtue, purity and health are bound up together from the start. But there's more to it than that. As Lovelace narrates his abduction of Clarissa, he devotes nearly 700 words to his first sight of her, practically dissecting her as he describes each body part and article of clothing in detail, from her Brussels-lace mob to her blue satin shoes without lace 32 He pauses between the headdress and the prettiest foot in the world, however, to talk of her health once more. She is wearing no hat or hood, because she loves to use herself hardily (by which means and by a temperance truly exemplary, she is allowed to have given high health and vigour to an originally tender constitution). 33 This observation provides a prehistory of Clarissa's constitution, relevant to the medical events that follow, but also important personal and psychological history. Since she is allowed employs that verb in the sense of acknowledged, we know that this medical history is part of Clarissa's generally acknowledged reputation for beauty and virtue. Clarissa is the author of her own constitution, and her community knows this and admires her for it. The history of Clarissa's constitution suggests that she was born with weak nerves. How did she get them? Cheyne places the blame firmly upon her parents. According to him, children are punished for the faults, follies, and indiscretions of their parents, not by direct divine smiting but according to the physiology of the nervous system.34 Crazy putrified parents, suffering from gout, old age, and the effects of riotous excesses, produce a child with weak solids. The very fibres of her human machine are more tender and susceptible to injury than the parents' were. Furthermore, the nerves of the child are at first filled with and bathed in the same sizy and corrosive juices that corrupt the parental bodies. With careful management and low diet, however, the fluids of the child may be sweetened. Age, Cheyne concludes, recompenses the caution, care, and sufferings of their younger days, by a greater degree of strength, more chearfulness, stronger spirits, and a greater length of days than is common. 35 Readers of Clarissa may at times join Lovelace in wondering how the Harlowe family produced such a daughter as Clarissa. Her family was imposed upon her by Nature, when she was in a perverse humour, Lovelace decides.36 Under Cheyne's system, however, such reversals appear so natural as to be almost predestined, and curiously redemptive. Clarissa, the youngest child of her parents, inherits from her gouty, temperamental father a weak constitution, one that needed temperance truly exemplary to repair it. Clarissa's careful abstinences are the antidote to her family's bitterness and intemperance, the tool by which she has remade herself into a blooming beauty. They are alsoand here is the redemptive partwhat makes her a morally superior person. As her cousin Morden puts it, Clarissa's prudence (eminent as it was) [was] rather the effect of constitution than experience. 37 Cheyne saw dietary rigor and spiritual discipline as closely akin, writing to Richardson that bodily health is next to eternal Happiness and a great step in an honest heart towards it. 38 He also describes Richardson's diet as a Purgatory, with a heaven of good health waiting for him if he can only endure it. The earthly, physical discipline of dietary regimen is good training for spiritual discipline, and Clarissa is a successful graduate of that program. As Anna Howe describes Clarissa's closely regimented daily schedule, she emphasizes how her discipline in keeping an economy of hours gives her time to perform private devotions, pursue improving conversation, manage the household, and visit the neighborhood poor. Cheyne and Cousin Morden would both have it that she first learned her illustrious habits first out of the simple need to survive with a weak constitution. The constitutional origins of Clarissa's virtue and discipline should not cause those qualities to be valued any less, but they should underscore why she clings to them so fiercely. It is nor merely a matter of prudishness or reputation: Clarissa clings to her virtuous, careful self-management because it is the source and safeguard of her once-precarious health. In Lovelace, Clarissa encounters a constitution that is the direct opposite of her own. He was strong from birth, a curl-pated villain, full of fire, fancy, and mischief; an orchard-robber, a wall-climber, a horse-rider without saddle or bridle, neck or nothing, as Anna envisions him.39 This natural fire and fancy makes him a sturdy rogue from the beginning: again and again, characters in Clarissa are inclined to explain Lovelace's behavior not by saying boys will be boys, but by pointing to his constitution.40 Lovelace is likewise quick to excuse himself, on those moments when he bothers with introspection. I have a confounded mischievous [heart]--by nature too, I think!A good motion now-and-then rises from it: but it dies away presentlya love of intriguean invention for mischiefa triumph in subduingfortune encouraging and supportingand a constitutionWhat signifies palliating? But I believe I had been a rogue, had I been a plough-boy. 41 This window into Lovelace is a tangle of contradictions: first he blames his heart, and then his constitution. First it is his wealth that allows him to pursue a roguish lifestyle; next he claims that his roguery is so intrinsic, he would be this way had he been a common plough-boy. He is no theorist of roguishness in himself, though in others, he considers signs of good health, a constitution so firm, health so blooming, eyes so sparkling, as signs of a rogue, or room for a rogue. 42 And anyway, this impetuous, dashing prose was never meant to weigh the influence of good and evil, body and fortune, heart and constitution: it is to show off his high spirits and to boast of how, though he spared his Rosebud this time, he will never be done with making mischief. Clarissa decides quite early on that constitution has little to do with itLovelace has no heart at all. She disputes the point with Anna in a midnight letter in what is evidently an ongoing conversation about Lovelace: You would have it... that his variableness and levity are constitutional, owing to sound health, and to a soul and body [that was your observation] fitted for and pleased with each other... But I used to say then, and am still of the opinion, that he wants a heart. 43 And the heart, she has previously declared, is what a woman should be judging in her choice of a husband. After Clarissa complains of Lovelace's shockingly discomposed letter from the coppice at daybreak, Anna admonishes, Your expectations of such a Christian command of temper in him, in a disappointment of this nature especially, are too early by almost half a century in a man of his constitution. 44 Of all people, Anna may be willing to understand Lovelace and excuse him on constitutional grounds because she is almost a match for him. Her investigative work unravels many of Lovelace's secrets, though she fails to get the news to her friend in time, or to arrange a dramatic rescue by Mrs. Townsend. She is high-spirited and has a taste for mischief, writing of her own tormenting of Mr. Hickman, How difficult to withstand constitutional foibles! 45 How difficult indeed. Cheyne goes so far as to say that it may be better to be born a Clarissa than a Lovelace or an Anna in constitution. Those born with weak nerves must pursue a temperate course: It is a misfortune indeed, to be born with weak Nerves, but if rightly us'd and manag'd,... it may be the occasion of greater felicity: For, at least, it is (or ought to be) a fence and security against the snares and temptations to which the robust and healthy are expos'd, and into which they seldom fail to run, and thereby reduce themselves to the same, or perhaps a worse state than those whose Misfortune happen'd to be, the being born thus originally subject to Nervous Disorders.46 Cheyne himself claims to have had an originally weak nervous constitution which he aggravated with excesses of food and drink, lack of exercise, and living in close-crowded London. It may not too far overestimate Cheyne's ego to suggest that much of his medical system was meant to thumb his nose at the naturally healthy: they were given to debauchery; it was the sickly who must necessarily become sweeter and purer, passing through purgatorial dieting and on into the heaven of good health. Though Cheyne gestures at the historical archetype of empires fallen through luxury, and spends his career advising sufferers of nervous illness on how to sweeten and strengthen themselves, he is constructing a discourse where the most delicate and nervously afflicted Englishpeople are the best people of all. Richardson works within this construction each time Lovelace's actions are attributed to his constitution. If Lovelace is a product of his constitution, however, it may be health, itself, that is held up for suspicion as a danger to the self and others. When the novel opens, Clarissa, the once-sickly child of crazy putrified parents, is poised for a long, healthy, and virtuous life. Unfortunately for Clarissa, a good constitution, once established, may easily be ruined. Cheyne sees three main models for ruining a constitution: First, accident or injury may obstruct the fluids. Second, a too-poor diet, together with an excess of bodily labor and exposure to injuries of weather or deprivation of the necessaries and conveniences of life can ruin the constitution in short order. Third and last, rioting in sensuous pleasures ruins the health of many a rogue. 47 The first model does not seem to apply to Clarissa. Rape certainly constitutes an injury, but not of the sort Cheyne means. Since a strong and healthy nervous constitution involves all of the nerves facilitating an unobstructed flow of fluids to all parts of the body, the injuries capable of ruining constitutions are the sort that leave behind broken bones, humps, or other deformities that physically obstruct the passage of the fluids and require surgical attention.48 The other two causes are a better fit. Obviously, Clarissa has no more rioted in sensuous pleasures than she has been left with a hump. The dose of opiate she was given against her will, however, combined with a naturally weak constitution, may indeed have done the sort of lasting damage usually seen from habitual overindulgence in liquor. As even Lovelace says, If these somnivolencies (I hate the word opiates on this occasion) have turned her head, that is an effect they frequently have upon some constitutions; and in this case was rather the fault of the dose than the design of the giver. 49 But is not wine itself an opiate in degree? he goes on to ask. Lovelace, who has a strong and healthy constitution, thus far resistant to his debaucheries, is unable to conceive of the serious effects that even food and drink (and certainly drugs) can have upon a weaker one. Deprivation and exertion also likely play a role in the decline of Clarissa's health. Even before she leaves her parents' house, Clarissa's family turmoil and emotional distresses have disrupted the carefully managed existence that Anna describes in her obituary. Habitually, after taking her six hours of allotted rest, Clarissa rose and spent three hours at study or in her closet, during which passed her epistolary amusements. 50 Quite early in the novel, letter-writing escapes its usual bounds, with letter-writing now beginning at midday, afternoon, and midnight, and sometimes being pursued all night long. Richardson's writing to the moment has been criticized as too voluminous to give his characters a moment to do anything other than write. Add to the sheer volume of pages in Clarissa the conceit that almost all of these letters existed in both a draft copy and a fair copy, and the time and effort involved in all of this composing, revising, transcribing, quill-sharpening and heart-wrenching correspondence seems even more staggering. In the case of Clarissa, the excessive volume may be precisely the point: she is exhausting herself with every letter she writes. The physical connection to her writing is apparent when she writes to Anna of the rising bitterness which will mingle with the gall in [her] ink. 51 It is almost as if the ink is one of her bodily fluids, made of her bile instead of oak galls, as if the difficult letter drains her body even as it drains her emotional resources. To make matters worse, Clarissa exhausts herself under just the conditions of too-poor diet and inconvenient lodgings that Cheyne warns of. She is exhausting herself in London, where the city air is accounted far more unhealthy than that of her family's home. Cheyne warns specifically about the unhealthy, inconvenient lodgings in prisons, deserts, ships, monasteries and hermitages; the sponging-house is the next thing to a prison, and Clarissa's health takes a notable turn for the worse after her stay there. Belford describes it as a horrid hole of a house offering amenities considerably below below the standard for the conveniences of life Clarissa is accustomed to. Belford notes the windows dark and double-barred, the tops boarded up to save mending; and only a little four-paned eyelet-hole of a casement to let in air; more, however, coming in at broken panes than could come in at that. 52 Though she has a bed, she is not using it because she is afraid to undress or lie down behind a door she cannot lock. Quite possibly her adamant refusal to eat also has to do with that unlocked door and the fear of being drugged once more. And, of course, since Clarissa has been unable to lie down, and has scarcely been sleeping, she has been awake all night in all of that dangerous air. These factors taken together, as Cheyne or Morton would be quick to say, are more than enough to bring on a nervous illness in a constitution that was delicate to begin with. The influence of Cheyne's theories on Richardson's treatment of constitution and nervous illness in Clarissa seems to have been profound. My hope, however, is that laying Clarissa alongside The English Malady and Phthisiologia illuminates more than mere source material. Both Cheyne and Clarissa seek to discipline the body for the sake of the mind and even the soul. Through Clarissa, Richardson joins a conversation about what it means to be the ideal English gentlewoman, and have to deal with the consequences of being that person. Such consequences include both unwanted suitors and struggles with health. Cheyne knew something about these struggles first hand, but was the first to admit that he was an imperfect patient. Richardson does not seem to have been far better, but in Clarissa, Richardson wrote a perfect patient. Her temperance and prudence make her a medical model and a spiritual exemplar. Her spiritual triumph in the end assures that the discipline learned in physical management was not in vain: the two disciplines are bound together in the physical and spiritual being that is Clarissa. It is my hope that some attention to this bony, carnal Clarissa will have also restored a sense of the realist detail with which Richardson wrote her, allowing a rich sympathy with her whole character, which is at once so strong in spirit and so vulnerable in flesh. To say that her metaphysical state is mirrored in her body is not enough: the chains of causality are intertwined, and making the body the mirror may bespeak a peculiarly modern willingness to divorce the meaning of spirit, symbol or language from the meaning of Clarissa's flesh. In Clarissa, only death can make this sunderance. ""It would have manifested more of revenge and despair, than of principle, had I committed a violence upon myself when the villainy was perpetrated; so I should think it equally criminal, were I now willfully to neglect myself; were I purposely to run into the arms of death."" She concludes by promising Anna, ""I will do everything I can to prolong my life, til God in mercy to me shall be pleased to call for it"" (1117). Later, however, she is content if her doctor merely assures her she is ""clear of any imputations of curtailing, through willfulness or impatiency, or through resentments which I hope I am got above, a life that might otherwise be prolonged"" (1276).

ENG.G0.38.1,Roman Polanski's Macbeth,English,Response Paper,"Unlike many other versions of this famous Shakespearean play, Roman Polanski did not intend to incite sympathy for MacBeth, but rather preferred to emphasize the barbarity and ruthless violence of the title character through his use of disturbing visual imagery and voiceover. Many of MacBeth's soliloquies express his inner torment and emotion so as to garner the favor of the audience. But in Polanski's version, most of these speeches are inner monologues that are portrayed through voice over, so that it is obvious that these thoughts are only inside MacBeth's mind, and are not intended for anyone else to hear. In this regard, MacBeth appears as a more immoral character when he does not vocalize his lamentations, because by keeping them in his own head, he is not making his regrets real. They are confined only to his own imagination. Polanski's take on MacBeth thus highlights the depravity of this overly ambitious man, in that his black and deep desires remain to rot within himself. This scenario is repeated in the beginning after MacBeth is pronounced prince by the rightful king, and also after MacBeth receives news of the impending English force, as he paces the castle while surrounded by his followers. Polanski utilized the tactic of inserting disturbing visual images such as a severed hand, rape, animal fights, bloody corpses, etc. in order to add a more macabre tone to the film. By doing this, he overshadowed any goodness that Shakespeare may have originally intended for the play. In Polanski's world of Shakespeare, MacBeth is not a victim of ambition, but rather, an embodiment of the violent consequences of ruthless ambition. Several scenes add an eerie and supernatural feel to the film, such as the scene in which MacBeth enters the dining room only to find the table full with visitors. But something is not quite right, and Polanski elicits the viewer to notice this by holding the shot for longer than normal. What we notice after this unnatural length of view is the grey figure of the slain Banquo seated in the middle of the table, his back facing MacBeth. What ensues is a horrifying and hallucinatory scene in which MacBeth stumbles backwards, and while shouting, becomes a small figure in the middle of the steps. MacBeth is in the middle/bottom of the camera screen, and his figure is dwarfed by the large setting behind him as the camera pans out. On the other hand, the image of the dead Banquo is now disfigured and covered in blood and floats above the ground. His figure appears larger than life (or death, ha ha) as the camera shoots his figure as a close up from below. The transition between these two visual images insinuates how weak and vulnerable MacBeth is to overpowering supernatural torment of his own mind. I believe that Polanski's interpretation of MacBeth captured an essence of the original work that is sometimes obscured by the humanity that many interpretors try to attribute to the title character. Polanski did not try to attribute all the blame and evil to Lady MacBeth, but rather attributed equal guilt (if not more) to MacBeth himself. With the explicit violence and gory images, Polanski successfully highlighted the brutality of ambition and the evil inherent in uncompromising individualistic gain. This blatant carnage added a supernatural feel to an almost natural film.

ENG.G0.38.2,Julie Taymor's Titus,English,Response Paper,"Modern cinema possesses the ability to present Shakespeare in ways that contemporaries of the Bard could only dream of. But with greater artistic scope comes greater variation in the interpretation of the texts, such as found in Julie Taymor's Titus, adapted from Shakespeare's Titus Andronicus. Taymor chooses to create a Shakespearean realm where Roman times blend with the modern age in a game-like arena. Taymor uses this game-type world to play with cinematic perspectives by inserting a young boy from the modern age as a third party observer, eventually bringing him into the narrative by assigning him the role of Titus' grandson. The boy allows for the audience to become aware of its viewing presence, reminding us that this ostentatious display of violence and revenge is staged for our viewing pleasure. It is like a game in which we lose ourselves, but are occasionally taken back to our position as spectator. How does the final act of Titus Andronicus blend the stage and cinema, the game sphere, and modernity? What tools does Taymor use in order to create this surreal environment? The dinner scene perhaps best illustrates the use of cinema as subject. The final act begins with the two grotesque cannibalistic pies cooling in a window sill, a scene that harks back to 1930s America, complete with upbeat jazzy music. The entire scene is quite theatrical, as Titus makes his grand entrance dressed as a chef to serve his guests their deadly dinner. During the moment when Lucius kills the emperor, the entire theatrical dinner is suddenly paused while the camera, in a fashion reminiscent of The Matrix, swivels around this moment frozen in time. The guests are then abruptly transplanted back to the Roman amphitheatre in which the movie began. We now see an audience composed of seemingly real and modern people, who look on detachedly from the horrible scene of carnage before them. Reading Donaldson's article, I learned that this audience was Croatianpeople who recently experienced one of the most violent and barbaric wars known in recent history (The Wars of Yugoslav Succession). This final act showcases the all of the components in this unreal world: the cinema, the theatre, reality and modernity, and the game sphere. Both the boy, who has been the symbol of the viewer, and the addition of a real audience, which slaps us in the face to remind us of our viewing presence, now place the actors and the cinema as the focus of the film. The film itself has become the subject as all three audiences watch together, simultaneously. Together, we all watch onin horror and detachmentas the carnage finally concludes with brutal on stage murders of four primary players. The beauty in the film is the violence itself, and how by using the cinema as the subject, Taymor is able to allow her audience to consciously watch the ensuing violence in a manner that both appalls and entertains. She makes a mockery of the brutality by showing how ridiculous and barbaric it is when we are able to watch from this perspective.
